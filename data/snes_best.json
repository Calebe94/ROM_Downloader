Some consider it the greatest console ever; others had Genesis, but still recognize that the Super NES was pretty freakin' cool. Regardless of who you talk to, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't like the SNES.[CR]There must be reasons why everyone loves the system, and the top 50 reasons await in this list. Thousands of hours were spent exploring, conquering, and loving these games, and their influences on current game development are countless. These are the cream of the crop of 16-bit Nintendo gaming; read on and remember.",

MK2 was as grisly and gory in our homes as it was in the local pizza shop, and we loved every second.[CR]The expanded roster from seven to 12 gave us more characters to learn, the new stages included brand-new hazards to use against our enemies, and with two controllers we could turn a sleepover party into a tournament of simulated death until the wee hours of the morning... until the one kid whose parents wouldnt let him play bloody video games ruined it for everyone. We hope hes happy all these years later.",

It didnt have much better timing over in Japan, as it launched on the same week as the Sony PlayStation. The stars may have aligned against this gem, but its still worth your time.[CR]While Breath of Fire II was clearly overshadowed by all of that competition, the turn-based combat is just as fun and the story is just as engaging as both Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. Ryu and his friends put on a hell of a show; its just a shame that it serves as an undercard for two big main eventers. Breath of Fire II can absolutely hold its own against those big names if you allow it, it just needs the chance to shine.",

Thanks to the Super FX chip debuted by Star Fox, this was the closest thing to Doom anyone with an SNES was going to play without an expensive PC.[CR]The original Doom engine wasnt used here; a brand-new engine was built from the ground up instead. 22 levels from the first three chapters of Doom made it into the SNES port, but episodes 2 and 3 can only be played at particular difficulties. Aside from these changes, this is classic Doom through and through, and wed bet that 99% of you reading this know exactly what that feels like.  Doom on SNES happened, and it was great.",

Were not sure what to call it, but we do know one thing: The game is pretty damn fun.[CR]Theres not a large learning curve; its very straightforward in both the RPG and beat-em-up sections. However, its accompanied by a stellar ancient Japan-inspired soundtrack, beautiful graphics alive with color, and just enough challenge to make it a very addictive affair. Its not breaking down any barriers for platforming or RPGs, but its definitely one of the top games on the SNES.",

However, at any time Kirby can create Gooey, a blue blob with a long tongue, to accompany him, and a second player can control Gooey while hes onscreen. Instant two-player Kirby action! Kirbys Dream Land 3 serves as a fine send-off for the SNES, as it was the last first-party title released for the system. We think its a great way to say goodbye.",

Yes, that last one is as disturbing as it sounds.[CR]The game played as a top-down adventure, almost like a giant obstacle course for our heroes to conquer, with danger lurking everywhere and power-ups to combat that danger also readily available. Weve never used an Uzi water gun with such glee, and not until Dead Rising would we ever experience the zombie-neutralizing power of a standard lawnmower.

Mickey was thrown into a mystical adventure trying to save Pluto from the evil King Pete, and we reveled in it.[CR]Like the other Capcom/Disney collaborations, Magical Quest featured some solid platforming while adding a few new things like upgradable costumes with specific abilities. Mickey could change between a magician, a firefighter, a mountain climber, and his normal self to get through the adventure, but youd need to be familiar with all four to win. This was another triumph from two major entertainment companies, though the partnership sadly wouldnt last much longer afterward.",

We dont get it.[CR]Each chapter in Ogre Battle starts on a world map, where you can organize your troops, pick classes, etc. Once a stage is selected, the action zooms into the tactical map, where you essentially play a game of chess with the AI. When two opposing units get too close to one another, the camera zooms in even further and a turn-based battle ensues.

The Lost Vikings broke the mold by brilliantly blending puzzle and platforming aspects with resource management ideas that would crop in RTS games soon after. The catch is you control three distinct Vikings, but can only move them one at a time; you can switch between them freely, but only one can be active at any moment. And since each character has his own ability, every level becomes a clever action-based puzzle that played like nothing else at the time... and remains unique even today.[CR]This is the only multiplatform game on our list, mainly because we wanted to focus on SNES-only experiences. But its worth having one on here to represent the notion that the SNES often got the superior version of every multiplatform game, and The Lost Vikings was undeniably better here.",

When you needed a break from the cartoony racing of Mario Kart, you went and played Stunt Race. Its just how things worked back then.[CR]One big advantage Stunt Race had over Mario Kart was variety. Stunt Race gave you five different vehicle types to race with: F-type like you see in Formula 1, a small coupe, a four-wheel-drive monster truck, a two-wheeled car (which looked as odd as it sounds), and a giant semi that was so big it needed its own camera angle. Stunt Race proved that Mario Kart wasnt the only car on the track, and in some ways Stunt Race even surpassed its competition. Its definitely worth a test drive.",

It was pure madness, but it was so much fun![CR]Playing alone wasnt too shabby either, as Super Bomberman posed quite the challenge to those familiar with his exploits. Six themed worlds of eight stages each awaited our little robot bomber as he bombed his way through the adventure, and you could retain your progress via a password system.

The game was very faithfully translated from its arcade original, including the full roster (save one hidden character) and all of their moves. Whats more, SFA2 was one of the best fighting games out at the time, so SNES fans got to enjoy the cream of the crop one more time before saying goodbye. Thanks, Capcom, for the last hurrah.",

Why then did Sim City work so well on a system that wasnt properly equipped?[CR]Its because Nintendo developed the game itself, working specifically to the SNESs abilities and adding in its own pieces of flair to create an excellent port. Only one major change was made: Remember the Godzilla disaster on the PC? SNES brought Bowser in to destroy the city instead. Everything else was maintained, allowing those who couldnt afford a PC in the early 90s to build a city of their own on the SNES... even if we immediately destroyed it afterward.

That is difficulty, but its also why Super Ghouls n Ghosts is such a fantastic game.[CR]Perhaps we were secret masochists back in those days, but we couldnt get enough of Sir Arthurs adventure no matter how many times we died. Powering him up, collecting different weapons, and fighting the ghastly hordes was addicting, and we all got a good laugh when poor Arthur was reduced to his boxers, even if we knew the next hit would kill us. If a game can remain fun while having an insane difficulty, we dont mind enduring the craziness... and thats exactly why Super Ghouls n Ghosts is so dear to our hearts.",

Standing proudly among them is Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, the sequel to NES hit Battletoads, which features some of the best graphics on the system. Unlike most brawlers, Battletoads had a knack for constantly changing the formula each time you got to a new stage, and it made for one hell of an experience.[CR]The first stage has pieces of the level crumbling around you, the second descends into a massive hole in the ground, the third is a screaming-fast turbo tunnel, and so on. It never even has a chance to become boring, let alone derivative. The bosses are massive, the music is rockin', and the ever-present 90s attitude is in full effect--who cares if its a cynical knock-off of TMNT when it looks and plays this good?",

While some of the major enhancements had to be cut, Dracula X still gave fans a quality Castlevania experience.[CR]Dracula X stars Richter Belmont as he fights to save his lover Annette from that blood-sucking jerk Dracula, who is keeping her prisoner inside of his gigantic tower. Admittedly, the Super NES version of this game isnt as strong as the TurboGrafx-16 version, but its still an awesome Castlevania game that serves up some ghoulishly good times. It also serves as the prequel to Symphony of the Night, which many consider to be the best Castlevania ever, so it cant be that bad, right?",

Fighting through the fiery pits of Heck, bungee-jump battling above a pool of phlegm, and zooming through space in the Andy Asteroids ministages all bring back terrific memories.

The Super FX chip powering this puppy was the first 3D graphics accelerator ever placed in a consumer product, and Nintendo had it made just for its new team of galactic animal pilots. Its a damn good thing the game was so much fun.[CR]The on-rails aerial combat of Star Fox brings back a lot of fond memories of blasting through Andross armies with lasers and bombs. We loved flying around the screen, dodging obstacles and doing barrel rolls even before we had to press Z or R twice. The only thing we would change about this gem is Slippy Toad; hindsight is always 20/20, and that damn toad is so annoying we dont want anything to do with him.",

Even as the N64 was dominating sales charts in 1996, Kirby snuck in a remarkably generous, multi-game marathon of squeaky-clean greatness. On one cart came four Dream Land-sized adventures, plus a meaty item hunt called The Great Cave Offensive. Toss in a boss arena and a helping of not-crap minigames and youve got one of the best Kirby packages of all time--much more memorable than Dream Land 3 or the oddball Dream Course, which both fizzled on SNES, even if they were perfectly fine games.[CR]Super Star was rereleased on DS a couple of years ago with even more content, but wed still recommend the SNES original any day of the week. Plus its one of the defining moments of Kirbys ever-changing history, perhaps marking the first time Nintendo experimented with the formula.",

Such storytelling, such characterization from a video game? Actual plot points and personal arcs that show how people change and grow? It was genuinely shocking at the time, and while the dialog may be more than a little melodramatic now, its still no less ridiculous than most game dialog today.[CR]FF2 was also the introduction of the Active Time Battle system, which would more or less power every FF until FFX, which even then was a modified version of something started 10 years earlier. Like most games in our top 10, FF2 was an important game as well as an endlessly entertaining one.",

Its the pinnacle of the Contra series and easily the best all-action game on the Super NES.[CR]Like we mentioned with Secret of Mana and other games in this list, the SNES marked the first time several types of games became genuinely cinematic. As an action game you wouldnt think Contra III would pull that off, but it does so in just about every level. The third level alone has enough intensity to rival Vanquish, which may be the only appropriate comparison.",

Was it the colorful, Yoshis Island-inspired art? The catchy soundtrack? Or was it playing a versus match on the living-room TV and seeing the look on our friends face as we crushed their dreams of winning with a screen-filling garbage block?",

The first two years had more than a few standout titles, but for our money the real rush of AAA games began with 1993s Secret of Mana, an action-RPG that could today be likened to a 2D Kingdom Hearts. Instead of turn-based slowness, you directly control one of three characters, while still able to dictate moves to the other two. The core idea worked great, but it was the atmosphere, story, and music that made it such a memorable adventure.[CR]Secret of Mana marked another milestone for cinematic SNES gameplay, pushing ever closer to the eventual perfection that would manifest in future games.

So, while the action itself is less mind blowing than Contra III, theres more to see and do (namely discovering hidden power-ups and using boss weapons against their pals) in MMX, making it the all-around superior game.[CR]There was also a stronger allure around Mega Man X, as it was a stupidly popular series in the NES days, while Contra was great and known, but didnt command the fervor of Mega Man 2.0. That means millions more have deservedly strong attachments to MMX, which also counts for something.",

If it had a cool (and misleading) CG commercial like FF7, odds are it would be the game most often trumpeted around as the Best Thing Ever.",

And racing would never be the same again.[CR]Though Mario Kart as a concept has been iterated on many times, and as a concept has been pretty much perfected, we still love the original in its own way. It wasnt bogged down by at times clunky new abilities or crummy online support.

Released in a huge box that contained a strategy guide with puke-scented scratch-and-sniff stickers, Earthbound was clearly proud to be different. Its characters and bizarro world were rich with humor and spirituality, and the psychedelic color palette and contemporary setting contrasted sharply with the medieval fantasy RPGs on the market.[CR]While Earthbounds game mechanics stuck pretty closely to the traditional JRPG template, its surreal world, excellent localization, and brilliant experimental soundtrack created an experience unlike anything else. It also contains one of video gamings very best endings, a scary, touching climax to a game that, despite its jokes and wackiness, proudly professed the power of friendship and love. If you have a taste for the odd or weird, Earthbound cannot be recommended enough, theres really nothing else like it.",

But before they left behind two dimensions to then define what a 3D platformer was in Mario 64, they decided to make one last 2D adventure for the SNES. Using their considerable expertise and knowledge of platformer design they created a spin-off to Super Mario World starring Yoshi thats still seen by many as the pinnacle of design for the genre.[CR]Just as platformers were becoming edgier and focused on slick visuals, Miyamotos team doubled down on cuteness, but Yoshis Islands crayon-colored visuals masked a game full of incredibly sophisticated 2D game design. With levels custom-made for Yoshis floating, butt-stomping, and egg-throwing attributes, each new area was cleverer than the last. The boss fights were some of the best in franchise history and even a screaming Baby Mario couldnt ruin the fun. Yoshis Island proved that classic gameplay could still matter in the mid-90s, and still does today.",

Bison; the new fighting speeds created fresh fighting strategies; and the precise timing on special moves now required because of that fighting speed made pulling off some moves more difficult than ever.

The gameplay--a mix of exploration, puzzles, and combat--strikes a perfect balance between rich complexity and elegant simplicity, all across the backdrop of two impressively expansive overworlds. Looking at LTTP today, it almost seems like a modern game that's been given a 16-bit treatment.[CR]Its dungeon-puzzle format has influenced countless games since, but even 20 years later, none have reached LTTP's level of perfection. Its dungeons are challenging without being tedious, and every puzzle's difficulty is carefully crafted. And while the story is basically one giant fetch/rescue quest, it's completely devoid of filler.",

They save not just the world, but reality itself, and it all starts with a silent everyman hero defiantly sleeping the day away; there is no comparison for the journey taken and the places seen in Chrono Trigger, and we doubt any RPG will ever come close. Theres just so much variety in design, thought, and execution that only a dream team of Japanese developers could pull it off without making it a confusing mess.[CR]The buildup to the games final battle is suitably engrossing, but its the ending that really seals the deal for Triggers undying adoration. A teary-eyed goodbye from friends and allies, all wrapped up with a whimsical, Miyazaki-esque adventure through the skies with nothing but a handful of balloons. Movie magic on your SNES, at the same time everyone is flipping out over the Saturn and PlayStation. Oh, if only we knew what we were leaving behind...",

Nowhere is that more true than Super Metroid, which drastically improved on both its predecessors by adding a map, new powers, new monsters and insane amounts of detail crammed into every claustrophobic room. And that detail is the real genius of Super Metroid--how its story is told and how planet Zebes and its denizens are conveyed; the game tells so much with so little, using subtle moments and music cues to accentuate events that other games would shout from the heavens. In this regard, its only real modern equivalent is Portal. Even BioShock, which literally states its purpose, is blunt by comparison.[CR]Its explorative, backtracking nature was copied by Symphony of the Night, and more recently, Shadow Complex, proving its endlessly repeatable nature. It was aped five years later, now 18 years later, and will continue to inspire new titles into the future. Outland, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Cave Story, and others take their cues from this towering achievement in 2D gaming. Nintendo seems unsure what to do with this series, having handed it off to Retro Studios 10 years ago then taking it back only to release the backpedaling Other M--how about, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, you make that next 2D Metroid everyone has been waiting for?",
