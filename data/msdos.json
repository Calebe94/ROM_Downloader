                "plot": "While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'etat. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place. Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements. The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars. The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.",

                "plot": "Wolfenstein 3D is an episodic first-person shooter and a follow-up to the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein. The game puts the player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes: the first distributed complete as shareware; the second and the third available after registration; and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the Nocturnal Missions pack. In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. is captured, but overpowers a guard with the help of a concealed knife and manages to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Fuehrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault. Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate \"push walls\" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors. Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers, and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest). The player character has a number of lives; once he loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).",

Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage. Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave. The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.",

However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.",

The Spice is the basis of interstellar travel and thus the standard of the Imperial economy. To increase productivity, The Padishah Emperor has invited three powerful Houses (Harkonnen, Atreides and Ordos) to compete against one another economically and bring up spice production. Competition among these houses begins peacefully but soon turns ugly as they battle each other with armed troops, advanced weaponry, and spies. The planet itself is also hostile, with dangerous sandworms inhabiting the spice fields. Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed. The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect. After a mission is completed, the player can select the next mission on a map of Dune. This choice determines the layout of the next map to be played, but has no effect on the overall campaign.",

The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen. If the ceiling of the area is covered by too many bubbles, it will gradually descend; the game is over when it nearly reaches the player-controlled pointer. Should the player fail to release the bubbles within a specific time limit, they will be released automatically, unaffected by the pointer's aiming. A two-player mode is included as well. Each player competes on an area occupying half of the screen, dealing with identically generated bubbles. Whenever a player successfully disposes of a bubble group, a part of it is transferred onto the opponent's part of the screen. The game features the two dinosaur protagonists (Bob and Bub) as well as other characters from Bubble Bobble, even though the two games have distinctly different gameplay.",

He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn. Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game. The game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion. The game contains adult situations and semi-implicit depictions of sex.",

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.",

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

Getting out of the cell and picking up a weapon is just the beginning; the ultimate goal is to acquire the war plans of the Nazis, and escape from Castle Wolfenstein alive. Castle Wolfenstein is notable for being the first game that incorporated stealth-based gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through the top-down corridors and rooms of the castle. The main gameplay challenge lies in dealing with the guards who patrol the castle and will be alerted to any noise made by the player. It is possible to shoot the guards, but the ammunition in the game is scarce, and some guards are very hard to kill, so the preferred course of action is moving without being noticed. If the player surprises a guard with a gun drawn, the guard will surrender, and the player will be able to frisk him for valuable items. The player should also search the treasure chests scattered across the castle. Some of them contain war plans, which are essential for winning the game; others have useful items, such as bullets, grenades, bulletproof vests, and guard uniforms. The uniforms can be worn for disguise; however, higher-ranked SS guards will be able to recognize the intruder. Chests might also contain food and beverage; imbibing alcohol will result in a temporary loss of aim and balance for the player character. The game's sound effects include some of the earliest examples of digital voice samples. The guards would sometimes shout out short phrases in German in an attempt to stop the protagonist.",

Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight. When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.",

This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. The game allows to play up to two players on a same screen, however in the C64 version this option has not been implemented. C64 version was also stripped off in the other areas, such as: only one enemy can engage the player at a time or there are only two types of dragons instead of three.",

The story is the same as in Doom: You are some soldier performing his monotonic duties in a space base on Phobos -- when suddenly your base is attacked. The only way out is through. Equipped only with a pistol, you start to shoot your way through the mazes. Early versions were text-only: instead of DOOM's 3D environment, the game world is rendered as a 2D grid of ASCII graphics (sound offects were borrowed from the original game). A later update added an optional graphics mode, using tile-based artwork, and a soundtrack of remixed DOOM tunes plus original material. Apart from the style, this game is a straight Rogue-like dungeon crawler. The gameplay is turn-based, with each action taking a certain amount of time. As in a role-playing game, the character has different stats that increase with his experience -- he can reload faster, do more damage, shoot more accurately etc. During the game, you find different weapons and power-ups, all well-known to doom players (blue sphere power-ups, green armor etc.). The game is freeware and was written in FreePascal, using the Valkyrie library by the same developer.",

He can knock them out with punches and kicks and a number of extra weapons stored in his utility belt. These include batarangs, which come in standard and self-seeking varieties, and smoke bombs that stun enemies for a while. In addition, Batman can shoot from his grappling gun and unleash a deadly swarm of bats towards enemies. All of these weapons have limited ammo, however, that must be collected. Other special tools Batman can use include the grappling hook to reach high places or swing across chasms, and his cape, which can be used to slow falls.

Players start by choosing two students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will.

Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used.

The life cycle is self-explanatory: sign up for a case, travel between locations questioning witnesses, obtain warrants, and make arrests, and you have approximately a week to do so. The options you can do in each location are the same: you can question witnesses, look up evidence reports, or contact Crime Net to receive additional information about the suspect such as features, hair and eye color, auto, and sport. If you're lucky, you can contact other informants like Bart Samson and Vinnie the Squealer. Once you get enough information about the suspect, you can transmit this information to Warren the Warrant Robot to make him get a warrant for you. If you're not sure about the information you've entered, you can look up the dossiers on each suspect. Unlike the rest of the Carmen Sandiego games, you're given a quiz just before you get promoted, requiring you to look up the reference that came with the game. If you keep get promoted, you may find yourself in the hall of fame. Locations include (but not limited to) Kathmandu, Dar-es-Salaam, Baghdad, Manila, Lima, Port Moresby, Singapore, New Delhi, and Tokyo. You can also travel to ACME HQ in San Francisco, but the only thing you can do is start a new case, or assign a new detective.",

The similarity to Sonic the Hedgehog manifests itself in Jazz's uncanny speed, and the fact it increases the more he runs. However, the rest of the gameplay mechanics are different. The game is primarily a shooter, meaning that in order to defeat his enemies, it's not enough for Jazz to jump over their heads. Jazz starts with a blaster, but during the course of the game acquires other weapons, such as grenade launcher, flamethrower, TNT, etc. Jazz can also pick up various power-ups, including a force shield, a hoverboard that allows him to float in the air, a bird that will fight on Jazz's side, and others.",

Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled. Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options - you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though. You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It's these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There's also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who's winning between you and Glomgold. You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill ... Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it. Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more. The jungle features Scrooges' nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus' backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress. Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down. Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge's niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others. Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.",

The actual jumping is performed using the mouse buttons (for jumping and landing) and by moving the mouse up and down (to angle your jumper in flight), a system which takes practice to master. There are several factors that affect the outcome of a jump, of which the most important is timing. A poorly timed \"take off\" will most likely drag you down and force you to land prematurely. Other factors include wind strength and direction as well as a certain knowledge of the hill you're jumping from.",

Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again? Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Use\" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to \"die\" in Larry 5, and the amount of \"dead ends\" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the \"right\" solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.",

Foes include spiders and humans - make their lives a misery by invading their homes. A Quick Game option focuses on battles with other groups of ants, and a full Tutorial mode is provided. Biological detail of real ants is provided, to help make the package more educational. In the full game the player starts out as the black queen ant who must start an ant hill and produce offspring to start the first colony. They control the output of types of ants between soldiers, workers, and breeders. Soldiers fight the enemy red ants and protect the ant hill, workers maintain the food supply and build out the ant hill, while breeders are used to start more ant colonies in the effort to take over the human's property. The player can switch from controlling one ant to another as necessary to do different tasks in the game directly. They can go out on the surface and collect green food dots, call in the troops and take down spiders and caterpillars or invade the red ants' hill and kill them off. While out on the surface it is important to be careful not to drown in the rain or get killed by the lawn mower. When there are populations of breeders, they can be dispersed to other sectors of the yard and house within three sectors of the current sector you're operating from. Once a sector has a black ant hill on it, the player can move over to the newly populated sector and work from there to continue furthering the black ants. The game is won when the red ants are exterminated from the play field and the human and his cat and dog are driven from their house by the overwhelming ant infestation which has been waged on them.",

The enemies can only chase Digger through the tunnels he creates - they cannot dig through the dirt themselves. Digger's defenses consist of being able to shoot a single, rechargeable shot in the direction he is facing with F1 (which recharges after about thirty seconds), crushing his foes by digging underneath a gold bag and letting it plummet down, crushing anything in its path, or by collecting the bonus cherry that sometimes appears, causing Digger to become temporarily invincible.",

You start out in an alley and need to get inside the apartment by climbing on garbage cans and a fence. Next, jump on a clothesline and through several open windows while big dogs try to eat you and people throw garbage at you. Outside of the apartment complex you can score points by eating the mice that run across the clotheslines. Once you've jumped through a window you enter a room where you play a randomly assigned mini game. These mini games include: eating all the fish in a fish bowl, stealing milk from a bunch of bulldogs, pushing a birdcage from a table and eating the bird, catching mice inside a big cheese, pushing vases from a cabinet. To make things harder there's always a broom inside every room that tries to knock you around. You score points by completing the mini games within a certain time (the faster the better). After you've completed a mini game you're back in the alley. Make your way back inside the apartment complex and you get a chance to play the love-cat game: try to reach the lady cat on the top row of hearts while rival male cats and cupid's arrows knock you down. After you've mated, the difficulty gets cranked up a notch.",

In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty. The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.",

The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian. Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy. The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.",

And they had used the drug money for an effective arsenal, from missiles to fighters and more. Gather intelligence, decide on strike targets, and launch planes to accomplish their missions. Take over any plane in flight if you think they need help. Send in DEA agents to gather more intelligence and resupply local rebels. Can you win the war? ATAC can be described as two games in one. On the strategic level, you need to figure out how the drug barons are forming their pipeline and the best way to destroy the pipeline while causing minimal damage to the civilian population, while defending your own base against intruders and attackers. You can order recon flights or gather intelligence from rebels and DEA agents on the ground. When you get enough intelligence, you can issue target orders to up to 4 crafts (F-22's or AH-64's). and they'll go accomplish those missions if they can. Once you're off in the air, the game becomes first-person simulator, where you fly through the jungles of South America chasing the target you need to destroy while fighting the drug baron's mercenary forces. How you do in one will affect how you do in the other.",

This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:   * Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save  Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick  ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling  and a top-down perspective.   * Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of  aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.   * Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you  have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting  gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.   * The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons  with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect  speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.",

The game includes all 16 international GP circuits of 1991. Players may drive them in quick race mode, single race or a full championship. The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn't include real names. It is possible to edit and save team and driver names by hand. The extensive tuning feature influences the performance of the car. In-race setup allows players to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the pit box. Six optional driving aids help F1 rookies finish their race: players can toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructibility to improve their driving. A replay system allows players to watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side camera footage. The game features 3D graphics and various details and effects such as working rear mirrors, collisions with flying debris, crude damage models (wings are visibly bent after crashes), and wet weather that influences traction, including a fog effect that obscures vision when driving in another car's splash water. While the Amiga version allows multiplayer races in hotseat mode, the PC version originally had solo races only. In 1993, the v1.05 update added modem support and a few other improvements.",

On the way, he is ambushed and abducted by the soldiers of the Austrian duke Leopold. The duke demands a large ransom to be paid in exchange for the king's freedom. However, the king's brother, Prince John, is content with the situation and plotting to take the throne for himself. That is when the legendary Robin Hood, one who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, decides to raise the money needed to liberate the king, with the help of his fellow outlaws of Sherwood Forest. Conquests of the Longbow is an adventure game and a follow-up to Conquests of Camelot. It uses an icon-based interface common to most contemporary Sierra adventures. Like its spiritual predecessor, it differs from most other games in the genre by reducing traditional inventory-based puzzles in favor of exploration and varied tasks dictated by the situation at hand. These include talking to characters, gathering information, making decisions, solving riddles, or participating in mini-games such as combat, archery contest, and Nine Men's Morris (with adjustable difficulty). The game is divided into days; each day is completed when certain tasks have been fulfilled. It is, however, possible to fail some of those tasks and still advance the plot. Several situations can be handled in different ways. The player's decisions affect Robin Hood's ranking towards the end of the game. Number of points scored, the amount of money collected for the ransom, and the fate of Robin's fellow outlaws are considered when awarding the rank. Depending on these factors the player reaches one of the four possible endings, ranging from Robin getting hanged to a happy conclusion of his love life.",

The game also is one of the first text adventures implemented completely using DOS batch files. You enter your commands at the trusty \"C:\\>\" DOS prompt. Each verb corresponds to a batch file with objects passed as arguments, and the game's state is stored in environment variables. Even saving and restoring works this way. Entering \"DIR *.BAT /W\" gives you a list of available commands, and you can also add the game directory to the DOS PATH environment variable, making the game a part of the DOS operation system, just like PING or FORMAT... The game starts with you, Bilbo, sitting in his cozy little hobbit cave together with his pals Gandalf and Thorin. You'll soon find out that not everything is as you might remember it from the book: Gandalf seems to be working on a strange spell that involves exploding hobbits, while Thorin has turned into a drug addict hippie, judging from his answer, some serious with personal problems. Although the game has but seven rooms, it gives you the occasion to retrace all the memorable scenes of the book -- together with psychotic Thorin, you'll be dealing with stoned trolls, goof off at Elrond's Last Homely Home and, ultimately, enter Smaug's fabulous cave. The 2001 \"redux Director's Cut\" edition introduces some completely new content involving Thorin and a naked dwarf woman that won't be disclosed here for the sake of our innocent youth. It also improved compatibility for Win32.",

There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy. Players start by choosing two students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as \"OPEN Door\"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.",

The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways. The FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.",

Catacomb 3-D is a simple fantasy first-person shooter game. To get to Grelminar, you have to complete several maze-like levels. Your sole weapon is a fireball spell, which can be used an unlimited number of times and can be charged up to cause more damage. You can also find one-time use items: bolts and nukes. A bolt launches several fireballs in a machine-gun fashion, while a nuke launches a ring of fireballs in all directions. The various enemies (such as orcs or trolls) that you meet while exploring are the main target for those fireballs. However, you can also destroy whole sections of walls, which is often necessary to complete the level. Items you can find include (apart from bolts and nukes) healing potions, keys to open doors, and scrolls that provide hints. There isn't an overhead map in the game, but you have a compass to guide you. What's more, various areas of the map have specific names displayed at the bottom of the screen, making it a bit easier to navigate.",

You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them.

These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse. The second in the Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the AD&D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview \"world map\" that allows instant traveling between cities.",

Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also \"bump\" any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them. Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence. When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier. Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back. Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.",

The objective is to reach the exit, which is only opened when a certain number of Infotrons are collected (usually all in the level). The setting is inside of a computer, therefore some computer terminology describes elements found in the levels. This includes destructible RAM chips, indestructible hardware, utility disks (which are explosives), terminals, and ports (one or two way gates). The most common enemy is a zonk, a rock which falls and rolls downwards, and explodes if it comes in contact with some, but not all other game elements. One of the most common enemies are a scissor looking enemy called snik snak which always moves in a predictable pattern. Some levels feature gravity, where Murphy will fall down if he stands still, and has nothing beneath him. Other elements have fixed rules, such as Infotrons and Zonks always falls down, while RAM and hardware always stays put. There are 111 levels in total, and up to three of these may temporarily be skipped to advance. The game allows several profiles so that players may use the same computer with their own progression.",

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at. Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps. You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you. There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game. As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.",

Each player's performance is rated out of 10 and these are among the many statistics stored throughout the game. The game features all the most important British competitions, and the database 80 league teams (each with complete squads) and 380 non-league and European teams (who you will sometimes play against, but can not purchase their players - buying overseas players is dealt with elsewhere). There are 1,500 players featured, each rated on attributes such as passing, tackling and creativity, and with details such as age and nationality also stored, and 650 managers, coaches, scouts, and physios. Between matches you can purchase or sell your players and trim your squad to suit your needs. When you approach a player, and both the club and player are interested, you put in an offer and see if the club accepts it - they may request an increase. The player will have demands for contract length and wage, before a deal can be completed. The game follows the season by splitting each week into weekday and weekend, each of which may or may not include a match. After you have done everything you press Done and the game progresses in time.",

However, if you choose to play with only one player/knight, the other three will be the computer rivals. Wandering through the map, you can visit enchanted places, towns where you can buy equipment or try your luck in gambling, but mostly visited places on the map will be cabins which represents the places where certain enemy beasts are. Each spot has about two or more beasts which after defeating them can be rewarding in a certain way, depending on game's randomize placement. Also, for example, if the place has three beasts and you kill two before you die, next time you (or some other player) go back there, there'll be only one beast left to fight. It's also possible for two players to run into each other and, once defeating the other, the one who prevails can steal the other player's money and/or weapons. Thus, searching for the moonstone begins, but that's only half of the story. The rest unfolds once you find it.",

The player character starts on the upper-most level and slowly makes his way downwards. The game uses ASCII characters to represent locations, items, monsters, and the protagonist himself. There are twenty-six different types of monsters, symbolized by their initial letters (e.g. L for Leprechaun). Monsters have different abilities and modes of attack. The dungeon and the items in it are randomly generated each time the player begins a new game. Each dungeon level contains a grid of three by three rooms and dead ends. Levels get progressively more complex and maze-like, and monsters grow in strength the deeper the hero ventures into the dungeon. The player character can acquire better weapons and armor, gain experience points and level up. Should the protagonist perish in the dungeon, the player must restart the game anew.",

It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on. These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework. Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life. The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.",

At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!).

                "plot": "Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc. The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police. Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).",

The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II. It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes. You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane. The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.",

Combat and magic happen in real time, similarly to Dungeon Master. There is a variety of monsters to fight and spells to cast. The game features a point-and-click interface for fighting, spellcasting and handling objects.",

One thing that makes Pacific Strike unique is that rather than a simple retelling of historical battles, the course of World War II is affected by the player. Failing to destroy particular targets will ensure that they remain problems in future missions, and doing extremely well will allow the allies to be more successful. Thus regardless of the actual course of the war, events unfold. For this reason it's possible to can end the war prematurely before Hiroshima was bombed or end up in a situation where American forces surrender to the Japanese.",

The keys are hidden somewhere behind an object on each level of the mountain. To find out what is behind an object you need to use one of your magic coins. However, the number of coins you have is limited and there are many places to search so you first need to find clues as to where keys (and treasures!) are located. Wandering about the mountain are numerous elves; if you catch a scroll carrying elf in your net, he'll ask a question. A correct answer will provide a clue. After reaching the top of the multi-leveled mountain, all the treasures you collected along the way will be put back in the treasure chest, and you begin again at the bottom with a tougher difficulty level. After all treasures have been brought to the top, you can find the crown and win the game!",

Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town... Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.",

It is up to the private investigator JR Knight and his lovely companion Faythe to find out what is going on. Cobra Mission is based on an earlier release of the same name, but was developed from scratch and has many important differences that make it an independent title rather than a port. Many locations and characters were completely re-designed, and story events added or altered. There are also more different enemy types and many more items to find in this version. Like the original game, it is a Japanese anime-style RPG with erotic content. The game takes place in Cobra City, a large town divided into several parts. The player navigates the characters through the city in top-down view, visiting various buildings, talking to people, buying weapons and items, gathering information, and fighting random enemies. During battles, the game switches to first-person perspective. Both JR and Faythe can be controlled as a party. Unlike the earlier version, the battles are not turn-based. The player must click on the picture of the enemy in real time to inflict damage. The mouse cursor is always slightly moving during battles, which makes aiming more difficult. Many enemies have weak and strong areas, and it is necessary to aim precisely in order to have success. Following completion of major quests, the protagonist rescues young women who become grateful, giving him their telephone numbers. It is then possible to visit them and participate in erotic mini-games: The player is given a certain number of turns, during which he has to perform the correct actions to seduce the girl successfully.",

The game can be played from a more traditional overhead-view mode, which makes it easier to tell where the bumpers are in relation to the flippers, and is recommended for learning the game. Most of those bumpers are single-colour and arranged in a straightforward pattern. There are three different gameplay speeds and 2 possible levels of ball bounce.",

The event is simulated here using 3D polygon graphics to recreate the 33 cars in the race. Players are able to choose their car and customize it with a variety of options. Modifications include wing down-force, tire pressures, wheel stagger (making the right-side wheels larger, to compensate for the banked corners) and turbo output (which provides boost, but stresses the engine and uses more fuel). After qualifying (by performing during four laps and taking the average) players can race over 10, 30, 60 or the full 200 laps. Lower modes remove car damage and the 'full-course yellow' system, the absence of these can make for repeat carnage including traffic collisions and huge pile-ups.",

But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. A thousand years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists? Starflight is a space exploration game with role-playing elements. The game is completely non-linear, allowing the player to venture to any star system and explore any of the vast amount of available planets. The main plot is advanced by following cryptic clues either received as transmissions at the initial spaceport, or obtained as a result of successful communication with various alien races populating the universe. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Besides the captain of the ship, a science officer, a navigator, an engineer, a communicator, and a doctor have to be assigned to the ship. The player can choose between Humans, Velox, Thrynn, Elowan, and Android races when creating the characters. Each profession usually has a racial counterpart with the highest proficiency in it. Except Androids, members of every race can be trained in their skills by spending the game's currency. In the starting location the player can also acquire better weapons, armor, and shields for the ship, as well as outfit it with cargo pods. Terrain vehicle can be customized as well. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Planets may be inhospitable, with harsh weather conditions and various terrain types. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can be sold for MU, the game's currency. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to approach them diplomatically or face them in combat. Depending on the communicator's skill, the player may conduct successful conversations by assuming different postures, requesting information, or answering questions posed by the aliens. Each race has a different attitude and requires different approaches to peacefully end the negotiations. If all else fails, or if the player so wishes, the player-controlled ship may engage the aliens in combat, which is presented as overhead arcade action sequences. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire. The Amiga version adds an auto-mining command. The Genesis version has updated graphics and sound, and is different in several aspects: locations of minerals and artifacts are different; there are new weapons for the ship and upgrades for the terrain vehicle; landing on planets is no longer automatic and must be controlled manually to avoid crashing; terrain vehicle exploration is more realistic, with visible weather conditions and various terrain types slowing down the vehicle.",

In this side-scrolling action game you run through a huge mansion with many different levels, battling all kinds of monsters and collecting items (mostly bonus points). Every so-and-so points you get an additional life, and every so-and-so levels you combat a boss. One of the things that make this game unique is that instead of just having a limited amount of ammunition, you have a shotgun and can shoot 8 bullets at any given time. However, you must wait in order for Dave to reload his gun. Another thing that sets the game apart is the ability to aim your gun in several angles (generally: up, down or straight ahead).",

His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races. Ultima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no \"world map\" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved. The interface has been re-designed, the original key-bound commands co-existing with selectable command icons and mouse-based interaction. The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters. The player is also able to conduct extensive conversations with the Avatar's companions, as well as split the party and control the characters separately. Some important topics may be highlighted during text display, to facilitate further dialogue, which requires the player to type the desired conversation topics. Like in the predecessors, the player is free to explore the game world from the beginning of the game, and visit locations in any order. Following the main quest and obtaining specific items and information is necessary to complete the story; however, the player can also opt to bypass a large part of it by using previous knowledge of the game or outside help. The FM Towns version has full voice acting for all the conversations, in English and in Japanese.",

                "plot": "An updated version of White Wolf's earlier Empire game, which was based on a wargame dating back to early mainframe days. One to six players (human or computer with three levels of intelligence) compete to conquer the world using their ground, air, and sea units. There are three versions of the game available: basic, standard, and advanced. The basic game provides the minimal types of units, a completely viewable map, and basic production rules. The standard game adds some new units, forces you to explore the map to view it, and slightly modifies the production rules. Finally, the advanced game (for the true wargamer) adds even more types of units, terrain effects on movement and sighting, and slightly more complicated production rules. In addition to playing one or more people around the same computer, you could play via mail (by posting disks back and forth), e-mail, modem, network, or direct serial link. The game also came with some preset scenarios and maps for players to use. Additionally, there was an editor that let players create their own maps and scenarios. Copy protection was a compromise between security and player convenience. Rather than looking up a word in the manual every time the game was run, this was only required when running the separate executable that set game options. (Screen resolution, sound options, etc.) Naturally, you always had to run it before playing the first time. White Wolf and New World Computing also released a scenario disk for the game and later released the Windows version with the extra scenarios on CD-ROM.",

                "plot": "Suburban Commando is a mix of space shooter, jump-and-run and beat-em-up. If you're a US American, the mention of the name Hulk Hogan will most likely make some tears sparkle in your eyes, while your reminisce about the good old days when the Hulkster single-handedly beat up all those jerks in the WWF. If you know Hogan only from his movies, you'll have a different reason for crying. One of the films featuring Hulk was called Suburban Commando (1991). Alternative Software turned it into a game two years later, and decided to create a wild mix of space shooter, platform jumping and - of course - beat-em-up action. Loosely following the storyline of the film, Hogan alias intergalactic hero Shep Ramsey travels through space, crash-lands on earth and beats up the bad guys. The first level is a R-Type-like horizontal space shooter; destroy formations of drones and collect weapon upgrades. After that, you'll enter three platform levels, in which you have to find nine items each. Avoid being shot and dispatch the enemies with kicks and jumps. After each mission, you'll encounter the level boss, who you're supposed to beat up in a Street Fighter clone. Apart from a comic-style likeness of Hulk Hogan as the main hero (with a huge head and tiny body -- strange), the game has little reference to the movie. No other main characters appear. Fans of the film will especially mourn the complete absence of any mimics. If you're curious for more information about the movie, check the trivia and links sections.",

As Taradino Cassatt, member of the High-risk United Nations Taskforce (HUNT), the player must infiltrate the stronghold that El Oscuro's followers have established on a small island in the Gulf of Santa Catalina, and shut down their operations. As the shareware episode was meant to showcase the various features of the full game, some of the enemies and obstacles encountered in The HUNT Begins actually only make their first appearance in episodes two and three of the Dark War. That way, the shareware version allows to sample a substantial portion of the game's arsenal, enemy roster, items, traps and other obstacles. The HUNT Begins contains a total of ten single-player levels (seven regular levels, one secret level and two \"warp-only levels\" which can be accessed only with the use of the level warp cheat), and additionally there are eight levels designed for online play. Three multi-player (Comm-Bat) modes are available in the shareware version: Normal, Score Mode, and Collector, and it is possible to play in these modes not only against the shareware version owners but also against opponents who have Dark War.",

Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi. Space Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode. Interstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first. It is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others. When docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.",

The party must find the origin of these nightmarish undead creatures and eliminate it in order to save Krynn from turning into a land of undead. Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the \"Knight\" class, unavailable in AD&D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 \"clans\" to focus more on a different type of fighting style. Adventuring consists of either overland map travel or the standard 1st person town adventure. The player's party consists of 6 characters (of which one must be a Knight) as well as possible NPC characters joining your party. Wandering monsters will of course attack the party on occasion so gear up and prepare for undead monster-bashing combat!",

As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:  1. Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children  that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb  ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against  attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing  Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all  children.  2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks  while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks & guards  in carts and safely reach the end of the track.  3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone  while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for  that lava.  With every cycle the mine & mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.",

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition. While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?",

Beware: eight levels of traps and deadly enemies await. The Immortal is an isometric game with puzzle-solving and action combat. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, the game offers a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friendly characters may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.",

It is essentially a bitmapped \"rail-shooter\", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to \"pick them up\". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.",

As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses. You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents. The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important. A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.",

GAMEPLAY Your helicopter is a fast gunship capable of quick maneuvers (left, up, down, right) and also equipped with a chain-gun (simply put, it can shoot). Your helicopter can also change directions by pressing the CTRL button, which is especially useful if you want to aim at ground targets. As mentioned, your primary objective is to rescue those helpless civilians running around on the ground. To do so, you must carefully land your chopper on the ground and wait them to board your helicopter. Enemy hostiles may attempt to thrawt your rescue attempts while possibly also killing those civilians. Killed civilians will cause a negative score (indicated by the score board) while rescued civilians will be indicated by a positive score.",

One night, a spaceship crash-lands in the small town of Atom City, Nevada, home to a military base and a nuclear power plant. The alien Barth, a self-described \"Pulsating Inconvenience\" from Planet X, brings terrible news to the people of Earth: the Goddesses have conquered Planet X and forced its denizens to become sex slaves. Gas Pump Girls is the sequel to Leather Goddesses of Phobos. The player can choose between three different protagonists: the alien Barth, the gas station owner Zeke, or Lydia, the daughter of the astronomer who discovered Planet X. Barth's scenario involves different tasks, while the humans' gameplay is largely identical, with the exception of different dialogues. Unlike the previous game, the sequel is a graphical adventure without any text input. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion, with a \"smart cursor\" that automatically changes its shape depending on the possible action that can be executed with a person or an object. The game has multiple-choice conversations, many of which are optional.",

Larry Laffer has finally found the woman of his dreams, and can happily live with her together on the beautiful tropical island... until he gets thrown out of the house by his wife. His boss, who happens to be his (now ex-) father-in-law, fires him. Larry is all alone, without a woman, without a job, on an island that has long ceased to be a \"tropical paradise\" and is exploited by entertainers, lawyers, and alike. But never despair! Dressed in his irresistible leisure suit, Larry is about to conquer the world (or at least its female population) anew. Watch out, fairer sex, because Larry is back to his swinging self! The game uses the same text-based interface and the same graphical engine as the previous entry in the series. The structure of the game, however, is more similar to that of the first installment: most of the time, the player is confined to one large area which can be freely explored. Unlike the two previous Larry games, the player does not just control Larry, but also - in the second half of the game - the enigmatic and beautiful pianist Patti, helping them to reach an ending that will finally bring happiness into Larry's life.",

In one-player mode you have four characters to choose from - brothers Dan and Nik play identically, Lo-Ray is a Buddhist Monk, and Junior a failed boxer. The opponents include a Ninja warrior, a businessman whose post-fight catchphrase is 'I'm sorry about that', and a thin Spanish girl. The backdrops feature lots of color and animation, varying from wrestling rings to building sites and beaches. The control is designed around one-button controllers, with special moves generated by pushing in a certain direction and pressing fire, and one 'super special' move by holding fire for a few seconds. The real skill is in combining these moves effectively.",

                "plot": "The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from athletics to cycling. The events are:   * Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate  through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real  event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the  margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a  direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the  one with the fastest time after penalty time is added   * Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows.  By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic  crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.   * 400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing  the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming  the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few  tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending  the event   * High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player  starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button  to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action  button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to  pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at  an height, or the maximum height is cleared.   * Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the  horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls.  While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse  refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too  late) the competition ends immediately.   * Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to  launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed  must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the  action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the  angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an  angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is  released as well   * Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of  laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as  possible to the inner edge without falling.  Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.",

Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons. The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms. When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you. The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard). Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.",

When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world. In comparison to the better known console version this game is a traditional fighting game similar to Double Dragon in which the player walks from left to right while battling numerous enemies. Only if all foes are dispatched of, the player can advance in the level. It's also possible to perform special attacks and use weapons. The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental objects like phone boots. Ryu can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units. The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.",

                "plot": "Metropolis was founded in 2213 A.D. by the United Stellar Council as the capital city of the planet XK-120, a mining planet and center of learning throughout the galaxy. That was the past. In 2315 A.D., Metropolis is invaded by the Tzorg. The new conquerer leave the planet but install a Robot Patrol System to keep the locals in check. Now the only resistance against the Tzorg occupation is a small group of resistance fighters of the Underground network. In the year 2400 A.D. the final hope to overthrow Tzorg rule over the city is to infiltrate the Tzorg Authority Complex through a recently discovered secret route, access the terminals, and shut down the robots; that is, if they had a computer specialist. That's where the protagonist comes in. As part of yet another shipment of miners from other conquered Tzorg lands to replace the 'disappearances' of past workers, the hero has been contacted by the Underground to join their struggle against the Tzorg. The contact leaves instructions: find Spider, contact the Underground, good-bye and good luck. 2400 A.D. is a top-down role-playing game that has similarities to Ultima games, though with simpler gameplay mechanics. The city of Metropolis is divided into five areas: Center, North, South, East, West. All of which are indicated by borders, guarded and patrol by different kinds of robots. Non-player characters also frequent the city. An attempt to communicate with them will open dialog boxes, where the player must type in keywords for further information. Exploration and transportation may be conducted via three approaches: walking, using the \"slidewalk\" (automated sidewalk), or by using subway system. The city contains a few merchants where the player may purchase some items. More curious items such as weapons and personal devices, however, are rumored to be sold by the Underground. Throughout the city, there are also power nodes, which allow the player to recharge weapons and other devices. Use of these power nodes are illegal by the Tzorg Authority, prompting a possible robot dispatch to the area, or if any robots are in the immediate vicinity, to attack the character. The main character has four primary attributes: Energy (equivalent to hit points and strength combined), Dexterity, IQ, and Affinity. During character creation, the player may allocate 99 points among these attributes. These attributes will increase during gameplay when the character performs certain actions. Affinity, for example, may increase when the character talks to NPCs. Combat initiates when the player character attacks or is attacked by an enemy robot. Before engaging in combat, the hero must first equip a ranged weapon in the inventory (a maximum of eight items) and recharge the weapon. The character cannot attack if no charged weapon is equipped. Combat flows in real time, pausing when the player selects an attack. The protagonist may only shoot in a diagonal or vertical direction, while robots have the advantage to attack in all nine directions. If the character is hit, all attributes will be decreased. The attributes will return to their original scores over time. If the protagonist succeeds in defeating a robot, he may search the remains and obtain money. Defeat will result in imprisonment and confiscation of items at the Rehabilitation Center, where the protagonist must also register regularly to avoid being thrown into prison. Robots will re-spawn after a certain amount of time.",

Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process. The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.",

Using the mouse as controller and its cursor as your powerful finger, you must build your skills not only as the leader of a Campaign Army but also skillfully manage the infrastructure of your kingdom. There are two game scenarios:  1. Against up to six human opponents. The scenario is based upon each  player's ability to build his Kingdom into a society, which must  prosper to enable the player to create the wealth to expand the  growth required to increase the size and strength of his army,  which will enable him to strategically conquer his opponents  territory in his quest to become King of England.  2. Head-to-head against computer opponents. In this scenario the human  player must gain the skills as outlined in scenario one, but he is  pitched against Vikings War Lords (up to five) who play by  different rules, their aim is to gain wealth by conquest with no  thought of development. They act as barbarians. It is up to human  players to use the more constructive approach to outwit the  computer player.",

In each level, Barbie starts by going left to right with forced scrolling. She has a default speed and can speed up as well. She must avoid moving obstacles by moving up and down and controlling her speed. If she hits one, she loses a chance and it's game over if she runs out of chances. She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances. There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot. You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level. You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit. You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these. You are awarded points for each correct match. When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice. This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one. Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left. On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up. This brings you to another magazine cover. You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover. Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct. When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were given earlier. You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move. Barbie then continues to the next level. There are a total of four: Barbie driving down the street, skating on the beach, walking through a ski resort and walking through the park.",

Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain. The only problem? At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission. As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance. Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present. You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier. From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it. The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs. An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile. Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.",

Between voyages, you'll have to buy and outfit ships and hire men to crew them. As in the original 7COG, you can play at three different skill levels, and choose to explore either the historical map (consisting of the Americas at the time of Columbus' journeys) or a land form randomly generated by the game. As befitting a \"Commemorative Edition,\" the PC version of 7COG has been beefed up with hi-res graphics and digitized sound. 7COG is a rare example of a game being completely redeveloped for a specific platform instead of merely being ported over. (However, Seven Cities of Gold did in fact come out natively for the PC in the mid 1980s. --Ed.)",

The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded \"unbeatable\"(?) pterodactyl. The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.",

Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon is, like its predecessor, a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game based on the second edition of AD&D rules. It uses the same point-and-click gameplay mechanics and controls as the first game, with only minor changes. The game is set entirely in pseudo-3D maze-like areas; no automapping is available. Combat flows in real time, and characters can move as a single unit to lure enemies or avoid blows. A starting party consists of four characters, which can be transferred from the earlier game or created from scratch. Six classes (Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Mage, and Thief) are available. Characters can reach higher levels and learn new spells, must face new and tough monsters, and solve multiple puzzles. Compared to the first game, many more illustrated NPC encounters and cutscenes were added.",

The opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, the opponents will deliver a taunt, which the player must respond to as creatively as possible. The game is viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. The player's aim is to pin the opponent to the ground for three seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin. Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, the player can waggle the joystick to ensure he wins the grapple.",

On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.",

Can you alter the outcome of WWII with them? The experimental German planes include Messerschmitt 262, Me163 Komet rocket plane, and the Gotha \"flying wing\". You can also fly the traditional ME109 or FW190 piston engine aircraft. As for the American side, you can take to the skies in the P-51 Mustang, P-47 Thunderbolt, or the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. In the B-17, you can not only control the plane itself, but also the gun turrets and the bombing sight. Next to training missions for each aircraft, there are several historical missions available, recreating real air encounters of the war. The Tour of Duty mode allows you to take your pilot through a set number of missions, gaining promotions and medals, with the ultimate goal of surviving the tour. Finally, there's the strategic campaign mode where you can fight the whole war from either side, both planning and flying missions. As the Americans, the objective is to cripple Germany's industry through strategic bombardment. As the Germans, you have to survive by keeping the industry alive. As time passes, new aircraft become available, in accordance with history. For instance, the Mustang was not deployed until late 1943. For the German side, the jet and rocket aircraft have to be researched before they can be built. The German side can also build V1 and V2 missiles. Another option is to let industrial branches work in secret to hinder the American bombing efforts. Other interesting features are a mission editor and a film playback option.",

The sole purpose for this organization's existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means helping the current Prime Minister keep ahead of his competition in the polls. Floor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister's polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or even the player's continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives. During the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film \"Capricorn One\"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13. The Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting people's homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these \"black hat\" activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain \"Mr. Garcia\" (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).",

                "plot": "Three Rings for the-Elven kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their hall of stone, Nine for mortal men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his throne In the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. September 23, 1418 s.r. Frodo Baggins receives a letter from Gandalf the Grey, telling him to leave at once for Rivendell and to keep an eye out for a friend on the road by the name of Strider. He also warns that the servants of the Enemy are in pursuit and have taken the guise of riders in black. J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth is the 16-bit game with additional adventuring features compared to the 8-bit version, loosely depicting the events of the One Ring from the Shire to Mt. Doom. The game starts with the three hobbits: Frodo, Sam, and Pippin surrounded by nine individual units of Nazgul near the Shire. Although the first task is to travel to Rivendell, the player is free to decide how heroes and armies progress, despite the in-game conventional storyline. Victory is attained by successfully sending the ring bearer to Mt. Doom - how this accomplished is completely up to the player. Additionally, any hero including Frodo may die during combat. If the ring bearer dies during combat, a new ring bearer (if they survive the encounter) will be appointed to carry the One Ring. If the enemy gains possession of the One Ring is taken by the enemy, they will attempt to reach Barad-Dur, Sauron's fortress in the heart of Mordor, which will result in the player's defeat. The player will also lose if the enemy manages to seize three major allied citadels. Gameplay is divided in accordance to the three different map levels used: Full Map Level Consists of the whole map of Middle Earth on one screen. All heroes and armies will be shown as colored dots; blue as allied units, green as neutral units, and red as enemy units, as well as general terrain and regional displays. All forces are in the game are viewable as no fog of war feature is in effect. Campaign Level Most gameplay features of the war takes place at this level. This map offers more detail of locations and units; all locations such as towns, citadels, ruins, etc., may be viewed from here; characters are displayed as figured and armies as badges. Large armies will be shown as a shield, indicating the unit type as well as the shield background signifying the unit's country of origin. Although at the start of the game various character and armies are viewable across the map, only flashing units may be issued orders by the player. Combat encounters for armies also commence at this level, which will prompt a new window where the player may opt to enter a battle or ignore the event. Combat orders consist of four commands: charge, engage, withdraw, and retreat. The battle when all units of either side is completely destroyed or retreats. Animation Level Animated encounters for characters take place at the level, either for story or combat-related events. Random encounters will prompt a window to be opened and the player may opt to go there or ignore the event. Objects, such as armor, weapons, and other equipment are also viewable and may only be manipulated at this level (e.g. equip, use, etc.). Some units of the West require certain items before their units may be mobilized.",

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished. Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty. Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".",

Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has \"key players\", such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.",

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding. There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible. Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.",

Connect via the GEnie network or fly head-2-head against a friend at modem speeds as low as 1200 baud. If you played via GEnie network, the battles could contain up to 50 people from all over America at the same time. Each plane has unique features in regards to performance, maneuverability, and flight control characteristics. Using the keyboard control help-screen (brought up with the F10 key) during flight helps reduce the learning curve. Chat communication in real-time air battles is limited to keyboard text, which makes quick abbreviated responses a necessity.

The sequel features six towns as opposed to the predecessor's only one, and a larger overworld area. Dungeons contain more traps and puzzles than before. The player can create a party of up to seven active characters, as well as create additional characters and store them at the Adventurer's Guild in every city. Available races are human, elf, dwarf, hobbit, half-elf, half-orc, and gnome. In addition, some monsters can join the party and be summoned during combat. It is also possible to store money and banks and gamble in the casino, though the latter feature has been removed from the PC version.",

Other than scouts (which are the least powerful) the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can't be moved during the game, so watch out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your goal. When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit them.

However in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny he was outgunned and Freddy had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Coarsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers. Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click adventure game bearing many similarities to other Sierra titles in the same genre, in particular Leisure Suit Larry series. Players use the command bar at the top of the screen to choose a verb command that is combined with locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up. Like other Sierra games, successful actions add to the player's score, judging the player on 1000 points.",

The original arcade version of \"Double Dragon II\" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, \"Double Dragon II\" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire. The Game Boy version of \"Double Dragon II\" is an English localization of a \"Kunio-kun\" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired \"Renegade\" and \"River City Ransom\" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.",

You can return to your mother ship and trade your scavenged fuel for additional supplies. (Your mother-ship docking tractor beam can also be used to capture earthly aircraft... hmmm...) The controls are akin to (but different from) a helicopter's. You can control the amount of anti-gravity; you can pitch, roll, and yaw; you can thrust back and forth, up and down, and side to side. (Thrusting up and down is preferable to the less precise use of antigravity - important while docking.) For advanced flying, it is possible to use anti-laminar transducers to completely eliminate drag (important to keep your hull from overheating), and use the aforementioned gluon devices to \"fly\" forwards (But watch out for spinout!) There are other options available, including landing pods, illuminator beams, probes, gravitons, shields, teleportation. UFO is also compatible with the subLogic Scenery Disks.",

Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back. It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.",

                "plot": "The year is 1925. Laura Bow is a young student attending the Tulane University in New Orleans, and an aspiring journalist. Her friend Lillian invites her to spend a weekend in a mansion belonging to her uncle, Colonel Henri Dijon, a veteran of Spanish-American war and the owner of a large, but decaying sugar plantation on a secluded island. During the dinner Laura meets members of Lillian's extended family and their alleged friends. As Laura begins to explore the mansion and talk to its inhabitants, she unravels old family feuds and realizes some of those people - if not all - have their own plans and schemes. It all gets much worse when strange accidents and murders start to occur. Laura must investigate those gruesome events and find the culprit. The Colonel's Bequest is a detective mystery adventure game very similar in style and presentation to Agatha Christie's novels. The game world is confined to the island and consists of numerous interconnected areas, such as various rooms in the mansion, garden, smaller structures, etc. The player is free to explore much of the game's world right from the beginning, with only a few areas being initially inaccessible. The game's clock advances a quarter of an hour each time Laura performs an action pertaining to the plot. Characters have their own schedules and clues are often obtained by discretely observing their actions. The player interacts with the environment by typing verb-object command combinations (such as \"Look Garden\", \"Talk Colonel\", etc.). Some of the most common actions have keyboard shortcuts. The gameplay largely focuses on exploration. Much of the plot stays in the background and can be uncovered by talking to the characters about various topics (mostly other people). There is an inventory and a few puzzles, but they play a much less prominent role in the game compared to other adventures by Sierra. It is possible to complete the game without having discovered the entire plot or even without having identified the murderer. There is no scoring system, but after the game is finished the player is given a detective ranking and told about story branches or other elements he might have missed.",

                "plot": "The Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings. The game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player. Gameplay is represented in two major areas:   * The first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes  geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here  the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also  command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a  real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to  make battle plans easier.   * The second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight  another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14  soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and  will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g.  attack, forward, retreat, etc.).  The difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy. The game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.",

Your goal is to set things straight by locating missing items for each of the fairy tale characters in the land. When wandering around the land you can talk to the different characters (each from a different nursery rhyme) to find out what item it is they need; for example, Little Bo Peep is looking for her sheep and Jack Be Nimble lost his candle stick. The items are scattered about the land, and when you locate one pick it up and return it to the appropriate character. When successful, the complete nursery rhyme will play with the lyrics appearing on screen. You can only carry one item at a time, so you may need to remember where you spotted or dropped items not being carried! Also, each time the game is played objects will be in a new location. Included with the game is a map of Mother Goose Land which may help you locate the different fairy tale characters.",

Eventually he meets the leader of the resistance, John Connor, and the young Kyle Reese, who send him on missions which are vital for humanity's survival.

It seems that Skynet has perfected its technique of time manipulation, and the hero must travel in time to stop it. Terminator: Future Shock is a first-person shooter based on the Terminator movie series.

The game has an evolving story and missions with a military feel, including briefings in which it is possible to talk to several people and gather info. There are seventeen different weapons available. It is often necessary to navigate hazardous terrain, avoiding the effects of radiation. The protagonist can move on foot, or navigate vehicles such as a jeep with mounted weapons, or an aerial combat robot. There is no multiplayer component in the game.",

If at least one layer is completely filled it vanishes and rewards points - more layers at the same moment means more points.

Your weaponry starts out with a bootspoon (which can be upgraded to a Super Bootspork) and a small Zorcher (which uses Zorch energy). The Zorcher can, of course, be upgraded to frightening levels... Zorch is apparently an interdimensional substance, because enough of it can \"send a Flemoid back to his homeworld.\" You can strap on armor, of course- the armor is a Chex kibble (or a Super Chex kibble). This will protect you from the mucous that the Flemoids snort at you. The opening contains a notice to concerned parents, avowing that the game is non-violent; to keep childrens' interest, the violence was replaced with (and they tried to be delicate here) gross booger sounds. Your character never \"dies\", but becomes immobilized by being covered from head to toe in mucous. Healthy eating habits are also supposedly reinforced- health is regained by eating a bowl of fruit (10% energy), bowl of vegetables (25%), a glass of water (5%), or... yes... \"a complete breakfast\", featuring a bowl of cereal (presumably Chex), toast, glass of milk, and a piece of fruit, for a complete health boost.",

The game offers 32 levels, once you completed a level, you get the level code for the next, so you can skip levels the next time you play. Once you started a level, you have 3 minutes time to collect the amount of diamonds needed to complete the level. At the time you've done this, the exit is accessible and you can leave the level, but you can still collect the rest of the diamonds. You get 10 points per diamond, but only 1 point per second from the time from the 3 minutes you have spared when you exit fast enough. So for highscore purpose, it's good to collect most (or all) diamonds. After you gain a certain amount of points, you gain an extra life. Once you completed level 32, all remaining lives will be added to your score. Make sure, that you don't block your exit with a rock, or that you don't get trapped. If so, your only way to complete the level is by committing suicide and replaying it again. To make your diamond-collecting challenging, there a rock balls in the game. You can stand directly beneath them, but when you move just one square down, the rock will fall, and when you get hit, you're dead. This also happens to falling diamonds. So, if you must go down, move fast, and move then left or right to prevent impact. If it's only one rock, you can move them horizontal, as soon as there is more than one rock, it's impossible to move them further. Sometimes there are not enough diamonds in the game, in this case there are some sieves in the level, where you must put a rock on top of it, and if there is space beneath the sieve, the rock will fall through it, and gets transformed into a diamond. But of course, this is also a good idea to do this, when you already have the certain amount of diamonds to collect. And for a bit more challenge, there are ghosts in some levels, which you must avoid, or they kill you. The good news is, that they don't hunt you, they just follow a patrol route. The bad news is, who knows their route since most of the time, their route is blocked by a diamond or rock, once it's removed, they coming... But you can kill them, if you good enough to let a rock or diamond fall on their head, then they \"explode\" and destroy all 8 squares around them, so make sure, you are not in one of them. But be careful, the explosion will destroy anything, including solid walls, and this may trigger more fallen rocks/diamonds. If you once become tired of the levels, make your own ones, with the included level editor.",

However it isn't long before trouble starts, and an assassination attempt is planned against the Venusian minister.

Players will create (or import) a party of up to six characters and assign statistics, abilities and equipment. Players move their party in a first person maze of corridors, open area and rooms. Certain encounters will allow the player to make choices based on the party skills. In the case of combat, the player and enemy forces each have a turn, controlled on an overhead map.",

Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens. Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction. Other major bonuses found on the floor are emergency kits for restoring your health, and credits. The credits come in handy when you find an Infotex terminal. There, you can access information about your current mission and your vital statistics, as well as buy supplies such as ammunition, weapons and keys. Music is forfeited in this game, in favour of ambience sounds from machinery, machine gun sounds and the sounds of the aliens running around the base.",

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given. The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.",

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down. The Sega Genesis version features \"Original mode\" in which the player participates in racing tournaments, hires mechanics, upgrades his bike. This mode uses passwords allowing players to continue a previously played game.",

The game includes a historical database of ships, display of ships damage status by deck, real time action and instant replay features. There are 3 ways to enjoy the game. The Captain's view puts you on the bridge of one of the great battleships, cruisers or destroyers of the era. Listen to the dramatic sound effects created by the roar of your guns as you fire them. Watch the shells splash in the distance or explode on target. See the flash of enemy guns and feel your ship vibrate as it is hit. Go down below with the damage control parties and attempt to plug the holes before your ship capsizes and sinks. The Fleet view shows an eagle eye perspective of the individual ships in the task force. The Grand Admiral view zooms out even further to give you a strategic map of your entire navy and all visible enemy vessels.",

He is asked to investigate a horrible murder of the mayor's daughter, whose body was mutilated. As Hunter begins to search for clues that would help him solve the crime, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a deadly drug and a powerful criminal syndicate behind it. Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure. There are two side-scrolling action sequences in the game; both can be bypassed without penalty if the player character dies several times in a row. The Sega CD version does not allow the player to skip these sequences. In addition, it uses a different color palette with a greenish tint, and has voice-overs for the dialogues.",

Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out). Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based. Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities. Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.",

                "plot": "Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side. However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc. The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles. Archon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.",

The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth. Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways. The FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.",

There are platforms to land on and recharge and switch weapons and repair the blows the ship has taken. The biggest changes to AUTS are \"flowing\" water, the water remains stationary (as in most games of this genre) but it pushes the ship to a desired direction, so pipe systems can be created. The environment gets destroyed in a neater fashion and the ships don't get stuck so easily into single pixels, and the ships can collide - actually some of the weapons are based on this feature. Other superb features include ejecting a ship, teamplay, altering air viscosity, gravity, etc...",

If you are right, you are taken to the \"Cards\" screen to play a video version of the \"High Low\" card game. Guessing correctly lets you keep control of the board, and the next question. If you lose, your opponent receives the next question. If you win enough times, you'll go to the \"Big Bucks\" card screen where you can bet all or part of your winnings on a more elaborate board of \"High Low\".",

According to legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear. Hitler believes himself to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his brutal army sweeps across Europe. Your mission is to infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler. The loss of his most coveted weapon could push him over the edge. It could also get you ripped to pieces. Spear of Destiny is a prequel to Wolfenstein 3-D. It is a first-person shooter that uses the same engine and has the same gameplay, however the game is not divided into 6 separate episodes - all the levels are one long episode. The enemies and weapons are pretty much the same as in Wolfenstein 3-D. Only new additions include: new bosses, a new type of enemy, and a new pickup (a large box of ammo).",

Too late, and the duck will insult you. Since you can only shoot straight up, this amounts to mentally anticipating how soon the duck will fly directly overhead, and subtracting the time it takes for your bullet to reach the duck's height. Gameplay continues until the hunter runs out of bullets.",

Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before he can discover the Cauldron's location. The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King's Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.",

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.",

As a doll, you'll wake up at the beach, where the bottle from the sea arrives. Reading the message from the bottle and the letter from near post stand, you're informed that you should collect certain items and brew them in a magical cauldron to prepare Fixer Elixir. Drinking it, you will return to your real form in the real world. Items will be given to you, when you complete certain puzzle or challenges. The puzzles are remakes of classic ones and vary from musical sequence repeating to Tangram and Tower of Hanoi. Different inhabitants of the secret island interact with you as well as the image of Dr. Quandary himself keeps an eye on you. Three dolls represent the difficulty levels, which are kept in their names: B. Ginner (beginner), O.D. Nary (ordinary), D. Feecult (difficult).

Pricing games include the Mountain Climbing (in which your 3 guesses must be less than $300 away in total, otherwise a goat will push you over the edge), Safe Cracking (in which you have 3 possibilities for each part of the price, and must correctly guess it) and the Dice Game (in which you accept or reject random rolls to get the real price). There is a persistent Hall of Fame with winners and their scores, and a parser for guessing/bidding prices.

With a back catalog of several installments of the then-leading world atlas and almanac software, PC Globe, the company turned snippets of country-specific info into an educational game that mixed two-player \"Identify that place\" strategy with a \"Get to know the globe\" learning effect - can you say Carmen Sandiego? As the sinister Otto von Slinkenrat tries to pocket the world's treasures in his private collection, renowned adventurer Bush Buck sets out to find and secure the valuable objects for posterity. In a race around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures' whereabouts. Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info - e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. Learning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options - e.g. \"It's an island country\", \"It's in East Asia\" etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward. For each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.",

All four members of the Jetson family have a themed level. The driving sections take place within George's Jetcar, and you must slow down for the speed-limited areas and beware of black holes. At the beginning of the game you are George Jetson, labourer of the Spacely Space Sprockets company in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you to work, but you want to collect money and have a fun. So after the boss ordinary order you can explore the company as usually, collect money bills and useful items, avoiding dangerous robotic mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself. On further levels, other Jetsons family members must do the same things, but at their own locations. Level 2 involves taking Jane out of her booby-trapped home, level 3 sees Judy trying to get a kiss form pop heartthrob Jet Screamer, and finally Elroy is locked in at school and has to escape. You have to activate the items hidden behind the hatches with buttons. These allow you to progress on level, for example, fix an elevator with wrench. Time presses and you have to complete your mission quickly.",

The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command \"Look\" may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.",

It enables you to create your own dinosaurs and then teleport them to different time geological time periods, in quest of hidden dinosaur geneprints. The background story: In the year 2501, the renegade scientist Dr. Max von Fusion has stolen the Designasaurus Research Foundation's prized Gigantodon geneprints and hidden them in different geological time periods, leaving only a poem with some hints about their whereabouts. You play a researcher who goes on the quest for the hidden prints to recreate the fabulous Gigantodon, get millions of credits and get promoted Chief Scientist. The game consists of two parts. First, you select a dinosaur to go exploring with. You can either select a predefined or create your own dinosaur, combining head, body, arms and tails of existing dinosaurs as you want. The combination of parts affects the dinosaurs attributes, like fighting skills or speed. Once you have created a dinosaur and given him a fancy name, you get the opportunity of printing it out before you go exploring. You are now ready for exploration. Select a geological era and a climate and teleport your creature there. You now start the overhead action-adventure part where you have to try to find the Gigantodon's geneprints. Of course, there are other dinosaurs too -- depending on the period and climate. Upon meeting, you can either eat them (if they are small enough), mate with them (if they are of your species and the opposite sex) or fight them. Just like in real life, successful mating is the most complicated, as afterwards you have to defend the eggs and then feed the young. You also have to keep an eye on your hunger, thirst and fatigue, so be sure to eat, drink and rest from time to time. At any time, you can save your game or teleport back to the foundation. This also happens automatically if your dinosaur is badly wounded, so you cannot lose in this game. Finally, you also get dinosaur facts displayed from time to time while exploring. You get points for successful playing, especially for finding parts of the geneprints. Once you have found all parts, you are promoted Chief Scientist and have won the game.",

However, Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps. Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at the protagonist suddenly, unexpectedly and, most of all, often. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause the hero to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. If the player character's torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and the player forgets to light a new one, the protagonist will trip in the dark and break his neck.",

In each chamber you have to collect 6 pieces of an ancient artifact and assemble them like a jigsaw puzzle. The chambers are full of dangerous animals which you have to avoid. There's some food you can collect to regain lost health though. The chambers are also full of puzzles, usually involving manipulation of switches. You have 3 tools with you - a helmet with a headlight, jumping shoes and shields. The helmet emits a beam of light when activated; it is used to solve puzzles that rely on rotating prisms to direct a light beam to a switch. The jumping shoes allow you to, well, jump higher. The shield protects you from enemies for a short time when activated, but you have a limited number of shields and they need to be used wisely.",

In a last attempt to find out what is happening, Starfleet sends in the Enterprise before the Sphere is set up. Its five year mission is to attempt to discover what is causing the defections, and hopefully stop them. If you fail in your mission, the Sphere will be made permanent, if you succeed the Sphere will be dropped, avoiding a potential war with the Romulans. The game is basically a graphical adventure with some real-time combat and piloting. The game progresses by flying to planets, beaming down on them, and retrieving any items you find.

Conan discovers architect of the slaughter was a wizard named Thoth Amon, a high priest of Cult of Set. Sword in hand, vengeance aflame, Conan now travels south in the land of Hyborea to the city of Shadizar. Here his journey of vengeance begins... Conan: The Cimmerian is an action-adventure game with some RPG elements. The game is divided into 3 areas. The first is the overland map, where Conan may travel only between identifiable town and other locations. The second is the town map, here Conan is viewed in a horizontal 3rd Person and the last is the combat screen (or when he enters houses) where Conan is viewed in vertical 3rd Person. Conan may also view his character status and inventory sheet, anytime during the course of the game. Gameplay consists of exploration and combat. The exploration element in the game sets Conan to find his way around towns and hidden locations, often breaking in houses and searching the premises for hidden loot. Towns consist of various places to visit, among others temples which usually offer quests, shops offering weapons and other items, and inns to stay for a health boost. NPC's may be conversed with to seek information, while the tougher-looking types may be provoked into combat. Combat is real-time, one-on-one with Conan on the left and the opponent on the right, consisting of only movement to the left or right and attacking. There are no defensive maneuvers. Both must now keep on attacking until the health bar of either side drops to zero. If Conan wins, he may search the remains and may find loot. At the beginning of the game, Conan may only use one sword style (swing) out of three available sword styles. Additional sword styles may be trained by a sword master.",

You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase. Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples). Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield. Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.",

It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect. Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.",

To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process. The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.",

Apart from watching out for the baby's dropping health (represented as an increasingly tearful face), the baby's diaper gets wetter over time and the thirst increases, too. If the diaper becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, the player immediately loses a life, so collecting fresh bottles and diapers is important.

The protagonist of the game is a rebellious teenager named Namgoong Gunn. On the way to his new school, where he hopes to forget his rather violent past, he spots a beautiful girl, and immediately afterwards his wallet gets stolen. Following the thief, Gunn gets involved in a struggle against a powerful criminal syndicate. The basic gameplay system involves standard combination of punches, kicks, and jumps, in a Final Fight-like fashion. However, the game also has an RPG element in that it awards the protagonist experience points for defeating enemies or even simply harming them. At a level-up screen the player can choose to upgrade Gunn's \"tech\", which allows him to learn new moves such as dashing, grabbing enemies, getting up faster, and others. The player can also choose to upgrade the protagonist's health bar, attack power, and speed.",

The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world. The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.",

Paratroopers are jumping down from those helicopters; if four or more of them touch the ground, they will form a human ladder, climb up to the turret, and destroy it. To avoid that, the player has to shoot either the paratroopers themselves or their parachutes - for different effects but the same results. After the player has withstood several waves of helicopters, bomber planes start appearing. These planes shoot bombs directly at the turret, which do not miss and destroy it right away. To counter that, the player can either eliminate the plane before it has the chance to drop the bomb, or destroy the bomb itself in mid-air. Shooting bombs scores the most points (50). Surviving this stage effectively puts the game on an indefinite loop, with more helicopter and bomber plane stages alternating with increased difficulty. There are no continues and the player has to start over if the turret was destroyed.",

Once the column reaches maximum power the stroke is played. The game also features sound effects, bees randomly buzz, planes and helicopters randomly fly overhead and birds occasionally twitter. The full, registered version, consists of an 18 hole course, hole and course designer software capable of building a course of up to 99 holes, and options to play any hole on any course developed by anyone using a registered version of the game.",

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump. Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him. There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.",

Little did they know that the club was entering an unprecedented run of success that has continued well into the 2010s. The basic control system will be familiar to anyone who's played a Kick Off game, as it involves holding fire to trap the ball under your player's foot, and releasing fire to pass, although the ball will be kicked onwards if it is moving fast when it comes to you. Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones. As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in England's top 5 divisions - all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season. The Tacti-Grid editor allows for advanced match tactics to be configured and experimented with.",

                "plot": "When humans finally managed to colonize the planet Venus, they discovered a gigantic system of artificial underground tunnels there. It is assumed that a highly advanced alien race known as Heechee has constructed those tunnels thousands of years ago. Eventually, an abandoned, yet fully functional Heechee spaceship is discovered. One of the explorers boards it, which leads humanity towards the discovery of a space station with many similar ships - all with coordinates of unknown planets already punched in. This station becomes known as the Gateway, being humanity's only connecting point to the rest of the universe. Since traveling to the potentially dangerous destinations involves a great deal of risk, only some particularly courageous (or perhaps reckless) adventurers, called \"prospectors\", volunteered to go on these journeys. The protagonist of the game is one of those prospectors, having won the membership alongside a small sum of money and a one-way ticket to the Gateway. Eventually, he discovers an ancient device that contain a warning against a mysterious alien species known as Assassins - and the prospector is entrusted with the task of protecting the humans from that threat. Gateway is a text adventure with graphics, based on the Heechee universe books by Frederik Pohl. It is identical in interface and general concept to Legend's other text-driven adventures (such as the Spellcasting series): the player may opt for text-only input as well as selecting verbs from a list. Clicking on objects or characters within the graphical representation of the location provides a text description. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though there are logic-related tasks as well. The player character explores various planets during the course of the journey. In a few cases, it is possible to die in the game.",

Gameplay is similar to normal Pong but with the exception that each Paddle also has a projectile attack that can harm the opponent. First player to 10 points wins the match and will activate the words \"FINISH HIM!\" wherein the player has the chance to enter a command sequence and complete that particular paddle's finishing move... gore and all.

In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep. Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level. The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl. Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.",

The controls are not too complicated: left mouse click to move and right click to fire. When enemies are killed they leave extras behind like ammo, shield energy or money. The money is used to buy upgrades for the combat robot between the 30 missions. The missions have varied tasks, e.g. conquering an enemy base, recovering a new engine or rescuing prisoners. Secondary missions are not mandatory to complete the mission but give useful rewards. Later in the game the player controls up to three robots. The missions are divided in four campaigns which increase in difficulty but can be freely chosen.",

There are hidden treasure troves, teleports and special items to be found as well. Last Knight at Camelot is a side-scrolling platformer somewhat in the tradition of Epic MegaGame's Jill of the Jungle series; the player has no weapons, however, and must either avoid enemies completely or jump on them to defeat them. The keyboard's four arrow keys move the knight left and right, enable him to look up and down, climb up and down, move switches and enter doorways; the shift key makes him jump.",

Inside it bloody bodies are found, and unknown menaces from other worlds and other dimensions try to kill the player. Will you survive the night and save the day? The game is programmed in QBasic (there is even the .bas file inside the game's folder) and the engine is similar to the one used in the Hugo's House of Horror series. The player controls the character with arrow keys and types the desired action using the parser. The game focuses on a morbid atmosphere and on violence with many nasty and gory situations in it. The plot and atmosphere for some ideas are reminiscent of Dark Seed.",

This is played as a beat-'em-up, in which you must beat the opponent dinosaur to win the square. Each dinosaur has it's own strategies, movement restrictions and different combat skills - which are roughly based on the historical properties of the real dinosaurs.

Hired Guns is an action RPG using square-based movements, `a la Dungeon Master, in which up to four players can take part and set in a futuristic setting. The screen is split into 4 parts (or 3 in case 3 players play together), each one representing the viewpoint of the characters, these being selected from a team of 12 available mercenaries. If one player plays alone, he will control all 4 characters, using the mouse to navigate between each character viewpoints. A follow mode is available to avoid tedious numerous amounts of clicking when moving several characters. If two players play together, then each player will use a mouse to control two characters. In three or four-player mode, players can freely choose to control their characters via either a joystick/joypad or some of the predefined keyboard layouts or a mouse. When 4 people play together, the screen will display 4 viewpoints, like in 1 and 2-player modes. In 3-player mode, the top of the screen displays two viewpoints for player 1 and 2, but the lower part of the screen displays a single viewpoint, centered, for player 3. Three game modes are available. The Training mode features 5 simple maps on which the player(s) can learn how to move, use inventory items etc... The Full Campaign mode takes the player(s) to the far reaches of the Luyten planetary system, on the planet Graveyard. Battling through more than 20 theaters of engagement, your team of mercenaries test their limits of military prowess in order to wipe out all threats on the planet surface. To this end, they have to make their way through the different missions and gather 4 fusion power core rings, before entering the final mission in the Spaceport. Finally, in Short Action game mode, the player(s) can choose between 17 maps. On those maps, the player(s) will have to fight some enemies to reach the exit within a specified time limit. Additionally, when more than one player takes part in the mission, players will compete with each other since only the first to reach the exit will win.",

As they fall the blocks can be rotated and steered, in addition the order of the bricks within the blocks can be changed. Blocks fall faster as the player(s) progress through the levels. Other features of this game include difficulty settings, choice of start level, and choice of block set. The shareware version made four single player levels available. The full, registered, version offered a two player mode and \"infinite levels of gameplay\".",

There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. Brutal: Paws of Fury is a one-on-one fighting game across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a \"taunt\" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. The visuals lean towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots. In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.",

To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the \"room\" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.",

Billy the Kid Returns is the story of Billy the Kid, the infamous criminal from the late 19th century. You'll have the chance to play through several crucial moments in his life (and a few made up ones) in hopes of improving upon the Kid's own adventures. The game features ten levels, which range from the Kid's escape from jail, a search for hidden treasure, an ambush by the Apache, a fight against some deadly Senoritas, and his final confrontation against sheriff Pat Garrett. The game has side scrolling, platforming and top-down view stages. At the beginning, you must avoid soldiers and guard dogs, but in later stages you must evade wild animals, other rustlers, gunmen who're after your head for bounty, and snipers hidden in buildings. You only have one way to defend yourself: your gun, which you can use to kill nearly every enemy in the game. You can also pick up other items like apples, stars or tools to raise your score. Picking up cooked meat raises your available lives by one.",

The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.",

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone. Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower. This game was later re-released on the NES with an updated Aladdin cart version. Updates include the number of collectible stars have increased from 100 stars to 250 stars, Dizzy now walks at a brisker pace, there are small terrain differences, some item placements have been rearranged, and the inventory system has become more simplified.",

Stadium improvements (room for more supporters, undersoil heating, a better supporters' club) and sponsorship (assigning a brand to each piece of the stands around and above the pitch) are largely unchanged from PM2. New to this version is the Assistant Manager - if you can sign a quality one, he can do jobs such as training for you. Tactical depth is increased in PM3 - each player can be assigned a position on the pitch depending on which sector the ball is in, in a manner similar to Sensible World of Soccer. Match coverage is fuller than in earlier versions, with an isometrically-viewed pitch displaying each touch in detail, helping you work our why your team lost 5-0, and how to stop it happening again.",

Different arcade sequences between levels allow you to chase the Dalton brothers or train riding your faithful horse Jolly; to run away from Tornado; and to ride on the raft. Bonus level arcade sequences represent your wrestling challenge with Jolly, bottles shooting, or revolver's barrel roulette.

There are also a few arcade sequences, which can be skipped if the player fails to complete them after several tries.

GAMEPLAY Gato is a 3D real-time submarine simulation game. Gameplay consists of missions where the primary directive is to navigate your submarine to track and intercept (multiple) enemy warships (patrol boats, destroyers, etc.) on the randomly created map and close in for the kill with torpedoes. Combat itself consists of a direct visual of enemy ships (via periscope) and firing torpedoes at the correct angle to ultimately sink the ship. Be warned that although you have the element of surprise, enemy ships can fire back! When all hell breaks loose, an identified submarine is a sitting duck to those Japanese guns. Be prepared to direct your damage control team to fix up your damaged submarine ASAP! The mission ends when you have successfully eliminated all targets in the map.",

You can create up to nine characters. Last thing to do before beginning your quest is a visit to the shop, to buy armor, weapons, light sources and other useful stuff. Now you're ready to hit the dungeon levels. You can control a party of up to 9 characters. The full current level is shown in a top-down view, and you can start to do the usual timeless dungeon crawl routine: slay monsters, open doors, open treasure chests with or with out traps, everything with a somewhat eye-hurting red and green background, complete with simple graphics and a cumbersome user interface. Interesting, however, is the way of how the multi-character party is controlled: Focus is given to one character are controlled one after the other, with each having a few actions before control is passed to the next. This allows some hot seat multiplayer crawling. As to the background story... What background story? This game is not concerned with these trifles.",

The difference here is that the author rebels against the established conventions instead of playing to them, exposing the arbitrary design and story cliches plaguing the genre from the start and having a good time taking it down a few notches with a wicked discordian Subgenius sense of humour. Unlike the irrelevant + unrelated mockery of Ultimuh, however, there is substance behind this parody: Descension's homage delivers a credible game experience, albeit one a decade or so behind the times -- the look and feel of the stickmen's tile-based overland and palace maps could easily pass at a casual glance for actual screens from early members of the Ultima series... it's only in the fine details that you can tell that this isn't being played straight. There's nothing so very unusual about being sent on a quest by Lord Finnish (guess they couldn't afford British)... until he tells you that he needs you to recover his children's book from the dreaded monster \"Bunnicula.\" Is he making fun of you? No -- actually he directs you to the dungeon where it can be found. And sure, maybe \"Mustard\" is a peculiar name for a dungeon... but so is the canonical \"Hythloth\", so who am I to judge. The next weapon up from the Mace is the Herring? Well, I'm sure its smell is quite offensive. And while it is true that I've never seen a game with an esoteric (P)ush a plant option among the character's possible single-key actions, it's implemented beautifully and functions precisely as you'd expect. Goofy, but no worse than Space Quest 4's tongue and nose action icons. In short, it's no less a game for its lack of stony respect for its source material, delivering everything the originals did plus a hefty dose of doesn't-take-itself-so-seriously humour to mellow the repetitive (however classic) find-the-McGuffin, kill-the-Foozle gameplay.",

In the championship mode you will first have to choose difficulty (easy, normal or hard) and the circuit where you want to start (as in real life, each circuit will be also divided in ten parts). Finally, you will have to choose your car, which will be either a Toyota Celica or a Lancia Delta HF Integrale, whom depending on your economical gains after the races, will be upgradeable.",

Ever since he's used his powers to cut off contact with the outside world, Kairn has been living it up, torturing the villagers with madness and death, feeding off of them like livestock and turning the village women into his personal vampiress servants. Meanwhile, the villagers are miserable, as every day they face the possibility of either being devoured by werewolves, gnawed on by zombies, driven into stark raving lunatics, or turned into vampires by Kairn and his posse. A cargo pilot's plane is shot down by a mysterious force while flying over a remote valley in Romania. A helpful village girl named Deirdre rescues him from the crash and takes him to her father Kiril, who informs the pilot that his arrival via plane crash marks him as the chosen one who is prophesied to destroy Kairn. Since Kairn has cut off all ways out of the valley, the only way he is going to leave is, as the old saying goes, over his dead body. That's not going to be very easy, however. Wild animals and unnatural creatures roam the countryside. While some villagers will help the hero to rid them of Kairn, others have been driven mad with despair and by the valley's oppressive aura, causing them to commit unspeakable acts or otherwise act in an unhelpful manner. Even the most trusted allies may turn out to have a few skeletons in the closet... Veil of Darkness is an isometric adventure game with action-based combat and light role-playing elements. Most of the game is dedicated to exploring the game world in a fairly open-ended fashion, gathering information and items. Puzzle-solving is conversation- and inventory-based; many battles are also designed in a puzzle-like manner, with the hero being able to defeat certain enemies only with specific weapons. Heavy inventory management and status ailments to take care of contribute to the game's RPG angle.",

At the start of the game you own 100% of a stock corporation with a few million dollars capital. With this money you buy airplanes, which differ in statistics like range, price or room. On a world map you define routes, ticket prices and load (passengers or commodities) and send them on the flight. The rest is handled by the game itself and the only thing you have to do is buying new planes, sell parts of your stock due to financial difficulties, watch your balance sheet and handle a few random events like strikes or oil crises. Due to the nature of the game you'll spend all your time either on the world map or in front of statistics.",

Rex is soon captured by the planet's cruel elite forces, and must find a way to escape while preserving his virility.

The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.",

Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor introduces a somewhat different gameplay system compared to the previous text adventures of the Zork series. Text-based interaction and puzzle-solving are still present; however, role-playing elements have been added to the mix. The player character has six attributes assigned to him: endurance, strength, dexterity, intelligence, compassion, and luck. These can be determined by the player at the beginning of the game, randomly chosen by the game, or provided as part of a pre-generated character. The attributes affect the outcome of combat, which occurs in certain locations. They can also be raised or lowered during the game by gaining experience, drinking and eating certain items, wearing accessories, or in another fashion (sometimes humorous - for example, intelligence will be lowered by typing in swear words). Many locations and objects in the game are randomly generated.",

The typical, limited, options remain the same as in its mainframe-derived BASIC predecessors: firing photon torpedos or phasers, going to warp speed, raising and lowering shields. The display options similarly hold true to their classic roots, largely based on divining your sector neighbors and ship status by decoding numerical displays and interpreting coloured alerts. The player's ship can still recharge (\"Trillom\" energy reserves) at six friendly StarDocks, which remain targets for an invading force that comes piloting six different varieties of marauding enemy starships. .. just now you get a little less time to plot your next course of action.",

                "plot": "Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor. The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. There are two scenarios available in the game:   * Warlords: 1560 A.D.  The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will  eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The  warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in  the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo  clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.   * Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.  The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D.  to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as  one of his chief allies or rivals.  Samurai The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). Strategy The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table. The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of \"Body Points\" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the point's necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources. Combat Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size. Unit Types The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry  (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain  special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:    * Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map  (explained later) and have 4 movement points;   * Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting  considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking  through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai  leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit  reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points;   * Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive  capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the  opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is  also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have  3 movement points.  Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points. Tactical Combat Tactical combat occurs in two different locations: The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first  arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting,  each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon,  and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to  surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more  damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at  least two squares away (not adjacent).  The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender  chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each  turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well  as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn.  In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading  towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is  defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is  destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.  The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking  forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai  (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or  recruitment to the winner's force.",

To kill an apple you must dig a hole on the ground and wait for one of them to get stuck on it. Then you must hit it with your shovel to make it fall to the level below. The apples die if they fall deep enough. Depending on their color, they may require from 1 to 3-level falls, so you may have to dig several aligned holes. Besides, the deeper the fall, the higher you score. Each level is timed so you must take out all the apples quickly, or you'll lose. If you're successful, the next levels will feature more and more enemies than the previous one.",

No graphics- everything takes place on a text screen. You start out with $500, in one of 8 cities (Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, and Washington DC). Buy and sell 8 different types of drugs (Ludes, Speed, Grass, Crystal, Acid, Heroin, Crack, Cocaine- in order from lowest to highest in street value.) Sock some money into the bank so you don't lose it due to robbery; visit loan sharks (and try to pay them off before they beat you up); buy overcoats to increase your \"holding\" potential, and more. You also attempt to build your reputation- but the higher your reputation, the more cops on your tail. You can try to run or fight the cops (and if you've got the rep, bring along friends)- but fights with large numbers of cops can quickly kill you, and trying to run from large numbers of cops can be nearly impossible. Drug prices fluctuate seemingly at random (but around a base point) when going from city to city, although large scale events like street raids, factory explosions, etc. can cause temporary price increases or decreases in one round while in the same city.",

The player has the usual options such as selecting players and tactics, expanding the stadium and facilities and deal with the clubs' finances, but also to bribe and bung teams and bet on own matches.

The last party sent by the council was lead by Mara, and it has been 18 months since they have sent word. The council assumes the worst. Now these adventurers must infiltrate the underground city of Eriosthe, continue to the eastern end of Eriosthe, the heart of Uukrul's stronghold, and destroy the evil once and for all. The Dark Heart of Uukrul is a first person perspective, turned-based role-playing game (RPG), where the player takes control of a party of four specifically classed adventurers: a fighter, a paladin, a priest, and a magician. The player may use a pre-generated party or create an entirely new party. The adventure takes place in the immense underground city of Eriosthe, which consists of twisting caverns and dangerous monsters. Adventurers may however, take refuge in sanctuaries - safe havens created by the Ancients to provide safe resting, storing items, and access to teleportation portals. Characters sufficiently experienced will automatically be leveled-up here. Sanctuaries also act as a progress indicator as areas accessed after each sanctuary introduce stronger monsters and tougher puzzles. These safe havens may only be accessed after answering the puzzle by consulting the soul amulets (read=copy protection). Aside from sanctuaries, the only other gathering place for adventurers is the marketplace. The marketplace is the only area in the whole of Eriosthe which provides services such as a shop to purchase and sell weapons, items and food, a forge to repair weapons, a hospice to heal wounds and cure diseases, a mausoleum where dead characters can resurrected or laid to rest (removing dead members), a guild to meet and replace (if needed) dead companions with new recruits and a teleportation portal, which links to other portals (such as those in sanctuaries) and other areas. The marketplace also links to temples and the Magic Circle, which allows priest and magician characters to advance (by obtaining rings of power). There are also rumors that a sage provides services in identifying objects somewhere deeper in the eastern tunnels... Adventuring in Eriosthe consists of exploring its caverns and defeating randomly encountered (or pre-set) monsters. An auto-map feature is also available, as well as a directional compass to help guide the way. Certain encounters, such as puzzles may prompt the player to choose various options in handling the situation, each choice with a possible different outcome. Turn-based combat occurs automatically when the party meets opponents while adventuring (indicated by a sudden picture of the opponent). Fighters and paladins take the offensive role, while priests and magicians (usually) take the support role of casting spells, summoning elementals, and invoking the gods. Surviving combat may uncover money and items. The Dark Heart of Uukrul has no sound or music.",

This was one of the earliest games to offer head-to-head play by linking two machines. It comes with a massive manual, detailing all those functions.",

There's also a Survivor mode, which is similar to the early Pool arcade game, in that you're playing alone and have to clear the table without missing more than three times. Speed Pool involved clearing the table as quickly as you can - two minutes can be considered a good time. The Amiga version includes automatic enhancements for accelerated systems, those with more than 1Mb of memory, or the AGA chip set (so a standard A1200 wins on all three counts).",

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks. The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs. The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.",

Around 100 puzzles need to be solved, each one a 2D machine of which crucial parts are missing. The player's task is to choose useful objects from a separate window, position them on the screen and start the machine to see if it's working. A simple example: a piano hanging from a rope needs to be dropped on Al. To accomplish this, you place open scissors next to the cable and drop a ball on them - voila, the rope is cut, Al crushed. However, most puzzles are far more complicated; for example, the player might first have to lure Al under the piano with a fish, which needs to be transported to the right location by conveyor belts. The puzzles involve a score of contraptions, ranging from simple ropes and pulleys to balloons, trapdoors, catapults, bombs, electrical hairdryers, and motors. Sid and Al are accompanied by several other cartoon characters, such as the lady elephant Eunice who will toss things around, or the pet dragon Bik that ignites objects with his fiery breath. Gameplay is spiced up with cartoon animations -- Al chasing Sid is a sight to remember. If the player has solved all of the puzzles, the player can build own challenges with the comfortable editor. Oh, be sure to learn Sid & Al's lessons well -- you never know when you need to get rid of a mouse with nothing but some cheese, a trapdoor and an anvil.",

The AI has been significantly updated from previous games in the series. A full roster of tanks and weapons are included, with Iraq mainly using Soviet machinery. A major consideration involves destroying particular buildings for money, and preventing other particular ones being destroyed, also for financial reasons.",

Answer the question correctly and you get a bunch of ammo and points.",

The defining feature of Amnesia is the inclusion of the whole of Manhattan, more specifically about 4000 separate locations, 650 streets and the subway system. For this reason the original package includes a map and the \"X-Street Indexer\" (a code wheel for finding the nearest cross street when aligning the avenue name with the street address number), so that the player can find his way. The game also simulates the time of day which, for example, means that stores close and open at the correct time. Most puzzles are inventory or conversation-based and it is often required to be at right place at the right time. Additionally the player needs to take care about surviving, so he needs to take jobs to earn money, buy food and find shelter at night. This is represented by the score which is divided into three parts: detective (plot advancement), character (how he interacts with Manhattan's citizens) and survivor.",

Conflict in Vietnam adapts the well tried \"accelerated real-time\" game system of its predecessors to the jungle combat situation in Indochina, with its bizarre balance of power, specific technology (such massive use of helicopters) and unique strategic challenges. Impressively complex for its time, the simulation calculates a day-night-cycle, weather, terrain, supply lines, formations, unit organization and experience, to name only the most important factors. Two players can compete head to head on one computer, soloists may randomize the enemy priorities in some scenarios for added uncertainty on the battlefield. Even more so than in the previous games, designer duo Sid Meier and Ed Bever stress the educational aspect of their well-researched historical simulation: the manual is designed as a complementary read that offers extensive background information to the five scenarios and their 'what if' variants.",

Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.",

The game is a top-down semi real-time strategy game. The game has different speed/time settings (slower to faster), hence the player may manage strategies while remaining in real-time mode. As its predecessor, the game comes with different difficulty settings, symbolized by several famous naval commanders and also comes with a game editor. Ship Types As its predecessor, the game introduces three different types of units in the game:  1. The frigate, small but fastest ship in the fleet.  2. The ship-of-the-line, the primary battleship in the fleet.  3. The flagship, well armed but slow. Flagships are the moving  strategic flags that need to be captured in order to win the game.  The aim of the game is to capture all the enemy flagships while protecting flagships under the player's control. As added difficulty, new ships cannot be built, however enemy ships may be captured by boarding them. Main Map The main map provides information regarding friendly and enemy unit location, ports, and certain waters that may cause damage to ships that cross it. Reparations and supplies may be obtained in the many ports provided on the main map. Whether or not supplies or reparations may take place depend on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting. Certain types of waters may be dangerous for ships to sail across. There are two different types of waters: shallow waters and dangerous waters. The larger the ship, usually the more damage they take when they cross those seas. This however also depends on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting. Combat Sea combat enters a top down tactical map, where the player can control several ships at once. During sea combat, the aim of the game is to sink the opposing fleet by firing cannons or by boarding and capturing the ship. When to ships collide with each other, the combat screen enters the boarding screen. There are two different units provided when boarding: swordsmen (pirates with cutlasses, for melee) and musketeers (ranged combat). The winner is the last man standing. Certain ports provide different type of pirate units, however this is not explicitly mentioned within the game.",

The player's orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. These orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or the officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. As the commander (Napoleon or Wellington), the player must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events, the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ, and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. The player is also given the option to review the battlefield. The game features a single-player campaign only.",

In this game, the player captains a spelljammer ship, consisting of several crew members and officers (which may be equipped with items) as well as the player's main character. Gameplay primarily consists of trading goods between one planet and another as well as completing quests available at each planet. During the course of space travel (first person perspective), the player while travelling in wildspace, may encounter other spelljammer vessels. If the player determines the vessel is hostile, space combat may commence by attacking (or being attacked) by said vessel. Combat consists of two different areas:   * Vessel-To-Vessel combat, where the player can battle other  spelljammers with the ship's weapons. These weapons (depending on  the spelljammer type) consists of ranged weapons (catapult,  ballista); ramming, shearing attacks, and grappling the enemy  vessel to board it.   * Hand-to-Hand combat, where the player boards or is boarded by an  enemy vessel after a successful grappling attempt (top-down  perspective)  In hand-to-hand combat, participants are divided into the ship's mates and the ship's crew. The player has complete control of the ship's mates, whereas the artificial intelligence (AI) takes control of the ship's crew. Victory is decided when all of the enemy mates and crew are destroyed. Achieving victory over an enemy vessel will result in the possibility of the player changing ships, as there are various different spelljammer ships in the game. These spelljammer ships may later be repaired or upgraded with weapons/accessories in any planet port.",

Accustomed to several centuries of peace and virtually disarmed, the humans have no other weapon at their disposal but an ancient starfighter, which has been taken from the Interguild Museum and restored to combat condition. This vessel is humanity's last and only hope. Xatax is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player must defend the remains of the Alliance's guilds against the titular aliens. This is accomplished in a traditional shoot-em-up fashion, fighting waves of alien ships and stationary turrets. The player-controlled ship can become stronger by collecting power capsules dropped by defeated enemies. The game features three different worlds, of which the shareware version only contains the first.",

Said dungeon consists of several levels with increasing difficulty and the (relatively) save town above ground in which the characters can shop and heal. Combat in the game is turn-based. Character improvement uses the traditional experience system, but after a level up the guild in Locklaven has to be visited. The game allows for three races (elf, dwarf and human) and four classes (warrior, thief, mage and priest).",

Four nations are available for the player to choose from; Federation, Romulan, Klingon, and Orion. After selecting who you will play and who the computer will play as you will then need to select the ships involved. This step allows the player to adjust the difficulty of the game to their choosing. If you'd like you can have a one-on-one battle or if you'd rather have an all out war between nine ships on each side. It's also possible to have a battle where the odds are stacked in your favour or on theirs with completely adjustable numbers up to nine on each side. After the number has been decided upon you will have to select just which specific ships are engaged. The choice is yours from hulking freighters to agile birds of prey. Once all the variable have been decided on it is time to do battle. Concentrating more on the various surprises of battle Begin: A Tactical Starship Simulation does not allow players to place their ships wherever they like. Your ships and your enemies' ships are placed at random places as shown on a small thumbnail and specified through written coordinates on the main play/command window. From this point on the strategies are all up to you. You may choose which weapons to fire with, where to move, and even choose to self destruct. Moves are made by typing out what you'd like to do, for example; \"TORPEDO\" or \"TOR\" for short (the game understands three letter summary commands). At this point you will be prompted which bays to fire from or what spread to use (for PHASERS) etc. After this the game will perform the commanded move and the turn will be over. A summary of events and outcomes of the turn will be listed and a read-out of ship status will be updated. Random events such as weapon malfunction are possible and you may get reports from other parts of your ship by typing in the right command. Reports available include; Casualties, Engine Temperatures, and lots more. Battles continue until one entire fleet is destroyed and a report is given at the end as to how you have performed.",

Each block contains questions in six categories;   * Art & Literature   * Science   * Music   * Film and Television   * Sport   * History & Geography  Icons representing these categories are displayed in a pyramid arrangement. The icons of available questions flash in sequence and the players must press FIRE at the correct time to select the icon of their choice. All questions are multiple choice with four answers, one correct & three incorrect, being available. Both question selection and answering are timed and must be completed in eight seconds. Scoring is cash based. All players start with -L-1.00 and each player stakes 20p per attempt. If, by answering questions successfully, a player makes it to the top of the pyramid then they trigger a 'Cash Run' feature which can earn extra money - up to -L-5.00. The game also has a random Jackpot feature in which a player can choose to either to bank the cash they have earned so far or double the money but risk losing it on an incorrect answer.",

Starting in the \"start  state\", the player has to type in the name of the next state to  visit. The trip should be finished in time (optionally). Incorrect  names of states exhaust the available time. The trip itself also  deducts time, taking into account time zones, night stops, and the  time needed to travel. If the player reaches the end state in time,  the thematic picture of this state is shown.   * Play Capitals  Completely identical in gameplay to Play States, but with capitals  as start and ending points.   * Play Quiz Game  The player selects one of the quiz themes, and chooses the  appropriate state that is the answer, after receiving the question.  The themes are:  + Abbreviations (3 kinds);  + Artists;  + Birds (4 kinds);  + Bridges;  + Cities;  + Colleges;  + Facts;  + Flowers (4 kinds);  + Folktale;  + Geography (2 kinds);  + Government;  + History;  + Indian (3 kinds);  + Lakes;  + Landmark;  + Mottos (4 kinds);  + Nicknames (9 kinds);  + People (3 kinds);  + Places;  + Pop;  + Presidents (2 kinds);  + Products;  + Signers;  + Species;  + Sports;  + Trivia (10 kinds);  + Waterway;  + Women.

                "plot": "Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks. They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated! Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him. Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid. Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him. Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map. In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited. Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks. Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the \"drop\" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision. Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death. (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however). Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon. Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.",

Brown monk robes are the only garments allowed, speaking is a capital offense, and every human has been implanted with a tracking chip recording their every move. To track down criminals, the Orbs enlist \"Manhunters\" - humans given access to advanced technology and selected to be a combination of police officers and bounty hunters. The player controls one such Manhunter as he unravels a conspiracy inside the decaying heart of the New York ruins, and a mysterious serial killer on the loose. Each chapter begins with the Orbs assigning the player's nameless Manhunter with a crime (such as murder) or target to investigate. The player gains leads through the use of the \"MAD\" computer, which displays the logs of all civilian movement in an area in an overhead map view. By starting with the victim and following the people who encountered him that day, the player can then go to a first-person investigation view at various New York landmarks to find clues to the suspect's identity. At the end of the day, the player must report the correct name of their suspect to the Orbs. Manhunter uses a modified version of Sierra's AGI interpreter, with a rudimentary point-and-click interface used to locate and uncover clues at the investigation sites. At various times throughout the investigation, the player will also have to directly control the Manhunter in arcade-style challenges, like dodging gang attacks or throwing knives between a bar patron's fingers.",

You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.",

The player can prevent eggs from hatching by destroying the ice blocks containing them. In addition to the normal ice blocks and those containing eggs, there are also three diamond blocks. These cannot be destroyed, however if all three of them are lined up then bonus points are earned.

However, there are only four shuttles available and every transport costs money and time. The used modules determine how well the station works in itself and what commercial output it creates. There is a limited time/money budget and in the long run the station needs to be financially independent, e.g. by developing consumer goods. The game is mostly menu-driven: the player analyzes the statistics on various screens which show information about the crew, equipment, station, budget, etc. Based on this and other problems which may occur, e.g. sick people or the need for repairs, the player takes consequences for further actions. Assembling the modules plays out in a mini-game.",

From the very beginning of the game, you are placed in complex control of your kingdom. Using the mouse as controller and its cursor as your powerful finger, you must build your skills not only as the leader of a Campaign Army but skillfully manage the infrastructure of your kingdom. There are two game scenarios:  1. Against up to six human opponents. The scenario is based upon each  player's ability to build his Kingdom into a society, which must  prosper to enable the player to create the wealth to expand the  growth required to increase the size and strength of his army,  which will enable him to strategically conquer his opponents  territory in his quest to become King of Germany.  2. Head-to-head against computer opponents. In this scenario the human  player must gain the skills as outlined in scenario one, but he is  pitched against War Lords (up to five) who play by different rules,  their aim is to gain wealth by conquest with no thought of  development. They act as barbarians. It is up to human players to  use the more constructive approach to outwit the computer player.",

Level one has rocks and motorcycles that drive slower than you, so they're easy to shoot. Level two is the same, except with red cars that can drive faster than you, so you need to slow down and then jump over them. Other enemies include bouncing squares (level 3), fighter jets that drop bombs (level 4), carpet bombing green planes (level 5), helicopters and landmines (level 6), giant squirrel heads (level 7) and finally mini triangular space ships and a giant diamond-shaped head.",

As a member of the Governments \"Elite Force\", trained to take out terrorists when the talking stops, you must enter one of the towers through its maintenance area, which can be accessed through the sewers. OBC has 40 levels with the first 5 taking place in the sewers where the player, strangely, fights off giant rats and mutants the manual calls Sludge Minions before they enter the first tower to take on the terrorists. The weapons available to the player include a shotgun with infinite ammo, an Uzi, Galil, Flame Thrower and Grenade Launcher (though it functions like a Rocket Launcher). The aim of each level in OBC is to kill a certain number of terrorists on a map before using one of several elevators or stairs to go up to the next floor. OBC pioneered many features including controllable allies (the other members of your squad that join you once you enter the tower). You can order them to follow you or to roam the floor killing all they find. The player can also freely jump between their bodies in the games take on a lives system; as long as the team member they are in isn't killed there is no limit on this. OBC also features a near fully destructible environment; the Flame Thrower can set bad guys, scenery and the level itself on fire, which could make movement extremely hazardous for the player, especially as the fire randomly spreads. The Grenade launcher meanwhile can destroy any wall (with some hard coded exceptions). Like Blake Stone OBC also features textured floors and ceilings. Though unlike Blake, OBC could have several different floor textures on the same map. However OBC's floor/ceiling graphics were partially parallax meaning they appeared to \"warp\" as the player moves around.",

The pure-blooded humans have retreated in large cities while mutants live in small villages on the plains where they make a living by hunting the many monsters. Now one of the human leaders, Lord Dominix, wants to start a war to wipe out all the \"bad-blooded\" mutants. Your village chief has assigned you with the task of preventing this war. Bad Blood is a top-down action game with light role-playing elements. You can not create your own character but have to pick one of the three predefined ones: Varrigg (a strong green mutant who fights with his bare hands), Dekker (a human male armed with a knife) or Jakka (she looks human but can shoot laser beams from her eyes like Cyclops of X-Men fame). The choice you make has only a limited impact on gameplay and storyline. Gameplay consists of exploring the world map, visiting several cities and villages, talking with NPCs, picking up items and new weapons (like shotguns, grenades, Uzis etc.) and lots of real-time combat. Bad Blood lacks character stats and character development. The game has a day-night cycle which influences the amount of monsters on the plains and whether or not you can talk with some NPCs.",

They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them. As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat. This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field support officer to assign missions. The plan is that you will \"borrow\" aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School. In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your \"borrowed\" aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains. Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like Bro/derbund's Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstrike it's possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.",

In a typical Jump'n'Run style you have to jump from platform to platform and fight the numerous enemies with your sword. Fortunately you won't die immediately if an enemy touches you, instead you have a life bar which can be refilled by jumping over various food items scattered around in the world. Each level contains doors in various colors which can only be opened when you have found the matching key for it. Those keys are that important that the number of keys already found is always shown in the upper right corner.

The game features \"Ultima-style\" character generation, in which the player's answers to situational questions help determine the protagonist's character type (diplomat, warrior, thief, or wizard) and attributes. An immense number of skills and attributes, akin to that of Daggerfall, add variety to the gameplay, allowing puzzles to be solved in different ways. Dawdling endlessly in side quests to build up your party is not a good idea, as the player has 100 days to stop the encroaching Plague of Darkness, whose spread is shown graphically in the interface. Under the \"PAL system\", characters not only have their own personalities (aggressive, cowardly), but will speak up and volunteer for tasks they are best-suited to perform (e.g., lockpicking, bribery).",

With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies. The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained. But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently. The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.",

It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long Adol learns that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in the Sega Master System version, Malificus in the English-language computer versions). It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys! Ys: The Vanished Omens is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the \"attack\" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.",

Transland is a short 3D action game with light role-playing elements. It is played from a first-person perspective and it is reminiscent of Shadowcaster. The player gets to explore the environment freely and there are four worlds to discover. Starting in Waterville there are three houses, each with a character inside and a quest that needs to be completed in the correct order. First the player has to go through a maze in Hedgeville to retrieve a jump unit. Once it has been found, the player gets to access Waterville. There, the jump unit is used to press buttons high up in the air to turn on fans. Enemies can be shot but initially only the Lame Gun is available. In this world a more powerful gun can be found, but with limited ammo. The final world is Iceville where a panel remover has to be located. It consists of different areas where the ice has been split into island. Once the item has been located, communications can be restored and the game is completed.

You can find bolts and nukes which allow more powerful attacks, healing potions, scrolls and keys. You can also find gems which allow you to see approaching enemies on your radar.

The game puts it, somewhat blandly, in other words:    YOUR TASK IS TO DEVELOP A STABLE ECONOMY BY THE WISE MANAGEMENT OF   YOUR RESOURCES. YOU WILL BE BESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY NATURAL   EVENTS.  Results of your actions are narrated to you in plain text; player input primarily consists of punching in numbers and selecting the occasional YES and NO (the end of every turn typically asking you DO YOU WISH TO ABDICATE?) into your keyboard, touchscreen -- or TeleType terminal. Gameplay and interaction are restrictive, but the minimalist number-crunching is foundational for all the managerial leadership games that followed: You can buy and sell acres of land, purchasing extra bushels of grain to sow in your fields or feed your populace if so needed. Between turns (only 10 on the iPhone version), citizens starve and are laid low by plagues, peasants immigrate to replace them, and vermin deplete your stores of grain reserves. One year is much the same as the next, though the particular numerical values shift according to elegant algorithms the deeper understanding of which will lead you to a fruitful and harmonious reign, concluding with enthusiastic congratulations from the computer:    A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE!!! CHARLEMAGNE, DISRAELI, AND JEFFERSON   COMBINED COULD NOT HAVE DONE BETTER!",

Destroy their drug pipeline to starve them of cash, but don't hit the civilians or you may get kicked out of the country! The drug lords won't stand by though... And they had used the drug money for an effective arsenal, from missiles to fighters and more. Gather intelligence, decide on strike targets, and launch planes to accomplish their missions. Take over any plane in flight if you think they need help. Send in DEA agents to gather more intelligence and resupply local rebels. Can you win the war? ATAC can be described as two games in one. On the strategic level, you need to figure out how the drug barons are forming their pipeline and the best way to destroy the pipeline while causing minimal damage to the civilian population, while defending your own base against intruders and attackers. You can order recon flights or gather intelligence from rebels and DEA agents on the ground. When you get enough intelligence, you can issue target orders to up to 4 crafts (F-22's or AH-64's). and they'll go accomplish those missions if they can. Once you're off in the air, the game becomes first-person simulator, where you fly through the jungles of South America chasing the target you need to destroy while fighting the drug baron's mercenary forces. How you do in one will affect how you do in the other.",

Mastering martial arts, they found their life tough but very interesting. Until one day a band of thugs attacked them.

The player walks right through the streets of a Polish city (decorated with typical decor of the communist era).

Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well. Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice). Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.",

In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape.

A couple of players are placed in a maze and each of them have time-bombs at disposal. The goal is to eliminate adversaries; players can achieve this by detonating an explosive when enemy is in its range. The walls and obstructions will initially make it difficult for you to move, but most of them are not resistant to explosions, so you can blast your way through. When you knock down a part of the maze, it may reveal a hidden bonus, like increased firepower, additional bombs, and so on. The most important thing, and the core concept of the game, is that bombs have delayed explosion time. You have to be very careful and pay attention where you place them, so that it won't turn out later that not only you did no harm to your enemy, but took your own life instead. Mega Blast also introduces such new gameplay features as: Flying bombs. The player has a possibility to throw them in four directions. Bombs are bouncing off themselves and screen edges, exploding when they reach other bombs' field of fire, or spontaneously, after some time. This offers many new possibilities and enriches gameplay strategy. Bonuses. Apart from standard bonuses (prizes found under destroyed walls) such as increased fire range, or additional bombs, the game introduces surprise items. Those may have a positive effect (ability for the player to walk through walls, increased moving speed, unlimited fire range) as well as a quite undesirable one (bombs spontaneously falling out of player's hands, exchange of places with another character, or mixed up controls).",

A city named Zach's Island developed and flourished. Shandar, a monk of chaos, entered the city along with settlers from the northern lands. His trading in hallucinogens soon made him rich and powerful. Eventually Shandar controlled Zach's Island and had many followers and worshippers. He built a strong fortress, a second Ishar, to challenge the empire. The warrior Zubaran has a vision that sends him on the quest to defeat Shandar and save his homeland. The gameplay system is similar to that of the predecessor and includes exploration of 3D outdoor areas, towns, and dungeons, party management and real-time combat. In the sequel the player can import saved characters from Ishar, or recruit characters to join Zubaran on the quest. The game world includes dungeons, tree-cities, mountain paths with real graded height effect. Unlike the first game, there is a day and night cycle in Messengers of Doom. Shops are closed during the day, and medieval nightclubs are open only at night. The game world is considerably larger than in the previous game. Other new features include the ability to use pet animals as allies in battles, and create magic potions.",

                "plot": "Inner Worlds is a side-scrolling fantasy action game in which you play the role of a woman named Nikita who happens to be a werewolf. The game consists of three episodes (the first was distributed as shareware, you had to buy the full game to play the other three). In the first episode, Nikita is trusted by the village elder to free her people from the Gralob, an evil creation of a misguided genius, so she must travel to Castle Drofanayrb where the creature lurks. In the second episode she finds out that the Gralob was only one of two horrible creatures. And finally, in the third episode, she must travel to a volcanic mountain, inside which the secret of Drofanayrb lives, to fulfill her destiny. The gameplay is quite simple. You can jump, climb, crawl (same things in wolf form, however you're much smaller as a wolf, thus you can squeeze through narrow passages and you have a special \"frenzy\" move that tears enemies apart). In some levels you can find necklaces that upgrade your health, mana or attack damage. You can find weapons such as hammers, swords, or bows, and you can upgrade them with scrolls giving them unique abilities (ex. the hammer can \"throw\" lightning). You can also find different gems that give life or mana and potions that help jump higher, fall slower. Mana is needed for spells that you can aquire from level bosses. Each episode consists about 9 levels, and every third level has a boss. The enemies consist of animals, and experimental creatures of the castle. So you'll encounter spiders, bats, huge centipedes, alien-like creatures, huge green beasts that can stretch their arms. The graphics of the game are a little strange as the characters are in 2D but the scenery and the foreground is a little bit 3D. The music creates an eerie mood suitable for the game.",

After having defeated Nemesis in the past, his minions have erected a huge museleum in his honour, and as a result the townspeople are forced to live under a rule of horror. You must once again venture into the catacombs, defeat Nemesis and free the townspeople. Catacomb Abyss is a fantasy first-person shooter game. Similarly to the previous game in the series, it casts you as a mage who can fight enemies and destroy whole sections of walls thanks to the use of fireballs. You can find bolts and nukes, which make for more effective weapons but are one-use, healing potions, scrolls with hints, and keys. However, unlike in Catacomb 3-D, where you spent the whole game inside a dungeon, here you'll explore various environments, both indoors and outdoors. There are new enemies to face, such as zombies that come from under the ground or skeletons that come out of walls. New to the game is a radar which shows you the location of foes. However, you have to find gems of various colours to use it effectively; each gem allows you to see a specific type of enemy on the radar. There isn't a compass in the game, but various areas of the maps still have specific names.",

This created a convenient atmosphere for bandits, and the land was in turmoil. Then the Emperor ordered the ten dukes to take it on themselves to restore peace in the land, but the dukes instead fought amongst themselves. Finally, the duke Cao Cao took the Emperor captive and he now controls the realm. The player, however, must use five fighters to take on Cao Cao's forces and restore equilibrium to the land.",

As far as gameplay goes, the following can be said: the tourists run at varying speeds, and can only be shot when the finger is fully charged -- beyond these factors, the rule of the day is \"if it moves, shoot it!\"",

Ashtar uses this opportunity to hatch a new plan to plunge the world into darkness. The ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, hits the trail to destroy all manner of vile creatures entering the world while fighting his way to destroy Ashtar, his Dark Sword of Chaos, and whatever else is behind the evil. Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos is a fast paced, side scrolling action game in the tradition of the original Ninja Gaiden game. Ryu is a ninja who can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to vertical walls and climb up and down, which is an ability missing in the previous game. Powerups are hidden everywhere throughout the levels. These powerups include fireballs and ninja stars as before; a unique new powerup is the ninja shadow. Ryu can collect up to 2 ninja shadows that follow his every movement and use the same weapons at the same time that Ryu strikes. Ninja Gaiden II tells its story through liberal use of cinematic scenes interspersed between the action levels. Different levels feature a variety of environmental interaction; e.g., one level has Ryu on a high mountain where snow is falling fast and the wind is blowing hard. The shifting direction of the snowfall indicates how the wind is blowing and Ryu has to fight against the breeze. In a night level, much of the environment is dark and is illuminated only sporadically by flashes of lightning.",

The gameshow was not aired at the times of game production and released for the first time as pilot in 1996. The object of the game is to earn the most money in two Matches, rob the Vault and make a safe getaway. Match consists of two Rounds: the Number Seeker and the Combination Cracker. Round 1: The Number Seeker gameboard consists of 9 boxes, each numbered from 1 to 99. Before selecting a number, players are asked a randomly selected trivia question, with three possible answers. The first player to select the correct answer gets to choose one of the numbers on the Number Seeker gameboard. (If the first player to answer the question is incorrect, then the second player may answer the question. If both players are incorrect then another question appears.) The first available number is highlighted. The player may highlight another number to display \"OPEN,\" \"LOCKED,\" \"CASH\" or the \"BURGLAR.\" If the box reveals: - \"LOCKED,\" the player receives no money and play continues. - \"OPEN,\" the player has found one of the three numbers in the combination of the Vault. The player receives $100 in Match 1 and $150 in Match 2. - \"CASH,\" the player receives $200 in Match 1 and $400 in Match 2. - \"BURGLAR,\" the player loses $200 in Match 1 and $400 in Match 2. If the player does not have that much money, all of the player's money is lost. Once all three numbers in the combination have been found, Round 1 is over. Round 2: The Combination Cracker gameboard consists of 6 boxes containing every possible combination of the numbers revealed in Round 1. The player(s) must answer trivia questions, using the same controls as in Round 1, to earn the chance to try a combination. The safe will turn to each number of the selected combination. If the safe does not open, a buzzer sounds and a new question is asked. If the safe opens, the player earns $400 in Match 1 and $600 in Match 2. Bonus Round: The player with the most money at the end of the two Matches enters the Vault. The Vault gameboard consists of 15 boxes numbered between 1 and 99. The selected box will reveal a cash reward or one of two BURGLARs. The player may continue to select numbers as long as there is cash behind them. After each turn, the player is given the chance to make a \"getaway.\" If player evades, all the money earned in the Vault is kept and the game is over, or player may continue selecting numbers. If the player reveals a BURGLAR, however, all of the money won in the Bonus Round is lost and the game is over. If the player uncovers all 13 of the cash prize boxes on the gameboard, all the money is kept and the game is over. The ten top players of the game are shown in the \"MOST WANTED LIST\" displayed at the end of each game.",

If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument panel allows monitoring of these. You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.",

The pole you control will be  highlighted in red or gold, and in beginner mode pole switching is  automatic to the pole that is nearest to the ball. First player to  score 10 points wins.   * Slamhockey (Air Hockey) - You control the paddle with your mouse,  and the first player to score 10 points wins. In battle mode you  can cross the halfway line into the adversary side of the table.   * Power Hoops - A basketball-inspired table with 35 holes and up to 8  balls. Using the keyboard cursors or your mouse, you select a hole  with a ball. You fill a power gauge (displayed under the court) by  holding down the space bar or the left mouse button. Releasing them  flings the ball towards the hoops. You can play a game of 20, 40,  60 or 80 points.",

It is Mickey's job to travel to each planet and locate the crystals so the inhabitants of the planet Oron may receive their memory back. Information about the different planets and locations visited are displayed on arrival, and XL30 may occasionally give clues through the ships computer.

Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986). ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla. There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open \"Delta\" option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives. You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.",

Character animation is almost identical to that of Another World; the hero is able to run, jump, perform a running jump, and crouch.",

The player controls a single adventurer, selecting randomly-rolled sets of attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity, and Charisma. The vast Telengard dungeon consists of 50 levels down and 200 by 200 rooms each level. Experience is awarded not only for defeating enemies, but also for finding treasure. When the player character gains a level, their attributes increase, and they gain the ability to cast higher-leveled spells. Treasure chests appear randomly in the dungeon. There are also specific features such as altars, thrones, fountains, etc. that the adventurer can discover which may have various effects on the character, whether being either positive or negative. Some creatures will befriend the player, sometimes providing the player with an item and/or healing them, provided the player's Charisma is high enough.",

                "plot": "This is the third game in the Super Cars series of top-down view, arcade racing games from Magnetic Fields. As always, there is also a management portion available in the game (which is optional). The game is basically a re-make of Super Cars II, with added elements, tweaked gameplay, updated 256-color VGA graphics and a new soundtrack. The game lets you compete in three built-in seasons (easy, medium, hard) but also lets you customize your own seasons. All the 21 tracks seems to have been lifted from the previous title, but here you can choose the amount of laps and also race them in reverse. If you are running a season using the \"full\" option, which means including the management portion, you have to buy your own cars to race with. This is done at a car dealer between each race, using a mini-game with different chat options to try to bring down the price. Each new car can carry more weapons and armor, and is also faster. Weapons and armor can also be purchased between each race, as well as repairing any damage you have sustained. Prices vary between races, so there is a chance to gain money by using the weapons as commodities and trading with them. Some weapons have changed from the last game, and you now also have a button to select which weapon to fire while racing. In addition several special events with similar mini-games as with the car dealer will appear between each race in the management mode (and there are several new events compared to the last game). The core of the game, the race itself, takes place on various road courses with tunnels, jumps, railway crossings and gates that open and close. Though the game is an arcade racer, the cars behave somewhat realistically, with power-slides in corners and spin-outs when crashing (which is new to this game). All cars also leave skid marks and craters when they explode, which means that the track looks quite battle worn at the end of a race. In addition to racing against the computer players, you can also race against a friend using a split screen mode.",

In Medieval Warriors, you control either the Blue team or the Red team, each with twelve warriors. There are four maps, or battlefield terrains, where the battles take place, and each of them presents different obstacles and challenges. For instance, in \"Frontier Outpost,\" teams are placed in separate forts divided by a forest and a pond; in \"Castle Keep,\" however, it is just a maze of rooms and hallways. Each of the twelve warriors are distinct with their own stats, such as move range and hit points, and they can also equip different weapons, such as a bow or a sword. They even have their own names. Strategic decisions such as the formation of your party as well as their position on the terrain must be made to take advantage of their strengths and protect their weaknesses. You must also be able to determine which weapon to use, and since weapons are expendable, you have to be careful not to waste anything. While you can choose to play against a computer opponent, you can also play against a human player over a modem.",

And when times are rough, the American army relies on their special forces. A small group of highly trained, superbly skilled, well-armed and clean-shaven elite soldiers boldly go where no man has gone before. At least no honest man. Special Forces let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green. 16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.",

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports. Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right. The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.",

However, a malevolent sorcerer named Sakiski has appeared in the land of Laurasia, using the princess of Bamas in a cruel sacrifice to restore the power of the dragon. The young knight Lychnis and an apprentice magician from Pars named Iris are the only ones who can retrieve the hidden Hartinum arsenal and stop Sakiski. Lychnis is a Korean-made side-scrolling platformer. The player can choose to control either Lychnis or Iris; the knight fights with his sword and can jump on walls, while the magician uses ranged attacks with a staff and can double-jump. Some areas can only be accessed by a specific character. Enemies, treasure chests, and various items can be found in the stages. Enemies drop coins, health-restoring items, or other power-ups upon defeat. If a special \"shop\" icon has been collected, the player gains access to a store between the stages, which allows him to upgrade the characters' weapons and maximum health. With the exception of the final confrontation, there are no boss battles in the game. There is also no password feature or any other possibility to save the player's progress.",

Each of them offers 150 questions about a special topic of the Star Trek universe. This one is about the adventures of the first Enterprise crew around Captain Kirk. The objective of the game, which can be played by up to ten players, is to answer as many questions as fast as possible to beat your opponents and to enter the hall of fame. For every question you have to choose the correct one out of four answers. A timer counts down and the faster you answer the more points you earn. Having answered correctly, additional facts and trivia are displayed. The game is completely adjustable. It offers changing all colours used in the game, deciding to use e.g. the timer or the hall of fame or not, setting how many questions should be played and how many can be answered incorrectly before the game is over for a player. Furthermore, there can be chosen between three different play modes:   * The Number of Questions Game, which ends when the player has  answered a set number of questions.   * The Number of Misses Game, which ends when the player has missed a  set number of questions or has answered all questions correctly.   * The Casino Style Game in which a set number of questions has to be  answered. The speciality of this game mode is that the player has  to place a particular amount of his points before the question  shows up. The game ends when all questions are answered or the  player runs out of points.",

The game is played in text mode only, with your choice made by typing the right letter at the prompt. At the beginning of your trip, you can choose between three types of cargo (with or without time limit, perishable or not) and three routes -- each with different characteristics, like length or chances for bad wheather etc. After these preliminaries, you begin your trip. Gameplay is turnwise. At each turn, you choose your travelling speed (go too fast, and you may be stopped by the police -- too slow and you may not arrive in time). You'll have to keep an eye on your fitness and your gasometer - driving tired can result in deadly accidents, and running out of gas will cost you time and money. Gas and sleep can be replenished at truck stops. You'll also be slowed down by roadworks, flat tires, accidents, traffic jams, bad weather -- all those little things that make trucking fun! To get to New York in time, you'll need strategical planning, and a small amount of luck, too. And you'll get to learn a bit about the daily chores of your average trucker.",

Like its predecessors, the game relies on puzzle-solving, including inventory item manipulation as well as logic-based puzzles. An interactive map, in-game hint system, and the included Encyclopedia Frobozzica are there to make the player's task somewhat easier. The game also includes four graphical mini-games based on popular logic puzzles.",

Your goal, however, is not to escape, but rather to survive: in the maze with you are a number of Beasts, looking like slim sinister Hs. If they find you, they will eat away one of your lives. Your weapons? None. However, nearly all of the walls in this maze can be pushed, like Sokoban crates... only indefinitely stackable. If you are able to line up wall segments and wait until a Beast enters into a gap between them, you should be able to close the gap on top of him, pushing the walls shut and making Beastly pulp. Maneuvre carefully, though, for once the wall segments are backed against the outside walls, you can only pull them back into \"live\", useful territory on certain levels. Also, you may hit a snag against solid-coloured immobile walls, preventing your stack from mashing the intended Beast. (Further complicating things, these immobile, \"static\" walls become deadly to the touch on later levels!) On harder levels, you get to meet the whole Beast family, Super-Beasts, eggs and the Hatched Beasts that emerge from them. Meaner and tougher, they possess enhanced abilities, such as only being crushable against immobile walls or being able to turn the tables and push walls back at you (how quickly the crusher is become the crushee!)",

There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it.

As a result, the temporal disruption caused by his actions is threatening to destroy reality as we known it. A Temporal Corps private is sent to the past in an attempt to pursue Vettenmyer and reverse the changes he made to the world's history. Timequest is a text adventure with graphics utilizing the same interface as Legend's first game: it provides a long list of verbs to interact with still first-person screens displaying locations and people, but also allows and encourages typing commands for the same purpose. The player travels to six geographical locations within nine different time periods from 1361 BC to 1940 AD. It is possible to access any location at any time as the game begins. The player can opt to work on one location continuously, but often it is necessary to acquire items from different areas to solve puzzles. The famous events Vettenmyer has tampered with include the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, the attempted overthrow of the Caliph of Baghdad in 800 AD, Genghis Khan's siege of Peking in 1215, Napoleon's attack on Egypt in 1798, etc. Among the illustrious people the player encounters are baby Moses, Pope Leo I, William Shakespeare, Winston Churchill, and others.",

One of the game's key features is digitised speech, which sounds crackly like a real mission controller would. Telemetry screens provide realism, with the player having to set items and computer programs to get the crucial GO signal. The game is split into several sequences. First is launch, where pressing the button to stop a moving bar at the right point determines success. Course corrections and an orbital rendezvous (to undock the lunar module) are next. The player has to land the module safely on one of three possible landing sites before running out of fuel. The moonwalk is next, and must be completed in a set time before returning to orbit. On the way home the astronaut performs a spacewalk to capture and repair a satellite. Finally there is the re-entry sequence and splashdown.",

As a responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity. Once you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.",

After every 10 levels there is a bonus level where each of the aliens is marked with a number, shoot them in the correct order to score bonus points. As you go through the game, you will be faced with many challenges. Some of these challenges include stronger enemies, faster enemies, enemies that try to kamikaze, and levels that move too fast for your ship unless you buy the speed-up.

                "plot": "STORY The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War). GAMEPLAY Choosing Sides In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as the \"rebels\" - the American Continental Army or as the \"Crown\" - the British Royal Army. Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief:   * The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George  Washington.   * The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.  Revolutionary Politics Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and recruiting new regiments. Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to \"control the seas\" which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury. The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army: The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. Revolutionary Combat The top-down turn-based combat introduces units available in the Revolutionary War: Infantry, Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). Combat near shores may also be joined by Naval units: Fleet and Fires Ships.",

It is considered very rare since the registered version was only sold in the Australian territory. The story behind Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure takes place under Castle Pedabouch. You have to search for the family treasures in the tomb: it was told that, centuries before, Baron Baldric's ancestor, Baron Lazarus Pedabouche studied an evil Wolf-Magic and turned into a cruel tyrant: fortunately, when he seized Rosie, a local milk-maid, he was stoned to death by his own subjects. Rosie died too, and was doomed to haunt the whole castle until the ancient baron was slain. The game is somewhat similar to Impossible Mission 2 and the earlier Montezuma's Revenge because of many elements bringing the game far from the action genre. You have to find flints to light lamps when they go out, and regularly eat food to survive the maze.",

The game contains eight similar mini games in which the the player controls a gun that can be moved left / right across the bottom of the screen. It can also be moved up and down the screen to a very limited extent. The objective in all the games is to shoot turkeys as they descend from the top of the screen to the bottom. The eight sub-games available are :   * Turkey Runs : There are ten lanes running horizontally across the  screen and turkeys run left / right within these lanes. When a  turkey has completed one pass across the screen it will descend to  the lane below and cross back. Points are scored for every turkey  shot and 100 points are lost for every turkey that completes a  successful pass on the lowest run (number ten)   * Mad Turkeys : The turkeys descend randomly from the top of the  screen and if one manages to land on the gun the game is over   * Turkey Invaders : Aliens have trained the turkeys to fly in  formation and shoot back. Actually the turkeys join together to  form a solid 'bar' and the player shoots holes in the formation. On  the lower levels of difficulty they don't shoot back very much.   * Turkey Toro : Here the game is played against a lone turkey that  moves very fast back and forth across the screen descending as it  does so. At some point in its travels it dives towards the gun,  usually at a slight angle that makes hitting it that bit harder.   * Turkey Waves : This is a mass attack by the turkeys. There are more  of them on-screen than can possibly be shot. The player must shoot  as many as possible while avoiding any contact with the ones that  get to the bottom of the screen   * Invisible Turkeys : The same as Turkey Waves, above, only most of  the turkeys are invisible most of the time   * Turkey Torpedoes : This game is the same as Turkey Runs, above, but  here the turkeys \"throw the only natural offensive weapons they  have at you\". These weapons look like brown bricks, they've got to  mean eggs haven't they?   * Turkey Corral : Another Turkey Runs variant but here the turkeys  have guns which they shoot randomly downwards. As with Turkey  Invaders there's not much shooting back on the lower levels of  difficulty.  The player can select from nine levels of difficulty on each game and on most the player can select how long they want the game to last. The game keeps a separate hi-score table for each sub game.",

Environmental factors play the biggest part in this game, as you have to use efficient power sources if possible. You only get a certain level of power at the start of the game, and have to build enough 'green' things to increase it further - trees are the most effective. Once you have a fully functional city capable of supporting military units of any quality, these can be directed off into battle by giving them pre-planned flight paths which can be over-ridden if need be.

Ofcourse, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering. Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like. M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.",

You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage. On many of the levels there will be various types of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may also be puddles of water; if a Gremlin or Mogwai runs into the water, it will split into two. Some levels also contain a refrigerator or popcorn machine which will throw food out onto the screen, or a television which will distract the Gremlins. You also begin the game with a limited number of flash cubes; if you get into trouble, you can use these to temporarily stun all of the Gremlins and Mogwai.

The action takes you down to the twisty network of passageways inside the mine, where several gems are strewn about waiting to be picked up. Soon enough the robots arrive and start running amok, chasing your mine cart along the twists and turns; any contact with them will cost you a life. Luckily (and somewhat unusually, for a mine cart) you're equipped with a gun to shoot them down. When you either collect all the crystals, or hunt down all the errant robots, the exit will appear: pass through it to move on to the next level. You earn an extra life for every level cleared, and the robots in turn multiply and get faster - later levels introduce new enemy types, including the dreaded (and bullet-proof!) skull.",

Chris Crawford seems to have a special liking for problems of global concern. Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject. Sim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems. Contrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success. Balance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.",

Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington's Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You'll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist's plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don't kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist's bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.

Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies. If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over. Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him. Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life. Besides enemies, other hazards need to be looked out for, including spike, spikeballs, water, and fire.",

Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy. The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by \"The Boss\", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops. On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped \"The Boss\" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful. Your mission is to liberate \"The Boss\" and to bring him back safely. You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where \"The Boss\" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely. You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful. In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. Once you reach the point where \"The Boss\" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place. On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect \"The Boss\" whose physical condition has been worn out. Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you.",

These entities live on cells of a flat, 2D binary Cartesian grid and their life and reproduction is dictated according to a few demanding conditions. From step to step, their amount of adjacent neighbours (above, below, on the sides and diagonally) are measured: fewer than two or more than three, and the inhabitant of the cell will die; exactly two or three and they will remain stable; finally, any uninhabited square with three neighbours will spawn forth a new entity. The player is a Newtonian clockmaker god, arranging starting conditions of cell locations on the grid and then setting the system into motion to continue, untouched and unabated, as the game plays itself, evolving, and generations of cells tick along and produce kaleidoscopic patterns, flickering oscillators and stubborn, stable little clumps and lumps (or \"still lifes\"). The game was originally worked out slowly, by hand, on grid paper, blackboard or using tiles on a Go board, after being popularized in Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American in October 1970, but increasing availability of computers have enormously expanded the options available (and enormously reduced the time and labour needed) to cell pattern researchers.",

The Styx cannot harm you as you travel along the border of your captured areas, but if it touches a wall as you build it, the wall goes down - along with you. Other ways to get yourself killed are standing still for too long (while building), and meeting the worm that crawls along the edges of your domain.

The map shows the location of a ranger outpost, your only hope for survival. But you could be anywhere on this map, an area \"twice the size of the state of Delaware.\" To survive, you must determine your location and hike to the safety of the outpost. The game provides six different information screens to aid you in your journey. The View screen shows a three-dimensional panorama of your immediate surroundings. The Topo screen is a two-dimensional map of the 90x67 mile area where you have crashed. Your first job is to figure out where you are on the map. In the View screen you can type commands (e.g., LOOK RIGHT, LOOK UP, PAN LEFT) to help orient yourself on the surrounding terrain. The Status and Inventory screens give you reports on your physical condition and survival gear, respectively. The Help and Clue screens give you survival advice and hints, if you want them, but cost you points. When you are ready to set out, you issue travel commands (e.g., WALK FOR 20 MINUTES) which move you in the direction you are facing (the View screen is redrawn when you reach your next location). To survive, you must also make use of your inventory and things in your environment. All interaction with the game is in the form of type-written phrases: WEAR PARKA USE GUN/KILL BEAR/USE KNIFE/SKIN BEAR USE MATCHES/MAKE FIRE USE FIRE/COOK BEAR/EAT BEAR The game recognizes 300 different nouns and verbs to allow you to navigate, travel, make camp, use gear and supplies, prepare food, care for health and first aid, and make use of wildlife, plants, and weapons. A second scenario is also available in which you play an archeologist in search of the Lost City of Gold. Here, you begin your journey with a \"long-forgotten\" map and several obscure clues.

The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution. The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called \"The Triangle\" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain \"Blackbeard\", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command. The game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity. Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy. Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play. After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship. While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics). While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire. Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain. One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events. There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.",

Tex's first adventure takes the player through the seedy West Coast world of 2033, a setting that combines futuristic elements with film noir and \"hardboiled\" detective fiction styles. The game's main adventure portions are icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. Characters are represented by digitized photos. Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting Tex's Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section. The game also contains side-scrolling action sequences where Tex has to eliminate a number of enemies before being able to proceed to the destination.",

Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.",

The basic cells will grow all by themselves, but also rot if left unattended. Your task is control: Move or destroy unwanted cell blocks, build and link a power supply throughout the structure, prevent decay and (in later missions) virus attacks.

Shoot at everything that moves, and try to find the exit of the multidirectionally scrolling arena. As a backup weapon, you have also a set of five grenades to throw at troublesome enemies. Being hit once or twice is no problem, for you have a rather well-stocked energy bar. Controlling two characters at once means that you may be separated while rounding a corner or another obstacle, but the obstacles can also be used to regroup into a tighter or wider formation, depending on your choice of tactics. This tie-in uses a high resolution, at the cost of colours, to animate the screen with a high detail. Sounds is quite minimal, with no in-game music and simple sound effects.

                "plot": "Dracula in London is a board game / adventure game based on the classic horror novel by Bram Stoker. Tired of his ancient and barren homeland in Romania, Dracula has come to London seeking fresh blood. He has already bitten and transformed Lucy Westerna into a vampiress, forcing the six remaining main characters to destroy her. Players take control of the six survivors and must track down and destroy the evil count before he can claim another victim. Dracula in London can be played as either a board game with multiple players controlling different hunters, or as an adventure game with a single player controlling all six characters. Each character has their own special abilities, for example John Harker is the only character able to follow up on clues, and Dr. Steward is the only character able to pick locks as well as calm down asylum inmate Reinfield if the madman should get out of control and attack your hunters. In order to locate the vampire's lairs, you must investigate local going-ons in London for signs of the count's presence. Once a lair has been found, you can equip your hunters with items and sacred weapons and explore the infested estates for the count and his places of rest. If you are unable to track Dracula down, he will flee to his family castle in Transylvania, and you can give chase for a final battle. But if you fail to destroy all his places of rest, there is a chance the count will escape and all your suffering will be for naught. The highly random nature of the game ensures a different experience each time. The five or six locations in London are randomly generated, and can contain clues to be followed, coffins to be destroyed, vermin to be fought in combat, and even encounters with the evil count himself. Also, many different random events often occur which can influence the course of the game. Hunters may be stricken with illness, forced to visit an ailing relative, or arrested by the police for breaking and entering. The madman Reinfield may slaughter your hunters at Dracula's command, or he could become the unlikely hero who shows up at the final battle and dispatchs the count for you. One of your characters, Mina, may be targeted by the count, and if you fail to protect her Dracula will transform her into a bloodthirsty vampiress.",

Similar to Raptor, Flying Tigers II is a typical vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up, where you have to survive until end of level. Planes attack you relentlessly, and each four levels you get to fight several bosses - very powerful and strong planes. You can also come upon zeppelins of steel (don't ask), warships and active volcanoes. While you'll be flying over the sea most of the time, you can also encounter patches of land with ground installations of them; all of these can be blown up. During your mission, you'll find weapon upgrades (which also heal you a little). The yellow bonuses change the type of your main weapon (which is basically a machine gun), while the blue ones give you a secondary weapon - such as lasers, missiles or flaming napalm! You can shoot the bonuses to change the weapon contained within them. At the end of every level, you get bonus points for the planes and buildings you destroyed.",

The game can be played with 2-6 players, any combination of which can be either human or AI controlled. There is no real sound in Armada 2525, save for the occasional system beep. Game play can be either open ended or set to a specified number turns. There is no set objective to gameplay (except for your 4X's) and the story line is almost non-existant: It is the year 2525 and as your race begins its first step in extra-planetary colonization, you discover that you are not alone in the galaxy. You must compete with up to 5 other races in colonizing planets, and the near lack of diplomatic interaction in the game pretty much insures that you will need to build defenses early on. Unlike Master of Orion, diplomacy only occurs when an opponent requests peace, but you cannot make such requests yourself. Armada 2525 offers a fair assortment of ships (approx. 20) and buildings (approx. 15), which can only be built after the appropriate technological advance. One can build research labs which are dedicated to one of eight available scientific fields: weapons, construction, hyperspace, force fields, biotech, planetology, info science, and psycho science. Combat can be controlled to an extent - though you cannot affect the individual actions of ships, you can issue general orders and arrange them into formations. Your race will start at a predetermined homeworld from which it will expand to colonize new solar systems in the usual 4X quest of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating of your opponents.",

He gets a call from Marshall Alexander, a business tycoon who owns most of the industry on Mars. It seems his daughter Alexis has run away from home, and taken \"something else\" with her. Marshall won't say what that something else is, but he is willing to pay handsomely to get it (and his daughter) back. Unlike its predecessor, the game contains only adventure gameplay, removing flight simulation and action sequences. Basic gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the first game, placing interrogation and choices above object-based puzzles. Verb commands are used to interact with the environment, while interrogating suspects usually involves selecting conversation options. Making a wrong choice may sometimes prematurely end the game or render it unwinnable.",

The spaceships' weapons of attack are phasers for short range and photon torpedos for long range, both of which use up the energy bar; if this bar is drained, you can't attack. As defense there is the impulse engine to move, as well as a cloak and hyperspace to jump to a random location, all of which use energy also. To alter gameplay, when switching on gravity the ships gravitate towards the centre of the screen. Photon torpedos are affected by gravity in the same way as the ships. Also, you can add a planet in the centre of the screen, which your ship can crash through, draining your shield energy bar. When a ship's shield energy is all gone, one shot or planet collision will cause the ship to explode, making the surviving ship the winner of the game.",

Typhoon of Steel includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater (over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.",

The former goals can also be pursued by 2 to 4 players cooperatively on one computer, or they can decide to play a melee round in which each player tries to do the other teams in. Every single Clonk can be controlled by the player, in contrast to the group-wise controls of the predecessors. Clonks also learned to swim and dive, dig in different directions and build bridges. 4-Way scrolling allows for bigger scenarios filled with new raw materials and endangered by volcanoes, earthquakes and hostile creatures. A variety of new buildings, weapons, materials, vehicles and weather conditions to help or hinder the players actions make the game more complex and put a heavier weight on strategic thinking than classic Clonk games. The game also includes a mission editor, with which players can create their own scenarios by creating a landscape and defining every aspect including weather, initial property and goals.",

Considering the penalty of thievery is the removal of certain body parts, our young hero must be careful in his profession and ultimately (among others) train himself to access and steal from the city treasury. Keef the Thief: A Boy and His Lockpick is a first-person perspective role-playing game. It has elements of parody, clearly identifiable from various descriptions in the game and enemy names during combat. One of the goals in the game is to steal everything in sight - at least in the city. The game map itself includes, beside the city, various dungeons, jungles, and an arena, among others. The game introduces four vital elements of game play: Thievery, Adventuring, Combat, and Alchemy:   * Thievery  The thievery element is based on the ability to disarm traps before  the player can loot treasure. There are many houses or other places  where the player can steal valuable objects (at least within the  city walls). The higher the skills, the more options the player has  to rightly pick which course the player wants to choose to disarm a  trap.   * Adventuring  When the player has stolen everything valuable from underwear to  gold crowns from the city, eventually the player will have to  venture outside the city into the unknown depths of the surrounding  jungle. There are a lot of places that has yet to be discovered in  the game. Just be sure to be well equipped with armor and weapons.  Monsters have a bad habit of popping up, almost always!   * Combat  The first-person real-time combat setting comes complete with a  top-down radar indicating the player's positioning and the enemies.  In the combat screen the player can melee to victory or just shoot  them from a distance. That is if the player has the appropriate  weapons available.   * Alchemy  For the most part it's alchemy, though magic spells are also  created through this process. Collecting ingredients is one thing,  experimenting on what works is another. Sometimes the player may  get lucky and find a recipe. Sometimes.",

Karnov can collect power-up orbs which can increase the amount of fire he can breathe out. Karnov is also able to jump, with the height being increased by collecting boots. Other items Karnov can carry and use include bombs, ladders, boomerangs, clappers (which destroy minor enemies that are currently on the screen instantaneously), and shields. Occasionally, Karnov will be able to make use of certain items such as wings which let him fly in the air and a scuba gear helmet which lets him swim underwater.

The goal of the game is to explore and dominate the world - which is inhabited by natives - before the other three players do so. You can play against computer players, or play your friends through modem link. You take control of 'pieces', such as infantry, submarines, battleships and aircraft carriers. There are also special units, such as the spy who can slow unit production and steal secrets from opposing teams. You control your army through the \"ComCen\" or Command Center, analogous to the King in chess - if you lose your ComCen, you're out of the game. Gameplay is turn based with the player managing different aspects of their kingdom each turn, such as the economics of their cities (called 'Burbs'), their army, airforce and navy, any battles that are progressing, espionage tactics, treaties and alliances and random events. Random events are picked through a 'card' system, a card being selected every five turns. Drought, plague, taxpayer revolt, pope visits and battle fatigue are a sample of the many random events that can occur over the duration of the game.",

Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the \"Actisource\" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden. In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.",

This game is called Star Lords. It is much like Master of Orion, only rather unpolished (even by the humble production standards of the almighty MOO). The basics are there, though: you start out with one planet in one star system and are charged with building a galactic empire. This means researching techs, building ships and colonies, and confronting alien civilizations. Several randomly generated opponents will do their best to stop you from realizing your goal. Released as freeware in 2001, Star Lords is an artifact for those interested in the history of MOO and game design in general.",

There are numerous ways to freedom - back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn't be. Rule number three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard's routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.",

Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp. Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.",

Players win points by finding the answers before their opponents do. The first player to earn 1000 points is the winner, and goes on to play in the Championship Round. Rules of this computer edition are: In Main Game Round One, a question is asked and a gameboard appears. Players must buzz in once they have located the correct answer on the gameboard. Players buzz in by pressing certain keys on keyboard. In Main Game Round Two, a new gameboard appears and the point values are doubled. Round Two is played the same as Round One. To locate an answer on the gameboard each player should: a. Use arrow keys to move the pointer up or down to the correct row and press the Space Bar to confirm; b. Use arrow keys to move the cursor across the columns to the first letter of the answer word and press the Space Bar to confirm. c. Use arrow keys to move the cursor across the word and press the Space Bar on the last letter. d. Correct any mistake and reset the row or column, pressing Backspace. This resets the cursor to the top left position on the grid. The winner of the 1000 points in the Main Game Rounds plays the computer in a Championship Round. 1. A human player may be substituted for the computer if you wish. 2. A category is announced, and a gameboard appears with six hidden answers. 3. The first player to find one of the answers buzzes in and locates it. That player then has 20 seconds to locate the other five words. 4. If the player is successful, he/she wins the amount that the board is worth. (The first round is worth $200, the second round is worth $300, all the way up to the fifth round which is worth $600.) 5. If the player who buzzed in first cannot find all the answers in time, the other player will be given a chance to find the remaining words and win the money. 6. If the second player also cannot find the answers, then the first player wins the money. 7. Play continues until one player wins $1000. 8. The winner of the Championship Round goes on to play the Solo Round. Solo Round 1. In the Solo Round, a new gameboard appears, and the player is given 60 seconds to locate the answers to 10 questions. If the player succeeds, he/she wins $5000. 2. The player may pass any question by pressing the \"P\" key and come back to it after the tenth question. 3. If a player does not find all 10 answers, he/she earns $100 for each correct answer. The game is available to 1-2 players. Hall of Fame stores all the most successful players.",

There are three kinds of combat simulations:  1. MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you  should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and  eliminate surrounding enemies;  2. FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you  should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and  enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;  3. ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you  should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical  position.  Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.",

The gameplay flows in real-time mode. For each roll of the dice a question must be answered. The first player should press his/her keys to have a chance to answer the question. If the first player to hit their key answers correctly, then he or she have control of the dice and may decide whether to roll them or pass them to the other player. If however the first player to answer answers incorrectly, then the other player has control of the dice and may roll or pass. In the one player game, you compete against the computer. In novice mode the computer plays less intelligently than in expert mode and responds incorrectly to questions more often. The two player game follows the same format as one player game, but with both human opponents playing at hot-seat. The object of the game is to clear the columns of numbers thus winning the money total at the bottom of the column (if you win the game). In order to take numbers off the board you must answer a question correctly or be passed the dice. You roll the dice trying not to roll a total that doesn't equal some of the remaining numbers on the board. For example if there are only three numbers left on the board it is probably a good idea to pass the dice since there are quite a few illegal rolls. For every Doubles you roll, you get an insurance marker which allows you to roll illegally without losing the game (but only once). You can take off 1,2,3 or 4 numbers from the board at one time. Winning the competition, Bonus Round will be proposed to a player. Its idea is to clear all of the numbers off of the board, without rolling an illegal combination (without an insurance marker). If a player achieves the goal, he/she get an additional $10,000! After a player completes the bonus round he/she become the current champion and subsequent players must play him/her until they defeat him/her. But the current champion does not appear in the High Rollers Champions file until he/she loses. Hi-scores are written in Top Ten Table.",

Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Beginner/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring.",

These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over a river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break walls to find secret areas. Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way.

In exchange for this favor, Marid has to find out who really killed that man, who turned out to be the mafia ruler's assistant and whose death may be but a part of a larger scheme. Circuit's Edge is based on George Alec Effinger's When Gravity Fails novel. It is set in a dark version of the future, in which the Islamic world has become the sole dominant power on the planet. The events of the game take place in the Budayeen, the criminal and entertainment district of an unspecified city in the Middle East. Mature themes such as violence, drug usage and sex are liberally used to paint the game's grim setting. Though it contains a few adventure game elements, the game is primarily an RPG. The player navigates Marid through the city maze-like city, which resembles a pseudo-3D first-person dungeon area. Marid has to eat and rest from time to time in order to stay alive. Cybernetic modifications can be purchased to increase the protagonist's combat and hacking abilities. Money is gained by defeating enemies on the streets in simple turn-based battles, or by gambling. The game's interface is somewhat similar to that of Mars Saga.",

Your journey begins when Executive Time Spinner (ol' T.S., you know) drops you ill-prepared and poorly armored into the fray, to fight off everything the Razerrians ...antiquated holdouts from the Snarr Sector... can drop, kick or throw at you. Blast through their defenses, traverse the 50 levels of time blocks they'll use to impede your travel. They'll tantalize you with pictures from your home planet, hurl you through space, instead of merely time, and dazzle you with nefarious patterns reminiscent of the arcades in the Neo-Draconian Sector in a celebrated age long past. As for other Break-out clone games, the basic plot is: BLAST IT! When you hit the blocks, they explode, disappear, change your launchpad into something more (or less!) functional, or alter the 'ball' in some beneficial - or nefarious - way. The worst of these is the dreaded smiley. The smileys don't do anything. The ball metamorphoses into a cute, fluffy, and USELESS tennis-ball-like blob, and won't work on any of the blocks until it turns back into a blue piece. Some of the blocks put a nasty spin on the ball, and there's a magnetic block that does exactly what you'd like it NOT to do. You can also add spin to the ball by striking it on the move - just like with table tennis. The longer the ball is in play, the faster it moves, and the less time you have to hit it. Some effects are controlled by a timer, and will revert to their previous state if you can outlast the time clock. In Two-player mode, saves (and losses), and multiple-ball episodes, are twice as much fun, and it's only half as difficult to win. You can also play two-player mode with one person!

The racket can fire rockets at any time by using a 'Gigablitz' weapon. To activate it, hold down the 'Alt'-key and wait for an indicator to reach the top. The trick is, in order to use Gigablitz, no balls must hit the racket, or the Gigablitz sequence will be aborted. When some bricks are hit, they release gadgets that can be collected. Many of them enable more balls on screen, enlarge balls or let you advance to the next level. Beware though, do not collect red-coloured gadgets as they can shrink your racket, invert racket movement or substract points. Finally Tronic also has a built-in level editor that lets you create, play and save your own Tronic levels.",

It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way. The story takes place after the events of the first game. The mad king Trebor has committed suicide after becoming obsessed with the amulet and fearing the return of Werdna. With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get the staff back along with Gnilda's blessing. Though Knight of Diamonds is the second scenario in the series, it was the third game in the series released for Famicom/NES. The NES version was redesigned to be played by new parties and the maps were re-designed to be non-linear. This makes the NES version more like a unique entry in the series rather than a port of the computer versions. The Famicom version is compatible with the ASCII TurboFile, an accessory that allowed the player to transfer characters between the Famicom Wizardry games. This feature was removed from the NES version. The Famicom version also allowed the player to switch between English and Japanese text.",

Although it's strategical simulation is rather simplistic, taking a more entertaining approach, it has many features, available options and a lot of feedback from the computer (including tips from the computerized Patton's and Rommel's). The game had a feature very similar to today's well-known Fog-of-War, though it's functionality was not as smooth as it is today.

The main character has been replaced with a stereotypical Georgian loader, and maze designs are slightly different than in the original. The game uses the 16 color high-res 640x350 EGA mode.",

At first, you'll have to identify the safe, guessing the manufacturer, model and class of the safe and the lock. For each identification item, you have three attempts; after the third unsuccessful attempt, the program identifies it for you. Once identified, your task is to open the safe. The program provides an on-line help that gives you some guidelines as to how safes work, what tools to use, and how to use them. To open the safe, you can choose between different methods; their success depends on the current safe, which may or may not be broken due to broken drive pins or stuck levers inside the lock etc. The simplest method of opening a safe is dialing: This lets you turn the combination wheels while listening for the sounds inside the lock that give you hints about the wheels' positions and the correct combination. In some situations, for example when the lock is broken, dialing fails; then you'll have to drill the lock, either to cut the fence of, or to have a look at the wheels. You'll have to take great care about the correct position and angle when drilling. If all fails, you can resort to blow the safe open using explosives. The program then gives you hints about what was wrong with the safe, and how you could have opened it. After you have opened a safe, the next safe is presented to you -- there is no story, and you get no points. Safe Opening Simulator is an unusual and, as far as I understand (I'm no expert ;-), quite realistic simulator with educational value for wannabe safe crackers...",

The more traffic is in the air, the more hectic your job becomes. You have to set routes for the planes and organize punctual arrivals. The game is also featuring emergencies, to make your task more difficult. It is possible to connect the game to a Microsoft Flight Simulator installation on another computer. Tracon was used to train professional ATCs in the early nineties. Then Wesson decided to develop special simulation units for professional users and continue the Tracon series as entertainment.",

Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson are awakened by a crewman to find an apparent suicide on the ship. There is something mysterious about this suicide, of course, and it's up to the famous detective to find out the truth. As his mind is not as sharp now, he will rely on the player as his longtime companion Dr. Watson to help him with the investigation. There are many characters (including famous real-life figures such as escapist artist Houdini, Gertrude Stein, Sir Lawrence of Arabia, Pablo Picasso and Thomas Edison) to observe, follow and spy on, and determine who may be a suspect during the time-limited game. There are six smaller cases within the whole mystery which must be solved in order to arrive at the final truth. The player also must be discreet in the investigation; ordering Holmes to do anything offensive might ruin his reputation.",

SpaceKids is a good look at what interactive movies looked like just before the CD-ROM format became the new standard for extensive multimedia-rich content storage -- instead of meg-heavy digitized actors we get byte-thrifty pre-rendered sprites in front of 3D backdrops, twirling around the screen and stretching or skewing in realtime with every possible bump or jostle. To please the kids, pretty much everything in this game that isn't made of candy has got a human face with big, pleading eyes on it somewhere. Gameplay loosely follows the model set by Dragon's Lair: non-interactive animated segments (sometimes prolonged ones) are punctuated by episodes of player input, consisting of moving the actor of the moment -- sometimes our protagonists, sometimes their opponent -- in the right direction at the right moment to pass some timed obstacle or choose a fork in the plot. Unlike Dragon's Lair, death does not lurk around every corner; failing to successfully traverse the obstacle (or, uh, interact vaguely with the new strange situation in the arbitrarily appropriate fashion) generally yields only another opportunity to do so.",

The first one is \"Friendly match\" for 2 players (playable only if a joystick is installed along with keyboard). The second one is \"Euro Cup tournament\" for 1 player. Different options such as match length (2/4/6/8 minutes), weather conditions (wet/dry), formation of the teams (4-4-2/4-3-3/4-2-4), and national anthems (on/off) may be adjusted. Simulation of the players` team actions lies in the following. When the ball is near the player of your team, this player is selected as active and becomes controllable. As this player you should run to the player of the opposite team and take the ball, after that you may run with the ball, which is stuck to your feet, give a pass to another player of your team, or strike the ball. Your player may be moved in 8 directions. Your goalkeeper keeps your gates by himself. Camera follows the ball but with some delay, so the ball is often not in the center of the playscreen as well as nearest player of your team is not visible.

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices - pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.",

Uncover two of the same colors and they will stay open, making it a memory-like game. Open all oxydstones to solve a landscape. To make things more interesting there are walls, pitfalls, quicksand, one-way walls, breakable tiles, reflecting lasers (for Deflektor-like puzzle solving), movable blocks (for Sokoban-like puzzle solving), tiles that crumble away when roll over them, doors, switches etc. Some of the landscapes contain items that you can pick up and use. Items include pieces of paper with hints, umbrellas that give you the ability to float, bombs to blow up walls, a spring to jump across gaps. To mix up the gameplay, every tenth landscape is a meditation landscape where you simultaneously control several green orbs. Manoeuvre each of the orbs into a pit to solve these landscapes.",

They chose golf. Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game. Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing. The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.",

Depending on the resources they find, they'll start developing advanced settlements and cities, which can be used to start trading efforts between the fatherland and the new empire. There are five other nations with their own colonies in each area though, so competition is fierce enough to require the game to feature a combat module. This also comes into play when negotiations with the natives fail, and on sea, when facing pirates or enemy warships. The game features a comprehensive mouse-driven interface, as well as a choice of starting fatherland.",

You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is \"reset\" and you get up to speed again. The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.",

The courses provided include real locations: St. Andrews (Scotland), Cypress Creek and Doral Country Club (USA) and a fictional one, The Gauntlet, which, as the name suggests, is designed to push the player's skills to the maximum. The PC version utilizes the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via the company's patented RealSound process. Quips like \"No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap\", \"Straight onto the fairway\", and \"Looks like he hit the tree, Jim\" are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.",

The protagonist is rescued by Granger Tinker Brin O'Keef, a member of the galactic Alliance, which fights a highly advanced mechanized race known as the Korok, whose goal is to destroy all life in the galaxy. The hero decides to join the Alliance and help them in their battle against the Korok. Nomad is a space exploration, trading, and combat game. Its basic gameplay mechanics revolve around trading with various alien races(based on bartering rather than currency), as well as defending the ship against hostile crafts in an action-oriented space combat. Compared to other space simulations, the game is more story-driven, featuring scripted conversations with characters and information-gathering. The game world includes several hundreds of planets and eleven alien races. The player-controlled ship can be customized with weapons (such as missiles), loaders, shield generators, engines, scanners, and jamming devices.",

Initially you can only manage the lower teams, but if you succeed over a few seasons you will become respected enough to have a chance to get the top roles. The focus is on ultra-realism, which makes it very hard to quickly transform a club's fortunes, as there is a lack of money at many of the smaller teams and attracting players is harder than in the Premier Manager series and similar. Matches are viewed from top-down highlights, with 3 levels of detail (goals-only, highlights and kick-by-kick) offered.",

Below the surface of Jupiter, a machine runs out of control and floods the underground tunnels with synthetic creatures. You must descend into the depths to find and destroy the machine. The adventure is split into a freeware episode of 15 levels titled The Weapon Recovery and the second episode The Machine, which contains 50 more levels and must be purchased. The basic challenge is to explore each dungeon level and collect treasure while fighting enemy creatures in simple hit-vs.-hit fashion. Precious metals and gems can be sold in shops to buy better weapons and equipment; raw crystals gained from defeated enemies help improve your character's abilities, such as damage ratio, sight range or performance speed. Through battles and careful exploration, your protagonist becomes increasingly more powerful and efficient. All level layouts and contents are randomly created. Each level introduces one new creature and at least one new map element or item. Reaping the Dungeon adds a number of original elements to the genre:   * The drop shaft that leads down to the next level relocates in  random intervals. It must be found and tagged. Data chips scattered  throughout the level reveal its current location;   * In addition to weapon/device energy and health, your character has  an oxygen pool. Each step consumes oxygen, which makes  uncoordinated running-around in the dungeon wasteful and  potentially life-threatening;   * Energy, health and oxygen can be harvested from cell plants, which  grow in a five-step life cycle. Good timing is essential to  maximize the cell harvest;   * Reaping the Dungeon's magic system is based on rare mushrooms that  give special powers for several turns, such as improved sight  range, perfect weapon proficiency, seed planting or the ability to  walk through walls.  Reaping the Dungeon's graphics consist entirely of customized 16-color ASCII characters. The sound is limited to PC Speaker noises.",

These are right angle bends, straight lines, or cross roads. The spider starts from a randomly placed green start cell and the player must extend the path from this cell by rotating the web elements in front of the spiders path. When the spider travels through a cell the cell turns solid blue and cannot be re-used. By ensuring that the spider has travelled twenty inches along its current path and then taking it off one edge of the screen and back onto the other side the player can reset most of the solid blue cells. This means that they can be used again to prolong the game and achieve a higher score. Some squares, when reset, are completely blank and these must be avoided as the game ends when the spider's path comes to an end. Elements are rotated by clicking on them with the mouse, each click rotates the element through ninety degrees. Points are scored the longer the game lasts. Bonus points are scored by exceeding the specified target and by picking up flies along the way. The game sets a minimum number of points for the player to achieve. Once that has been accomplished the player is able to advance to the next level. The shareware release had seven levels while the full release has thirty. The game is entirely controlled via the mouse.",

Genetically modified organisms led to the death of all life forms except androids produced for the last war. They collected resources, built robots, sent them out to fight, and so on. The Earth made a replacement for the biosphere based on radiation energy rather than solar energy. The androids have discovered that the radiation storms leave a trail of nuclear material and have started collecting it for use as an energy source. And they've started to evolve. Collecting the metal debris, they've analyzed and redesigned the robots, advancing their evolution. Because of this situation, planetary review panel has asked the design council to stop the demolition of planet surface and reallocation to design pool. And design council has accepted the recommendation with one condition. A clearly dominant android form must emerge before the next review, or the planet will be reassigned to design pool. So, player controls a mobile android mil-ind-camp complex, commonly called a robot city. Player's aim is to conquer all other robot cities on the continent and develop manufacturing and design capabilities to make him the supreme model. The continent is divided up into the zones. Each zone contains an enemy city. Player's city is mobile and can move between zones, and around the map within a zone. Player have a central store of metal and energy used to build robots. These player sends out from city to collect more energy and metal, fight enemy robots, and locate and destroy the enemy city in each zone. Player's production line can produce only a limited number of robot models and it takes time, energy and metal to produce them. Player can obtain the plans to produce better and more devastating models by defeating mutant cities in particular zones which are marked on world map. The combat and production capabilities of the enemy cities vary from zone to zone, and player must find a route to each mutant city which does not take him through a zone containing a city more powerful than player can handle, since player needs to destroy the enemy city to be able to pass through a zone. There are a number of things which make life more difficult. The rugged terrain of the devastated earth restricts the movement of some robot models. For example, hover powered models cannot cross hills or broken ground, and tracked models cannot cross lava flows. Radiation storms will destroy any robots which get caught up in them, and electromagnetic storms may destroy any flying models in a zone. The game has three screens from which player controls the action:   * The Icon screen has icons with various functions around the edges  including icons to access the other two screens, and a radar map of  the zone player is in at the center. The radar map can be made to  display a wide variety of different information by selecting  various icons.   * The main map is where the action takes place. This is a scrolling  map of the zone, showing player's city, his robots, enemy and the  various type of the terrain and other hazards player encounters.  Action here is controlled via a cursor which player can move around  the map.   * The production screen is the factory floor from which player  designs and builds the robots, and keeps track on his metal and  energy resources.",

There are various statistics which are affected by the happenings on the battle field, e.g. destroying factories lengthen the time the enemy can get new aircraft. Overall the game features many real and fictional campaigns, as well as an editor to create more, with the winning condition to either destroy the enemy's flight force, his capital city or wearing him out. When a flight battle or bombing occurs, the game switches to a side-scrolling combat screen. Here players actively participate in the combat; during dog fights the goal is to destroy the enemy and bombings are a matter of releasing the bomb at the right time while avoiding flak fire. Those sequences can be automatically calculated by the computer; then the pilot's skills affect his changes of success.",

The background story: While driving out on holiday, you get lost in the middle of nowhere, when suddenly your tire has a puncture. Remembering a driveway just before the tire blew, you return to it, and guess where it leads? Right, to Castle Ralf. (Reminds me of Rocky Horror Picture Show, that.) The game starts with you trying to enter the castle. Once you did it (this won't be too difficult, but will cut off the way back), you'll quickly find that Castle Ralf is quite big and peculiar, extending onto three floors and a basement, including a Grand Central Closet and a sauna. You'll find some keys, enough burnt pizza for 87 people and a gigantic cheese, a video game called \"Chiwawars!\" which you can play, but also some technical puzzles which you will have to solve, designed by the castle's slightly eccentric owner, some Dr. Bellefleur. Castle Ralf features an innovative user interface: Besides typing your commands the traditional way, you can also select verbs with the cursor keys. This comes with a simple but well-done parser which understands some unusual and/or useful words, like IT, MAP (which gives you a map of the places you visited so far -- interactive fiction with automapping!), SMELL or COGITATE (which may or may not give you some hint). You can also use multiple commands, as \" N. W. S. GET BEANS.\" All in all, the parser / verb selection combination works quite well, once you got used to it. The game's puzzles are quite challenging, but logical. As you will die a lot, you should SAVE often. The texts are short and to the point, being often quite funny and even a little Zorkian. They thus manage to convey a unique atmosphere while you are exploring the vast castle and try to solve Bellefleur's devious mechanical puzzles.",

Other features include dozens of practice missions, a career mode with the possibility to create a customized player, and a multiplayer mode for 2 players on one PC.",

The objective is to catch the falling spheres with a test tube, moving it sideways underneath the tubes exits with the mouse, keyboard or joystick. The test tube can hold up to five elements. The player has to press a button and drop the elements inside a beaker at the bottom, aligning them vertically, horizontally or diagonally by three or more of the same color. Every level has a number of drops allowed, and when the player fails to catch too many elements the game is over. Besides the elements, special balls also appear randomly inside the tubes that help or hinder the player. The multicolored element acts as a wildcard, and can be matched with any color. The F element removes space inside the test tube. The M element fills the test tube with assorted balls. The C element creates a gray ball that can't be matched. The game comes with two modes. In endurance mode, the goal is to make as many points as possible, by making matches until all the allowed drops are spent. In wave mode, each level (or \"wave\") has objectives, like making a specific type of match, that must be completed before finishing and moving to the next one.",

As the title suggests, the game's focus is the European Theater of World War II in 1944-45, and the Normandy Invasion in particular. Although there are only five scenarios, each can be customized through multiple variants (with different initial deployments and reinforcement schedules) and levels of difficulty. Another nice feature is the ability to play using either traditional boardgame symbols or unit icons. Both sides (Allied and Axis) can be played, and two players can play head-to-head in hotseat mode.",

For a game that arrived some 24 years ago now, it still manages to feature an impressive amount of remarkable details for the time, such as VOR towers readings, DME, ILS, and coupled with the game aspect that is to deliver post, Solo Flight is clearly quite unlike what you will have played before. Score for choices made meaning you must ponder certain things like how much fuel you might need for each delivery. Each mail delivered is to a different airport but the option is also there to carry several loads, each an additional weight that needs to be taken into account. Having a heavier payload means burning more fuel and a difference to how the plane handles, but potentially a higher score can result. It's this design that makes Solo Flight so intensely fun each time. Various weather conditions such as clear, nightime, light cloud and even a heavy cloud that requires IFR skills. It's entirely possible to fly using just instruments in total cloud blindness up until the point you pop out of a cloud to see the runway hopefully as you had planned. Indeed an accurately planned route using both VORS can have yourself precisely lined up and ready for a final descent using ILS. You really do need the maps though and attempting Solo Flight without them is fairly pointless - playing this seriously requires maps for VOR plotting.",

For chocolate, and for caramel and gingerbread, and for cookies and crisps and marshmallows and lemonade and bubblegum and jelly bears and ice and cream and sugar frosted chocolate bombs. All right, we've all had such moments. But Lolly is a doll. Animated by a stroke of lightning, she suddenly has life, a sweet tooth and a quest: Onward to the land where candy grows and the refrigerators never run out! It's a hostile world for small, innocent and rather hungry little dolls - that's why you've got to help Lolly find her way through eight big levels in this jump'n'run game. After the escape from the toy factory, the way to the promised land leads through places like a ghost town, a snow world and even Lolly's own cottony dreams. The way is far from safe: plenty of traps and monsters threaten a doll's life, but good timing, athletic leaps and an ample supply of lollipops to fling at obtrusive enemies help mastering any challenge. In desperate situations, Lolly can take a snapshot with her pocket camera, which instantly destroys all opponents on the screen. Huge level bosses guard the exit of each world; defeating the mega-monsters requires specific tactics. Fortunately, there is support: chests contain key items (to unlock different parts of each level), power-ups and plenty of sweets, of course. On the downside, the boxes may also yield harmful objects that jumble up Lolly's controls or even hurt her. Tender dolls of that model can sustain three hits before they break apart. There's a time limit for each level, so sucking popsicles in a corner won't do. You cannot save the game, but you get a personal passcode after each level.",

There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this. The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball & Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.",

In the final battle between Gods and Giants, the dead will rise from Hela's realm of torture and rally under the banner of Loke, the God of Mischief, who shall turn all of Midgard into a battlefield against his brother Odin, the one-eyed, father of the Gods of Asgard. As Thor drops Mjollnir, his hammer of lightning, as Freya falls from her Golden Cart and Heimdal is pierced by the horns of Loke, the fire giant Surt shall wield his ensorcelled sword and purge the land in flames, so that eons later, a new dynasty of man can arise. Thus the sage Mimer has seen it in the Well of Wisdom. It is the dusk of the gods. Can fate be turned? Odin summons a champion, who has died on the fields of battle and is guided to Asgard by the Valkyries. This champion must find the six elements needed to forge a chain that can bind the hell hound Fenris, the Giant's best ally in the upcoming pandemonium. In addition, the champion must stop the quarrels of the Gods. Thor has lost the head of his hammer. Vidar, a son of Odin, strives to slay Hodur, who is said to have killed Baldur. Freya, the goddess of love and beauty, desires a necklace held by four dwarves. Frey is madly in love with the giantess Gerd, daughter of Surt, who demands the all-powerful Sword of Victory in exchange for the hand of Gerd. As you plunge into the whirl of intrigue, deceit and greed in the realm of the Viking gods, you travel the lands of the living and the dead, visit Aesir's underwater realm and cross the oceans in a magical pocket ship, and have a hand in all the legends from King Beowulf's fight with the dragon to the slaying of the Lady of the Hill. Dusk of the Gods is a role-playing game that focuses on exploration of the Viking legends and conversations with various characters in a large, seamless game world featuring a day and night cycle. The role-playing system in the game is rather simple: the main character has only two basic statistics (Warrior and Sage abilities), and the action-oriented battles are based on an uncomplicated point-and-click interaction. Magic system relies on usage of runes to cast spells.",

The survivors of the war have split into several opposing factions, and life on the island of Florida is constantly threatened both by the ever present threat of radiation-induced mutation and by the Killer Clowns, a group of deranged and heavily armed marauders descended from circus performers stranded on the island by the war. When the Clowns murder the only man with the knowledge to stop the spread of the mutation, it becomes your task to locate a cure to the mutation before it overtakes your group of survivors as well as what's left of humanity on the island.",

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves. From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you lose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit. The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.",

The first thing he has to do is find companions (luckily, Hell seems to be a rather densely populated place), who would help him on his perilous journey through this very unpleasant place.. Escape from Hell is a role-playing game that uses the Wasteland engine. Richard's party navigates the top-down environments, encountering and interacting with characters, friendly and otherwise. Compared to Wasteland, the role-playing system is simpler, with more traditional leveling up and more focus on combat abilities. The skill system is present, but skills need to be acquired or learn from trainers rather than increased by repeated usage. Most of the skills are combat-oriented, though some (such as hacking, swimming, and others) apply to non-combat activities. Despite its horror premise, Escape from Hell contains many comedic elements. Many of the weapons and other accessories have funny names, much of the dialogue is humorous, and characters who join Richard's party are popular historical or fictional figures such as Stalin, Genghis Khan, Hamlet, Mozart, and others.",

Playing the matches is optional, as you can simply watch instead. There are 4 playing views, and you can play in position or as a team. Initially your player is by far the best in the team, so choose his position and use him wisely. Once you reach retirement age you can only play the matches for 3 out of every 4 seasons (which is poorly explained by an 'assistant manager' concept, but is more likely an attempt to make the game harder. This would make little sense though, because scoring is very, very hard in player-manager mode).

The titular island has been formed in the Azores group of islands, caused by volcanic activity. The player initially controls Captain John Stark, the commander of local militia known as Free Villages Police Force (FVPF), who attempt to protect their home from the invasion of armed troops under the command of General Masters. As Stark, the player has to recruit civilians and members of FVPF in order to join forces and prevent Masters from reaching the base located in the south-eastern part of the island. Midwinter is a hybrid game that combines elements of strategy and action. The player selects and controls the 32 recruits as they attempt to protect the island within a limited amount of time. Two hours of game time are assigned to each recruit; afterwards, the strategy battle moves to the next turn. During their turns, the recruits fight enemy forces in action-oriented combat reminiscent of a first-person shooter. Specific and detailed injuries add a tactical edge to these battles. Enemy units are mostly composed of armed snow buggies, as well as supply vehicles. Eliminating a large amount of them or killing the commander of the unit usually successfully completes the mission. Terrain plays an important role in the game, as many snow-covered mountain areas are impassable, and the player must plan ahead how to advance. The player can use snow buggies, ski, and cable cars to access the goal. When recruiting characters, the player has to pay attention to their personal relationships. For example, Stark can recruit his girlfriend, but another character will refuse to join because he is in love with her and jealous of the Captain.",

                "plot": "The Great Machine is an allegory for thousands of years of cyclical human history (lessons unlearned, doomed to be repeated) embroiled in continuous military warfare and conflict wherever there are people; the cruel teeth of its gears oiled with the blood of young idealists and its furnaces fueled with the defiled bodies of innocent non-combatants. The function of the machine is nothing beyond self-perpetuation of its own antisocial operation. For some reason warfare is a popular theme for games -- likely on account of a sanitized presentation, playing up the glamorous aspect of saving villages by destroying them. This game does not pull these punches. The player directs the irrelevant choices of a little man caught in the crossfire, compelled by circumstances to serve a tour of duty in his nation's military service and attempt to kill other men such as himself based on orders from his supervising officers, who must have good, albeit undisclosed, reasons for issuing such instructions. The protagonist is assigned the black operation of the assassination of a charismatic cult leader, \"Los\", whose group's non-aligned activities are undermining the efficiency of his unit's operations in the area. With some ambivalence, but eager to remain on the right end of the gun, the player heads out into the bleak brutality of a tormented world gone mad, its piebald absurdity underscored by ongoing nightmares and hallucinations either the result of supernatural forces or incipient shell-shock-induced dementia. Author Jonas Kyratzes takes a departure here from the Myst-style 1st-person graphical adventure genre informing his other works of philosophical gaming activism, instead presenting the effects (and the futility) of human agency in the face of the insanity of the trenches through an all-text multiple-choice Choose-Your-Own-Adventure idiom, yielding reams of moody reading -- occasionally breaking from prose into free verse to indicate the stark effects of sudden physical (and gradual mental and emotional) trauma -- between player input opportunities. Like Mercy before it, the gameplay here is entirely secondary to the story being told; the author is presenting a morality play about authority and how, as Mao said, all political power comes from the barrel of a gun. The player is not an author of this story, merely a player on its stage, endlessly going through the meaningless motions, between elusive sparks of genuine hope, of an existential nightmare from which one can't escape -- Orwell's \"boot, stamping on a human face forever.\"",

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player.

In every game you only play with the black pieces. There are five levels of gameplay that go from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). The board you play on features coordinates in which you type in the order to pick a place for your pieces. However, your pieces will only go on lines that are either vertical, horizontal or diagonal to one of your previous pieces. You also have four options: pass, switch, unmove and quit at the main menu. The game does not feature any high scores.",

In most of them, sparse locations, mute NPCs and to-the-death monsters turn up in predictable (classic?) configurations, fortified with occasionally inspired, occasionally jarring train-wreck often-anachronistic mashups of cognitive dissonance -- here special unlicensed cameo appearances from Gargamel, Azrael and several Smurfs... also rising to North American fame in a period roughly contemporary to the IBM XT.",

Giant transport ships are launched, each carrying 10 million people. Sent ahead of each of these ships is a Trailblazer-class scout. Controlling one of these Trailblazers, it's the players mission to find a suitable planet for a new colony, to scout for natural resources and to deal with various alien species, who might be both friend or foe. From a robot-controlled home base, the Trailblazer starts exploring the nearby star systems (two different star clusters are selectable, representing different difficulty levels). Planets in uninhabited systems can be claimed for their natural resources. If aliens already inhabit a system, diplomatic negotiations can be opened. Since the resources of the uninhabited systems won't be enough for sustaining a colony, trade agreements with the aliens are necessary. Each alien species has its own attitude and quirks. Not all of them are friendly, and some might demand that the player attacks their enemies before they agree to trading or a peace treaty. If hostilities with aliens begin, there are a variety of combat options. The Trailblazer itself is rather slow and sluggish, but is equipped with a powerful main gun and a gun turret. It can also launch remote-controlled combat chassis in various configurations: as a guided missile, a kamikaze ship, or a fighter, the latter two being controllable by the player. The systems of the Trailblazer (the weapons, shields, sub- and faster-than-light engines) are powered by various parts. On the engine room screen, these parts can be individually mounted or removed. Combat may damage the parts. The same parts are used by different systems of the ship, so they can be moved around to improve one system at the expense of another. New and replacement parts can be collected from the wreckage of destroyed alien ships and space stations, or be acquired through trading.",

The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots. To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.",

Both got married (though most probably not to each other) and begot children: the Wiz had a son, Wizkid, and Nifta had eight kittens. Their peaceful life ended when the evil mouse magician Zark kidnapped the Wiz, Nifta, and all the kittens, imprisoning them in different parts of the world. Wizkid must venture into unknown realms and rescue his father together with the feline family. Wizkid: The Story of Wizball II is a sequel to Wizball. This game deviates from the original in many ways. The screen does not scroll and Wizkid does not bounce around like his predecessor. The player has full control over Wizkid and his movements. He has to be moved around the screen, bashing into bricks (which come in different shapes and sizes) so that the flying bricks collide with the onscreen enemies. Once the screen is cleared of all the enemies, coins are dropped, which must be picked up quickly before they disappear and the player proceeds to the next screen. Killing multiple enemies with a single brick releases a bubble that will sometimes offer a nose (to juggle bricks) or teeth (letting Wizkid grab hold of bricks), but more often they turn into colored notes. These must be combined to form tunes, as patterned at the top of the screen. Once the player completes a tune, you are taken to a shop where you can buy items needed to progress to the next stage. If Wizkid has bashed all the bricks on a screen, but failed to remove all the enemies, the player may be taken to a puzzle screen, where he must solve Crossword 2091 for bonus money. The player has a number of words to put on the screen, but they must all overlap each other and use each other's letters. Each move has a time limit. If the player fails to complete the puzzle he is taken back to the level. When exiting a shop the player can choose either to exit as a head or a body, which is Wizkid with arms and legs. Assembles in this way, Wizkid is now limited by gravity and can jump around and use onscreen objects such as ringing bells or cranking wells. He may also come across interactive elements which he will need to use with items in his pockets. Most such levels require the player to solve inventory-based puzzles.",

Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.",

Build a successful military career as Krellan commander completing all missions given to you by the Krellan Fleet HQ against the United Galactic Alliance (UGA) and climb the military ladder to finally reach the rank of Admiral. Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander is a 2D starship simulation and strategy game using ASCII graphics which involves intergalactic reconnaissance, starship battles, diplomatic tactics, and planetary invasion, comprised in specific tasks given to you for each mission. Unlike Star Fleet I: The Battle Begins, the time flow of this game is not turn-based, the universe \"moves\" when your ship moves, while on other occasions, it is real-time. Playing Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander consists of issuing commands for your starship, may it be for navigational or combat orders among others. Issuing commands is done by pressing a specific letter on the various display screens which issue a certain command. The purpose of the game is to successfully complete an assigned mission, while doing so you may also further increase the \"ratings\" of your missions by carrying out independent reconnaissance, battles and other \"mini missions\" identifiable within the game. Gameplay elements of the game may be identified as the following: Space: The Final Frontier Each mission is designated in a random area of space within the borders UGA territory. This regional space is approximately 35 light years wide and 15 light years deep [note: light years is a measurement of distance, not time], or known as \"sectors\" in Star Fleet 1. Within this regional space, there are solar systems with planets, black holes, ion storms in addition to friendly and enemy ships and establishments. Planets within a solar system may be orbited by your ship. A landing party may also be sent down for a survey or establish a base to further supply routes. If a planet contains intellectual life forms, diplomacy may be carried out (if the civilization fulfills certain requirements) to bring them under the Empire, or simply send in shock troops to capture slaves...before or after you bombard them. Intergalactice Combat Combat comes into 2 different forms: the first is combat between ships and starbases, the second is planetary invasions. Starship battles occur when an enemy ship (or starbase) is detectable in normal space or in orbit. When combat issues (or while in orbit), the gameplay changes from turned-based to real-time. Ships may then commence with firing torpedoes and phasors. If a ship's shield is down, the opposing ship may send in a boarding party to commence a hit-and-run tactic, capture the ship, or slaughter the lot. Capturing ships will enable you to detain prisoners, including the captured ship itself (if delivered to a Krellan Starfort), significantly increasing your mission ratings. Planetary invasions consist of bombarding the planet with phasors and torpedoes (optional) to weaken its defenses and later sending in legions down to the planet to capture it. Planetary invasions may only be conducted in planets with intelligent life forms. Another option is to totally obliterate the planet, using obliterator pods...turning the planet into a dust of asteroids. [Note: In earlier versions of Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander, planetary invasions does not work.]",

Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFay. The game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a 'scene' level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted. Here you can pick up, drop, and manipulate quest items.",

The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more. Most of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark. The game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point & click and has no function to save progress.",

                "plot": "The fourth game in the Wizardry series, The Return of Werdna takes a decidedly different approach from all the games that preceded it. Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge. At the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom. Werdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor. The game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.",

Searching for a place where he could rest and restore his strength, he left the city - but never returned. Now, a new hero must rise and defend his homeland. Times of Lore is an action game with light role-playing elements, which follows the adventures of a young warrior (strong barbarian, armored knight, or quick valkyrie) to assist a weakened kingdom from various threats, and to recover special Artifacts that once made the kingdom strong. Gameplay consists of moving the protagonist in real-time (day and night) through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player character gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as he completes tasks and advances the plot. Conversations are handled through key phrases. Battles involve a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.",

                "plot": "Mason Powers, a former CIA agent, awakens in a Turkish asylum with many of his memories erased. Gradually recovering from his amnesia, Mason realizes that he has been locked up for allegedly murdering his supervisor. Convinced that he is innocent, Mason eventually escapes from the mental hospital. However, that brings him back to his old job, where he becomes entangled in a world-wide conspiracy of espionage, terrorism, and murder. Countdown is an adventure game with emphasis on traveling and conversation, though inventory-based puzzles are present as well. Over the course of the game the protagonist travels to many different locations around the world, though the areas themselves are fairly small. Interaction is performed by choosing verb commands such as Look, Get, Taste, and others. There are no \"hot spots\" that indicate than an object can be interacted with. A bulk of the game is dedicated to conversations, which include, among others, special commands such as Help, Hassle, Pleasant, and Bluff. Sometimes choosing a wrong action may lead to a premature end of the game. A few segments involve navigating top-down mazes. It is possible to die in various ways and also get irrevocably stuck. The game imposes a time limit of ninety-six in-game hours on the player. Certain actions - such as spending more money and traveling by plane instead of a train - may help the player stay well within this limit. The game is notable for using digitized photography alongside hand-painted graphics; character portraits are all scanned photos. It also uses digitized music and speech samples, which can be heard even with a PC speaker thanks to a special software.",

As the game progresses, the screen scrolls sideways and evil gangsters pop up from behind windows and buildings. The player must take care not to hit innocent bystanders, including women, children, and pets strolling down the street. There are also two indoor scenes, including a warehouse filled with TNT and the finale that takes place inside a bank. Capone was released in the early years of the Amiga, and had a very unique look for its time. Although the major selling point of Capone was it was the first light-gun game available for the Amiga, players could also play entirely with a mouse. During mouse play, a cross-hair cursor appears on screen. Firing is accomplished simply by hitting the mouse button, or trigger on the light-gun.",

In order to get airborne, players have an option of using a tow-plane, a winch, or by-passing the take-off and starting in the air. Much of the game centers around learning how to ride thermals so that the glider will gain altitude. Players can seek out thermals using clues found in the layout of the land, cloud formation, and weather. Weather effects can be customized.

The only difference is the direction you are heading. As the German Commander your main goal is east to Alexandria. As the British Commander your main goal is to sweep Rommel all the way back to El Agheila and win the game. Knights of the Desert provides for solitaire play where the computer directs the British.",

Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.",

Gameplay for leader is action-oriented, with a menu that allows to Parley/Travel/Rally Troops, change formations or use items. The leader attacks with Melee and Projectile buttons. Some classes are more reliant on teammates than others. \"Parley\" allows you to buy (but not sell) items, or buy a Safe Pass (skip the area)",

But natives won't lose a chance to make some money of you: if you don't want your vacation to end in 1 day, you will have to catch not only a considerable amount of fish, but also the kind and the quantity of fish requested at the beginning of each day. If you should fail, you wont be able to pay the cost of your boat and buying gas, bait, etc... So, renting a boat for approximately $60, you are ready to catch such predator fishes as black marlin, blue marlin, swordfish, or tunny. The gameplay includes the economical and strategical management in the port or open waters and fishing simulation in the sea. In managerial phase you should buy an equipment necessary for the fishing such as Flares, Batteries, Lines, Fuel, and Sardines, examine the variable weather, set a destination point on the map, and navigate your boat to this point. You should have appropriate amount of fuel to navigate to open waters and between the ports. The biggest fishes are waiting for you in the northern deeper waters, so you will have to make a little money in the coastal areas before venturing to the north. Also the ability to send S.O.S. signal is available in case of very bad situation. In simulation phase you should mount a line, assign one of five bites, move the rod up/down, accelerate/decelerate the boat, throw a certain number of sardines to attract the fish, and catch the fish to earn the money and honour. The game has a three difficulty levels, it may be saved in progress and loaded later, and the highest achievements will be stored.",

Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety. While the first level confines the entire neighborhood to a one-screen maze, later levels span multiple screens, thereby increasing the challenge. Further, later levels also add time limits and additional keys that the player must collect before attempting the rescue mission.",

Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats, and the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is quantum black holes. In Starcross, you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. STARCROSS, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time will be different. The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep. As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.",

You should find certain keys to open certain doors. Also after killing certain murderers, you'll be provided with certain secrets given to you by the survived guests. Main parts of the story is told in comics art-style without any literary material. The problems for you in the mansion along the murderers are: 1) the timeflow, so you should act quickly; 2) your life energy, so you should keep it as high as possible blocking the opponent's hits; 3) number of the bullets for the revolver, so you should use them wisely; 4) no ability to save the game, so you should break through to the finish during the single seance of the gameplay; 5) the mansion's owner, whose identity you'll understand at the very end.",

This can be played either as a continuous battle, or with short breaks to catch your composure. The role-playing elements eschew the Ultima-style plan view in favor of a pseudo-3D system. Deism and Shamanism are just some of the included magic disciplines. Magical vehicles help you get around the 100 landscapes more quickly, although you spend much time on foot. The game takes place in a fully active universe of characters such as villagers and giant beetles, all getting about their business within a day/night cycle and variable weather.",

The map is set up in squares, where you move you square units, with an image on, around. Pretty standard stuff for these style games. You run them into each other when you wanna fight. It offers tree scenarios set in 43/44, 10-12 turns each, with victory conditions determined by 'location' and as many units destroyed as you can of the opposite side.",

The game is required to play the worlds created with it. In Gold Box games the player typically controls a party of adventurers, leading them through cities and dungeons (presented in first person perspective), talking to people, finding treasure, buying things in shops, fighting battles, etc. When combat begins, the screen switches to a top-down perspective where the player can control each party member while they fight the opponent. This is also how games created with Unlimited Adventures look. Construction Set The basic elements of each created game (i.e. design) are its modules, that is, the levels that the player will be travelling through. The designer builds the modules by arranging walls and choosing floors and ceilings. Then comes the most important part - setting up the events. The events control everything interesting that happens in the game: combats, text messages, Non-Player Characters (NPCs) joining/leaving the party, the party visiting a temple/shop/tavern, etc. Unlimited Adventures comes with a lot of art, depicting various monsters, characters, items, etc. It is also possible to import own art. There are a lot of pre-made monsters (e.g. goblins, dragons, zombies, etc.) and humanoid enemies (e.g. brigands, bandits, evil mages, etc.), which the designer can edit freely. Unlimited Adventures comes with a complete example design, \"Heirs to Skull Crag\".",

The first level is the amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, and antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs to eat three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the rodent stage, where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four you need to guide a beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The fifth level is the gorilla stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that are trying to steel its orange stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser gun to fight off mutants that are trying to take over the earth.",

Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously. Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster! Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but the player must succeed controlling a handicapped person.",

One day, while out on assignment with his friend Sci Fi, he witnesses the massacre of a \"Normal\" village, by a group of Protozorqs (physical mutants). Raven and Sci Fi disobey their instructions from the Netwerk, and fight back against the Protozorqs. In the ensuing struggle, Sci Fi is captured and taken back to the Protozorqs' mountain temple. Raven vows to save her, and so gets himself captured, too. As the game starts, Raven is a prisoner in the crazy Protozorq temple, where something sinister and utterly insane seems about to happen. Apparently, Raven has to go through five ordeals, to become a \"Divo\" (a Messenger Of The New Solution). For each ordeal he completes, he receives a Vort skull. Can you complete the five ordeals, save Sci Fi and destroy the fiendish Protozorq plot, in time? Chamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess (originally entitled Kult: The Temple of Flying Saucers) is a puzzle-solving adventure game. To solve the puzzles, Raven will sometimes need to collect and trade items; but more often, usage of the eight \"psi-powers\" is required. These powers range from a simple light spell (\"Solar Eyes\") to instant-kill (\"EV\" - extreme violence) and complex psychological effects (\"Brainwarp\"). The five ordeals can be completed in any order, or even skipped altogether to reach a different ending. A time limit is imposed on the ordeals, and is calculated by turns. A \"wait\" command, which skips a turn, is also available.",

As pilot you will have full control of your bomber and 10 crew members, each of which plays a different role in your mission. After each mission providing you have survived you will be evaluated and awarded points based on mission difficulty, bombing accuracy and aircraft destroyed. The more points you receive the closer you get to being promoted. You start off as a Lieutenant and can make it all the way to Brigadier general. Also depending on how many points you earn in a mission you can receive a medal or if you are wounded a Purple Heart. Each mission lasts approximately 10 minutes. The '50 Mission Crush' was the name given to the crushed service cap of the battle hardened veterans who flew the B-17 during WWII. It was a mark of distinction and honor.",

A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty. Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.",

At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. \"Energy\" plays an important role, there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you. The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a \"robot hull\" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a \"Meanie\" which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining. Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.",

In the future, man carelessly poisons the earth with nuclear waste. The polar ice caps have melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile. It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island. Controlling a hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable. To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island, which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it. Obstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power source unless it is connected by a \"land bridge\" to the generator. You have the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground; necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it; eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you. The entire game plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint. A movable cursor selects where to move or what to manipulate. There are 10,000 islands on Earth to purify. If you can make it past Archipelago #100, you are then free to select any of them.",

The two main improvements are the ability to run on monochrome screens (although it looks better in color) and a more responsive feel. Finally, my version should work at the same speed no matter how fast your processor is; I have heard that that is a problem with the commercial version.",

When the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the Earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical Earth simply isn't there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, builds an interstellar ship. A team of four specialists is then sent into deep space to find unique parts for the construction of the Centauri Drive, a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect. Planet's Edge is a sci-fi role-playing game with space exploration and other gameplay elements, including spaceship combat, mining for resources, trading, and light puzzle-solving. The game begins on the moonbase, where the player can access the shipyard, crew quarters, warehouse, and research lab. The player is put in control of four pre-made characters: William Dean (pilot), Katya Mershova (weapons officer), Nelson Ngatadatu (engineer), and Osai Tsakafuchi (medic) . Each of these characters can be cloned for different attribute rolls, while retaining their primary skills: astrogation and ship weapons for William; light, heavy, and hand weapons for Katya; ship repair and computers for Nelson; and first aid and xenobiology for Osai. Unlike most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points and can only become stronger by equipping better weapons and armor. The game is completely open-ended, allowing the player to travel to any of the dozens of stars. The player physically navigates the ship on an overhead screen. Entering a star system enlarges the view, allowing the ship to orbit a planet. Though most planets cannot be landed on, a large amount remains that can be explored on foot from a top-down view similar to that of Ultima VI. Each planet is represented by an enclosed populated area, usually containing friendly NPCs as well as enemies. Advancing the storyline involves gathering clues from various characters as well as obtaining objects, many of which have to be used in other locations in a puzzle-like fashion. Combat on the ground is turn-based and can be avoided in most cases. Planets can also be mined for various elements such as organics, metals, liquids, etc. These elements can be then brought back to the moonbase, where they can be used to produce better equipment for the crew members or upgrade the spaceship. Alien technological blueprints can also be recovered and used in the research laboratory to develop new ship models. The spaceship can carry cargo between planets, which can be traded or used to bribe hostile aliens. If the bribe is unsuccessful or the player decides not to resort to it, a fight against a hostile ship ensues. These fights are action-based, requiring the player to manoeuvre the ship in real time while shooting at the opponent.",

It simulates the assault operation initiated by Allied forces in September 1944 to take over the bridge of Arnhem, the Netherlands. There are British, Irish, Welsh, Polish, and American units of Allied forces against German forces and 5 scenarios, including advance to Eindhoven, operation 'Garden', operation 'Market', the bridge too far, and entire campaign from start to finish. The gameplay is shown on scrolling map in turns. The player of Allied forces places airborne units all over the map on clear places and waits while they are landing. After that the player selects the units and gives them orders to travel, dig in, or change size. Units move on the grid of rectangular cells. The bombard attack is possible for certain units. Axis forces defend from the attacks. Historically, Axis won this battle, and it is player's opportunity to alter the history. The game comes with detailed instruction booklet and includes historical notes on the campaign, maps and photographs. Two players representing Allied and Axis may be computer or human.",

This time the main goal is finding thirteen keys which are divided over dungeons all over the country. The change of scenario, the predecessor was set in medieval times, means that there is modern weaponry and technology. In order to find the keys, the player needs to build up an army and gather enough money to search for them and defeat Medusa's city. There are several ways to do this, the most important being trade. Other options are searching for treasure on the world map or playing roulette at a casino. Important for success is the assembly of the army as there are multiple races, classes and weaponry to choose from. The main addition in comparison to the predecessor are the dungeons which are shown from a first person-view. The player can take up to three companions into those dungeons and needs to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in real-time (ranged with firearms) in order to reach the goal. The game is also in real-time when travelling on the world map; only inside the cities where the management part takes place the time is stopped. There is also the occasional arcade sequence to solve.",

There is limited time to prepare each case before taking it into court and every choice takes time in the game, so the player must be well prepared. When the player feels he is ready to go to trial, he can take the case to court. During the courtroom sequence there are many different choices to be made such as which witnesses to question, when to make objections, requests for recess, etc., and the final judgement can change depending on how good the player's arguments or choices in pre-trial preparation were.

To collect the hearts, you have to solve a series of puzzles such as, how to turn a blue heart to red, how to get four spaces over water with only three blocks, and what order to do things in. There are many more obstacles such as boulders, arrows, balloons, monsters, and fire. You have to solve the puzzles to get to the hearts. Many times, you have to do things in a certain order or the other heart will become blocked by obstacles. This game is sort of like Chip's Challenge. Hero's Heart also has a level editor with all of the obstacles that are in the game. You can change the background, the music, and make unique levels. Hero's Heart requires a lot of thinking so you can solve the puzzles. Then when you finish a level, you can do it again and try to get the least amount of moves. Hero's Heart is a shortened version of Hero's Gold, which includes more obstacles and levels.",

The king loved blocks, he'd played with them since he was a child and he loved them almost as much as he loved his daughter, the beautiful Princess Pentaguin. The princess must marry someone worthy so the king had a series of rooms constructed such that extreme cleverness in moving and using blocks was necessary to escape from each. The suitor who could complete all these puzzles would be a fit match for his daughter. Block-man is a commoner in the land of Bentangle but he loved the princess nonetheless and vowed to win her hand in marriage. The player controls Block-man. Block-Man is in a game-area bounded by red bricks and flaming torches, representing the room he's in. Every room has an exit and from his starting position Block-Man must get to that exit. In his way are walls and pits that he must overcome. The only available resource are building bricks. The only commands available are move left / right. pick up/put down and climb (a maximum of one brick only). Using these commands the player must solve the puzzle and get Block-Man to the exit of each room. The shareware game consists of ten levels. The full, registered, game has more levels, and for a further fee a constructor option that allows the player to create and play their own levels and those of other game owners is available .",

The game is designed for two players which both take the side of a war party - in matches of a larger scale one war party can include several different countries. The gameplay is strictly turn-based and every day is divided into six rounds (three for each player). Every turn is divided into three phases: submarines, ships and aircraft. During the phases the players use two different map screens for their planning: the strategic map shows the whole operational zone divided into several areas and the tactical map offers a closer look over one area. The basic orders the players have to give are moving (marking a unit and choosing the goal hex) and attacking (choosing which weapon is used on what target). During longer matches it is also important to take care of replenishment. While naval units have to be moved on the tactical map the players can use the strategic map to plan aircraft movement. As usual for these kind of games everything is represented with abstract symbols on the map. In single player the game features ten scenarios set in the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf with increasing difficulty. There the player takes the role of the American fleet and mostly fights against Russia.",

When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators. Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons: 1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 4) Ouagadougou - Bamako (4438 Km); 5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You'll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you're buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. Finish all 5 stages in a level and you'll be presented with a bonus level.",

There are no walking-on-water shortcuts and in fact, no instances of miraculous behaviour whatsoever. Should you die in combat (a nasty, do-or-die piece of work, often producing apparently random results), do not expect resurrection. Combat? That's right -- despite some scriptural inspiration, a generous helping of Biblical diction and a conversational style heavily influenced by parables, completion of the game demands some distinctly un-Christian behavior: closer to The Last Temptation than to The Passion, the creed of WWJD will be insufficient to successfully guide the player through this game.",

Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one. Absorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat. At 0% power, the game is over - although you may get an option to continue, based on how far you got.",

The castle is an eight-by-eight-by-eight grid, with eight levels containing sixty-four rooms each. Its contents are randomized at the start of each game. There are eight major treasures to seek (including the palintir and the silmaril) and twelve monster types to avoid (from pitiful kobolds to might dragons); players can choose from four different character races (elf, dwarf, man or hobbit) and, with sufficient intelligence, can cast three different spells (web, fireball and deathspell). After picking a race, distributing attribute scores and spending money to gain weapons, armor and other equipment, the player enters the castle. Rooms are portrayed by short textual descriptions and grid numbers showing where they fit into the grand scheme of things. Gameplay consists of typing simple text commands to move, fight and gather treasure. A map is automatically generated during play, but it can only be viewed for a brief moment at a time before it disappears off the screen (even on very slow computers).",

The player's only weapon is a magic wand that can be used to transform objects. The player first uses the wand on any object to acquire a \"wand pattern\", then he can transform anything (walls, ladders, monsters...) into said object. This can be used to create ladders to travel, get rid of monsters etc., though all transformed objects revert to their original form after a while. Some levels feature gray objects which cannot be affected by the wand.",

Gameplay is in an arcade/action style, so you don't need to worry about statistics for different teams or players. The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view of the field, with a small side-viewed window of the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, control automatically goes to the player nearest to the ball, but a point doesn't end until the pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home run). Features include stealing bases, pitching curve balls, or customizing the colors of each team. The game has been presented with considerable glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings and lots of advertising boards and other slogans.",

To do so, the player must hatch, raise, breed dragons, and use them to spread terror and power across the land! Use these dragons and spells to conquer or help numerous villages and cities across the land while devastating the other wizards also seeking control of the land. Dragon Lord introduces different levels of gameplay, which may be categorized as the following:   * Alchemy  The game introduces a complex process of alchemy. Different  ingredients have positive and negative results in combination of  different types of Magick equipment used for it. Use alchemy to  strengthen (or even weaken) own dragons or use them to cast spells  at surrounding villages and cities (as well as some alchemical  spells for the player's own benefit). Creating a too powerful spell  in the Magick Laboratory may introduce an unpleasant explosion in  the lab. Ingredients may be obtained through villager tribute or  purchase from traveling merchants.  Note: The game is almost impossible to play without the Alchemical  Table of Ingredients.   * Dragon Breeding  The player may breed several individual dragons in the castle. Each  require nurturing and patience before they can hatch and even more  so after they hatch! Use alchemy spells to help strengthen the  dragon eggs (or they may not hatch at all!).   * Dragon Missions and Political Map  This feature gives a top-down perspective of the political map  around the land. Send dragons to wreck havoc and terror to the  surrounding villages and cities, or use them to explore the region  and even protect villages and cities from enemy dragons! Attacking  villages and cities may prompt them to surrender themselves under  the player's control, providing the damage done is sufficient  enough. This is also where the player may control the taxation of  villages and cities (under player control) as well as any other  information regarding them.   * Dragon Combat!  Though optional, the player may enter manual combat (as to  automatic combat) and enter a top-down, side-scrolling (vertical)  arcade combat when attacking villages or cities. Here the player  basically uses a dragon to burn anything that remotely looks like a  structure.  Note: If there is an enemy dragon near the area, the enemy dragon  will come to the defense of that village or city!",

Black elves and orcs became his minions. The gods flooded the land in response, secluding the island kingdom of Arborea as the last stronghold against Mogroth's forces. Jarel, the last Prince of the elf-like race of Sham-nirs, must find allies who would help him on his quest to obtain four elemental crystals, restore the power of the temples, and defeat Mogroth. Crystals of Arborea is an RPG which is a precursor to the Ishar games. The party of six characters roam the world (on a 2D map or by exploring 3D individual locations), defeating Mogroth's minions, gathering experience points and becoming stronger. Unlike the subsequent Ishar games, combat in this game is turn-based, and takes place on separate screens. The players must manually navigate party members on the battle field. Archers and spellcasters can use ranged attacks, while melee fighters must stand close to the enemy in order to strike.",

Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically  important places;  2. Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper;  3. Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier;  4. Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French  village.  All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later. Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.",

Up to four managers can join in, to lead their chosen team through the World Cup, from qualifying to the actual tournament. Tactics and training are hugely important due to the game's short time frame. The players each have individual personalities, and these have been factored in during the game. Sometimes players will drink too much, fall in love, or have personality clashes with their team-mates or with you, all of which have to be factored in. The press will ask you loaded questions, so be careful how you answer. At half-time in each match you can single out a particular player for praise or criticism - if the team feels that you were unfair, their performance might fade. The World Cup is emulated accurately, other than having 2 points for a win instead of 3. The colourful match graphics and oil-painted stills are the same in style as those in the League Edition.",

The player controls a little worm named Wally that is constantly and swiftly moving through a room that spawns all kinds of tasty fruits. By guiding the worm left and right the player has to collect the fruits, just to accumulate points and see the creature grow bigger with every catch. While doing so Wally has to avoid trying to eat the walls of the room or its own tail, because eating something wrong will result in the loss of one of his five lives. From time to time there will be moving butterflies spawning that will restore a live once eaten, the player can even acquire more than the five starting lives. Goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible to earn a place in the integrated high score list. So much for the basics, Wurm's gameplay doesn't stay as simple as it first appears. Once the worm's tail has reached a certain length it will suddenly fall off the animal, creating a new non-eatable obstacle in the process. Later on, evil red worms will appear that are either just randomly moving around the screen or are trying to eat the tasty fruits before the player's worm, also growing and losing their tails when successful too often. Next will be flushes of water flooding through the room casting away the creature's valuable food. Then spiders will rope down using their spider silk and creating even more obstacles, flowers growing out of the ground need to be avoided, and so forth.",

Or, despite Infogrames' martial marketing efforts, 7 Colors might just be a puzzle game with brightly colored diamonds. In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov's block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician's concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins. Some quirks add tactical depth: The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure. 7 Colors can be played against the computer or a human opponent, even over a local network - a rare feature at the time. Ambitious players may design their own boards with the included editor.",

To survive, you'll have to blast your way out by darting in and out of the line of fire and taking down the assailants with your own volleys: once they're all eliminated, you go forth to the next level, to face yet another wave. Ammunition is limited, and from time to time you'll have to restock by picking up a fresh supply. Every level contains four bonus crystals: as time goes by, they emerge one-by-one to be picked up, and each is worth twice as much as the last.

The player can change lanes at any time to overtake cars/avoid oncoming traffic. The player's car has two gears and an accelerator but no brakes. Slowing down is achieved by lifting off the gas or shifting down to first gear. There is no limit to the number of times a player can crash into another vehicle (i.e. no 'life' system), however doing so means accelerating again from a standing start, wasting valuable time. The game starts with 60 seconds of time remaining, and points are awarded depending on the distance covered and number of cars passed. For every 10,000 points earnt an extra 60 seconds of time is added to the clock. The game ends when there is no time left on the clock. The game was written entirely in Assembler.",

Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information. This game puts the player in the shoes of a Corps commander--a man responsible for several divisions--for the lives of thousands of men. The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader. In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine. Out in the field, their duty is to carry out orders to the best of their ability. They must try to cope with the unexpected that interferes with their progress--weather, enemies, terrain, fatigue, lack of supplies... Unfortunately, it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the command centers. Commanders don't have a personal connection to each person under them. They rely on those underneath them to report in... This game gives some insight to the problems of command. There are hundreds of units to keep track of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized. The units become symbols on a map-board. Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player sends out. Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control. Will they be able or willing to follow orders exactly? What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by weather, by terrain. Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a division (thousands of men) to their deaths? Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command centers, where the orders that they must follow come from. This game recreates the command center.",

Making life easier is the Tacti-Grid tactics editor, which allowed you to customise tactics by instructing players on exactly where they go when the ball is in a particular position. The editor is the most comprehensive ever seen in an action football game, allowing you to rename players, change their appearance and skills, transfer them across clubs, move clubs around the divisions, change their kits, and more.",

In this simple and short game, the player guides a swimming goldfish with the mouse, carefully moving it around the restrict space of an aquarium to avoid all the environmental dangers and survive a week (with the day cycle occurring every half a minute or so). The available energy for movement and survival is displayed as a green bar at the bottom, slowly depleting when the creature is in motion, when it's exposed to the bright lights at the top for too long or when it stands too close to the heater at the left side. The fish heals when standing motionless and resting under shadows and out of harm's way. A line with a fishing hook keeps moving from one side to the other, capturing the fish automatically when touching it. A small purple fish keeps coming out from the decorative castle model at random intervals, and is capable of swallowing the larger goldfish after touching it.",

Relying on collective group mind and telepathic messages, these creatures have overthrown the dominant race on their home planet, Siria, assimilating their technology. As the planet became uninhabitable, the new Sirians have ventured into deep space, hoping to find a new home. Their goal was to find vertebrate creatures, in which they could lay their eggs; they have chosen the Earth for that reason. To avert this terrible threat, the Fist of Earth organization sends a fighter pilot named Viper to protect the planet, navigating their strongest weapon - the starfighter XF5700 Mantis. XF5700 Mantis Experimental Fighter is a mission-based space combat simulation, and a sequel to Warhead. The game utilizes real space (Newtonian) physics for ship navigation. Mission objectives usually involve eliminating alien ships while protecting Viper's wingmen. The game continues the plot of Warhead in its 90 missions.",

Tankbattle: Work your way across a battlefield to capture the opposing coat of arms to open the exit to the next level. Avoid turrets, bombs, and other obstacles. Lost 'N Maze: Quickly travel through the corridors of the maze until you locate the keys to the exit. Collect various power-ups and bonus points along the way. Diet Riot: Put all the junk food stores out of business by having your man gather all the food crates for each store and throw them in the dumpster. Beware of junk food -- eating it slows you down and threatens you with a heart attack; you can \"work out\" using the exercise equipment to speed back up, as well as eating healthy food. Blockalanche: An isometric-view Tetris clone, with the differences of being able to select your next piece (if you're quick enough) and being only able to rotate your block around one axis. The gameplay options are also quite varied: Each game can be played one player alone, two players alternately, two players simultaneously, or one player against one of three computer personalities -- including split-screen play for head-to-head competition.",

                "plot": "Based on the 1950s TV series of the same name, The Honeymooners is a series of mini-games. Ralph Kramden wants to hold the annual meeting of the Raccoon Lodge at Miami Beach. However the treasury is fairly empty and in order to make his dream come true, the Kramden's and their friends, the Norton's will need to work extra hard and be a little lucky to reach the required amount. But Miami Beach is a popular destination, and the families must hurry before all the hotels are booked. The Honeymooners is really 4 different mini-games for one to four players who compete against one another. The goal is represented by a train car heading towards Miami Beach. The goal is to earn enough points (presumably representing money) to move the train car all the way there. In order to gain points, the player attempts to complete one of the following mini-games:   * No If's, And's or Bus: Ralph Kramden is a bus driver and must pick  up as many passengers and take them to their destinations. The game  is played as an overhead view over a map of steet names and  passangers. The goal is to pick up waiting passangers and deliver  them to the destination they want. The player only controls the  bus's direction (up, down, left, right) and speed. Delivering  passengers earns points but leaving passengers on the bus will lose  points. Hitting other traffic or returning to the bus depot will  end the game.   * Sewer I Do: Ed Norton works for the sewer company and has a map of  the tunnels' layout. However his map has blown away so he must  navigate the sewers from memory, fixing leaks and eventually  returning to his ladder. The game is played in first-person 3D maze  with the player being able to move forward, back and rotate left  and right.   * Going to Pieces: Alice Kramden works at a department store and is  talking to Trixie when she drops a jig-saw puzzle. The player must  reassemble the image before time runs out.   * Additionally, \"The $99,000 Answer\" is Ralph's favorite game show,  sometimes appears at the end of mini-games as a double-or-nothing  bonus round. Players must answer trivia questions related to The  Honeymooners TV show. However game shows are all about luck and  sometimes the player will win or lose randomly without a question  being asked.",

In the first game, the player needs to recreate a stone combination shown in the lower part of the screen. To do so, he places a single stone on the playfield. However, each stone also has a value between one and four which needs to be matched. Every time a stone is placed besides another stone, the value of the stone already on the field rises by one. If the value was already four, it resets to one. In the second game, a pre-defined stone combination has to be erased. To do so, the player clicks on a stone which then disappears. But the stones around the clicked stone (left, right, above and below) also disappear. If there is no stone on a clicked place or a place around it, one is created. In the third game, the goal is the same as in game two. However, only two stones of the same value and colour can be taken from the playfield.

There are savage wars over the resources that remain and the air reeks of death, disease & decay. The good news is that science has discovered a new kind of crystal, Alchemite, that can be refined into any substance known to man. The player takes on the role of a would be rockhopper, a person who mines the remains of nearby systems for this material. Each player has a paddle which moves left / right. The players also have three lives, each life being represented by a ball that rests on their paddle. On the screen are bricks, arranged differently on each level. Some bricks are unbreakable, some break immediately, others after two or more strikes with the ball. The player must fire their ball at the bricks and, when it bounces back, the player must position their paddle to catch their ball causing it to bounce up towards the bricks again. Failure to catch a ball costs a life. When a brick breaks it scores points and sometimes scatters small blue crystals or paddle power-ups. Each brick destroyed and each crystal caught increases the players score. The objective is to score as many points as possible by clearing all the bricks in a level, collecting the crystals they release in the process, before progressing to the next level. In a two player mode each player's paddle and ball are a different colour. The game installs in both English and German. The shareware game consists of ten levels and the full game has over one hundred.",

Still with me? Torn at devising a suitably torturous punishment for them, Stumpy installs them into electric chairs with joysticks, forcing them on pain of electric shock to duke it out by remotely controlling a highly-creative assortment of champions... who attempt to direct a ball (in actuality a severed human head) past each other into their opponent's goal zone, getting an edge on the opponent by amassing power and timing the use of their most inventive, violent and repulsive special attacks. All the while, Stumpy hurls devastating insults at his captives, who exchange sophomoric verbal barbs with each other depending on their performance in the game. The intersection of Pong and Mortal Kombat turned out to be surprisingly tame compared to this gutsy and visceral contender (more Pong-meets-Time Killers, the fighting game that tracked dismemberments and decapitations as well as wins and losses), but not only is this paddle-and-ball game surprisingly solid (considering that its gameplay is obviously not its primary selling point), it may have a good shot at the title of Most Offensive Game ever due to excessive gore and vulgarity.",

Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches!

In Dinky's House, the child player has to click on the closed windows of the character's house, trying to find him behind the curtains. Clicking on the door icon shows the house interior, where clicking on furniture and other parts of the scenery shows an animation of Dinky doing something. In Guess-o-Matic, the player has to find the drawing displayed at the bottom, by clicking on a series of cards with question marks. In Barber Joe, the child can select from three head drawings of a boy called Joe, a girl named Jane and the dog Woof to paint over with the available drawing tools at the left side of the screen. In Alphabeeps, the kid has to click on the first letter from the name of the object, animal or thing shown at the top of the screen. As a reward and incentive for correct answers, an animated monster gets closer to an object, hopping across the screen until finally reaching and interacting with it. In Too Many Monsters, the top of the screen shows a group of monsters, and the child has to click on the corresponding number of them at the bottom.",

The game plays almost as a multiple-choice test on the Jolly Roger's Cookbook, with player input restricted to selecting from a psychedelically-coloured text list how he or she intends to ruin various innocuous activities associated with the show, such as snack time (by injecting the orange with vodka, perhaps?), singing a song together (while substituting in obscene new lines) or visiting the zoo (and selling kids into slavery or feeding Baby Bop to an alligator while there.) (While taking the kids to a GWAR concert is undeniably subversive, it does strain the suspension of disbelief.) The player is given regular status reports on the current state (of health and sobriety) of all the kids on the show; the ultimate goal is to render the entire cast unfit to perform further by the end of a week's worth of infiltrated episodes, following which the player may get to gather huge bonus points in an endgame sequence where Barney is fought to the death in a shopping mall. Though the gameplay is single-player, as a BBS door game callers would compete with each other for showings on the high-score table; in later versions of the software, dedicated fans were also granted the opportunity to submit scripted modules consisting of new, further deranged anti-social activities to run the kids through.",

(But what's the fun in that?) The commands are very simple. The player either buys or sells stock, pays for information, gets reports, and, if caught, cooperates with the SEC or destroys evidence. Cooperating means an automatic fine, but he can continue playing. If he does nothing, there's a small chance they'll drop the charges, but if they don't he'll pay a higher fine. If he destroys evidence, there's a slight better chance of getting off scott-free, but getting caught means jail time and the end of the game.",

In this version, you can control how many different block shapes are available in your game. These are grouped in block sets - Standard has the typical number you are used to seeing in other Tetris games; Extended adds a few more to that; and Professional which provides a total of 15 different blocks. After choosing a set, you will be asked which \"zone\" (screen) you wish to start playing. Unregistered players are limited to 10 zones, while the Registered release contains over 50 different screens",

Successfully slamming from a higher altitude will turn the pterodactyls into eggs, which may bounce away, as well as award the player with points. Additional points may be gathered by collecting these eggs. The game is divided into different rounds which will introduce more challenges: additional pterodactyls, which will spawn at any one of the eight green spawning areas; the lower ground will disappear and introduce wind current affecting the gravitational velocity of all moving objects in the game; the default six platforms may also change into fewer platforms; and an indestructible dragon may occasionally appear, resulting in instant death when collided with.",

                "plot": "Eamon was one of the earliest role-playing games available for the Apple II. It was also perhaps the first ever adventure game construction set. The game was public domain, so it was mainly distributed in Apple user groups and by trading with friends. The main game consists of the Eamon Master disk, which has the Main Hall and a short adventure called the Beginner's Cave. You start the game in the Main Hall, where you create a new character or select an old character. You are able to buy weapons, spells, and armor and go on your adventure. Weapons come in five different types: Axe, Bow, Mace, Spear, and Sword. There are three types of armor: Leather, Chain, and Plate. There are also several spells: Blast, a damage spell; Power, which has random effects, Heal, which cures you; and Speed, which increases your chance to hit. Character development is fairly simple. Your character starts with random stats in three categories: Hardiness (how much you can carry and the amount of damage you can take), Agility (How good you are in combat) and Charisma (Affects the costs of items in the store and the friendliness of monsters). You also has percentage ratings for each of the weapon types that determine, along with the armor penalty, whether you can hit or not. These percentage ratings have a chance of going up every time you hit a monster with that type of weapon. The game is entirely text-based, though the construction set allows the addition of graphics. You interact with the environment typing simple one or two-word game commands such as ATTACK RAT, INVENTORY, or NORTH. There is no option to save your game, so death is often quick, sudden, and final.",

Instead of clearing the path to a portal for green creatures, the player controls a green duck, the leader of oranges ducks that must be guided to a rocket ship. Clicking and holding the right mouse button on any place of the gamefield makes the leader move towards it. When the green duck is close enough to the orange ducks, they start to follow it. Moving the mouse while holding down the button makes the green duck change direction accordingly. The rocket ship has a number on top, indicating the number of ducks necessary for it to take off. Numerous hazards scattered through the levels kill the ducks. Instead of Lemmings' more aseptic approach to violence, deaths on Ducks are quite gory, with the animals exploding and their blood splattering on nearby surfaces. A slimy monster wanders some levels and devours the birds, and they can also be murdered by spikes, fans, electric bolts and long falls. Switches turn off and on the electric arcs, but can only be activated by the leader, and only once per level. The ESC button makes them commit suicide, useful to quit a level made unsolvable by wrong actions. Several tools help to clear the path to the rocket. They appear as icons at the bottom of the screen, and can be changed with the arrow key and deployed with the left mouse button. The bomb explodes the scenery, removing chunks of it each time. Horizontal bridges and diagonal ladders help the ducks to cross safely over chasms and dangerous environments. The balloon acts like the bomb, but it goes upwards instead of falling. Stop signs makes the orange ducks stop their march, instead of walking toward deathly devices and places. Bricks can be placed on top of each other, to manually construct bridges. The teleport transports the leader anywhere in the level. Seagulls and flying saucers replace the leader, guiding the birds and moving automatically from one side to the other (the saucer goes up and down as well). There's a level editor available as an optional download on the developer site.",

Skunny shall get back the sheep that have been stolen from the farm of Skunny's parents back in 1909. Skunny: In The Wild West is a shareware platform game with ten levels in which all stolen sheep have to be freed. To reach this goal Skunny has to jump from platform to platform, cross seas or abysses and protect himself from hostile animals and persons with his weapon, a water pistol. While some enemies disappear permanently after being shot, others appear again after a short period of time. Getting hit or touched by an enemy results in losing energy and sooner or later in losing one of the four lives; falling down a platform Skunny loses a life immediately. Then he has to restart from the beginning of the level or a savepoint. In this case all already saved sheep are still saved but all enemies are back. Skunny can pick up water for his pistol, items that restore his health and can carry a box. He can put it down wherever he wants and use it to jump to higher platforms. In the shareware version allows play of only the first two levels. By registering all ten levels can be played, there are more enemies and cheat codes can be used.",

You can turn a few of these on and off.

                "plot": "International Athletics is an arcade track & field game by the Spanish developer True Emotions. It was initially published by Opera Soft in Spain in 1992 under the title Olympic Games '92, then licensed by Zeppelin in 1993 for their \"International\" series of sports simulations. International Athletics consists of eight events, grouped in three basic categories:   * Running - 100m, 110m hurdles   * Jumping - Long Jump, High Jump, Triple Jump   * Throwing - Javelin, Shot Putt, Discus  Rather than the traditional rhythmic key tapping or joystick rattling of the Decathlon offspring, International Athletics requires only timing, with most events mastered with only two key presses. To run the 100 meters for instance, you hit the action key once to get your athlete started, then adjust his target speed on a slider. Once that's done, you lean back and watch him race to the finishing line. Events such as triple jump and 110m hurdles require several accurately times keystrokes in order to succeed. In general, mastering the events and even setting new world records is a matter of only one or two repeats. Practice mode lets you exercise your timing, competition mode plays through all eight events in set order. If you fail to meet the qualification requirement on one event, you are out instantly. Up to four players can compete on one PC in split-screen mode. The game's presentation is thin, with digitized photos of the eight events as the main eye-candy and a complete lack of atmospheric stadium sequences, ceremonies or national anthems; in this respect, International Athletics doesn't even meet the standards set by Summer Games and Epyx' other late-80s sports classics. Options include three difficulty levels, changing wind and different weather conditions, which are not visually represented but affect the achievable event result. Likely one of the most esoteric options seen in a track & field game so far is the possibility to activate doping. This doesn't mean that players can actively dope their athletes, but they may fail random doping checks after each event, which results in immediate disqualification - essentially a form of Russian Roulette.",

A second hyperspace booster has been found, so there is hope that communication with Earth will be re-established in the foreseeable future. Still, the situation in the Local Group is tense. Two rival governments have formed: The Federated Worlds and the United Democratic Planets. Currently, travel and trade between the two is ongoing, but everyone fears the tensions will lead to all-out war. The player takes the role of an undercover operative for the Federated Worlds. Disguised as a free trader from Vromus Prime, they will have to earn a living for themselves, because the FW only gives out money or equipment for special missions. As in the original game, there are many ways of spending one's time and earning credits in the Local Cluster. Trade, exploration, passenger or freight transport, mining, smuggling, bounty hunting or piracy are among the many options. Several different ships are available for purchase, each suited to different tasks. Some may have more room for mining equipment or cargo, others for weapons systems. Ships are highly customizable, with dozens of different models available for the likes of FTL and sub-light drives, energy converters, bridge and crew modules, computers, medical and communications systems, life support, scanners and more. Each part varies in damage it can take, size required for installing, visibility factor (highly visible parts are more likely to be hit in an attack) and sophistication (highly sophisticated parts can only be serviced and repaired in special drydocks). A ship also requires a crew, and this is one area where Universe II differs from its predecessor: crew management is now much more complex, and comparable to a role-playing game. Crew members have one of seven specialties: captain, astrogator, gunner, pilot, miner, marine and engineer. Specialists are required for most tasks - without a miner mining is impossible, marines are required for man-to-man combat, only engineers can repair the ship's systems, et cetera. Crew members gain experience automatically with time, but can also be trained at a technical school in exchange for the right number of credits. They must also be fed, paid and require sleep. Their salary increases with experience. If there is no pay day for a while, they leave, whereas a lack of provisions naturally leads to starvation. The sleep requirements are simulated by assigning crew members to a watch cycle. A process called asomnigenation can eliminate the need for sleep in astrogators and gunners. Another difference from the original game is a more detailed simulation of combat: when boarding an enemy ship, the player's marines must now capture the bridge by either killing all enemy marines or capturing 30% of the control panels. When deploying assault capsules to mine from an unwilling planet, any defense stations must be destroyed first. These combat engagements take place on special tactical screens. Another new feature comes into play when docking at a starport: these sections are played in the manner of text adventures, utilizing a text parser. The bases can be freely explored, characters can be talked to, and valuable items and clues be found. Universe II does away with the text-based interface of the original game, and (other for the text adventure parts) uses a menu-based window system not unlike the contemporary GEM or Macintosh interfaces.",

Unfortunately she has a new plan: travelling to the future (2200) when Cirion is long dead. Of course he pursues her and now his quest of defeating Medusa begins anew. This time the main goal is finding thirteen keys which are divided over dungeons all over the country. The change of scenario, the predecessor was set in medieval times, means that there is modern weaponry and technology. In order to find the keys, the player needs to build up an army and gather enough money to search for them and defeat Medusa's city. There are several ways to do this, the most important being trade. Other options are searching for treasure on the world map or playing roulette at a casino. Important for success is the assembly of the army as there are multiple races, classes and weaponry to choose from. The main addition in comparison to the predecessor are the dungeons which are shown from a first person-view. The player can take up to three companions into those dungeons and needs to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in real-time (ranged with firearms) in order to reach the goal. The game is also in real-time when travelling on the world map; only inside the cities where the management part takes place the time is stopped. There is also the occasional arcade sequence to solve.",

The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy. In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.",

The player can practice any maneuver in the simulator: dozens of high, low and flat maneuvers, Diamond 360 passes, left rolls and 4-point rolls or an entire air show for example. Other than practice events, the player can perform an air show or just go for a free flight. In the air, players fly from a 1st person perspective inside the plane or a 3rd person perspective from a chase plane behind the player. Additionally there are 4 different camera views and 3 different gameplay speeds. After the flight, an analysis is displayed of the flight and the player's performance graded.",

AUTS (Finnish for \"ouch\") is a 2-4 player side scrolling game on split screen, where players control V-shaped space ships and try to destroy each other with bullets and a secondary equipped gun that can be chosen from an arsenal of two dozen imaginative weapons. Players can recharge their energy and switch weapons on landing pads spread throughout the levels. Levels were bitmap images with a key-color which indicated a space where the ships can fly. A dedicated color from the palette for water was also included, but water didn't flow as in some more modern cave fliers (like in Wings). Players were able to construct new levels with a tool that converted bitmap images into a format understood by the game.",

It is one of the oldest games of this family, originating in 1981 on DEC mainframes. The story is quite conservative: As in the other Wizard's Castle games, your task is to descend into a dungeon to find the all-powerful Globe of some mighty Warlock on the deepest level. The gameplay is a hybrid of boardgame-like exploration and roguelike dungeon crawl, the whole presented as in \"windowed\" interactive fiction game, while the setting is a mix of fantasy, horror and sci-fi elements, playing in a haunted mansion filled with dust, bones, undead skeletons, RAM chips needed for auto-mapping, Uzis and Laser guns, etc. The only graphics is the BGI title screen; the rest of the game plays in text mode and reminds late DOS applications with windows. There is only one kind of monster that you'll encounter: skeletons of all shapes and sizes: paper skeletons, flying skeletons, paranoid skeletons, closet skeletons, thief skeletons, and so on. You can fight them, but you can also try to talk to them, which may save hit points and also provide some information. Items are strewn in the castle waiting to be found by you. As in an adventure, you need to examine the room to find them, getting a vague description. To actually get the item, you need to guess what it is. For example, instead of saying \"gold\", you're told that you see \"round disks\". In extreme cases, items are just described as \"something\". Besides the usual gold and jewels, there are also some more esoteric items. Beside your bare hands, the most common weapons are bones. These, however, are easily dropped during a fight; swords and maces are more efficient, but the most powerful weapons are lasers or the legendary Uzi. Naturally, lasers require energy and Uzi needs ammo clips to work, which are hard to identify in the general trash lying around. You can also find explosives, or spell books useful for casting spells. The game incorporates a mapping system called \"Bonebuster Mansion Mapper\". Auto-mapping is inherent in Wizard's Castles gameplay, but here, it is not automatic: the mapper needs Video RAM to display something, and it needs Main RAM to store information. So in order to enable auto-mapping, you need to find (and identify) as much RAM chips as you can. Each K of RAM can only display or store one room, and chips aren't abundant either in a haunted mansion full of skeletons, so just like in reality, you'll be constantly running out of RAM. Finally, there are also nasty traps, like rooms filled with poison gas in which you begin to suffocate. These rooms only have one-way doors, so in order to leave them, you'll have to use your weapons to hammer the wall open, which takes time.",

You must command the knights of the kingdom to find and destroy the vile beast. The gameplay takes place in seven acts or episodes and features a mix of RPG and simple strategy game (for combat) elements. The game world itself is loosely based on medieval Spain, and features dozens of towns, cities, and castles. Traveling from location to location takes place on an overhead map, while each actual location consists of picturesque hand-painted backdrops depicting the type of environment it is set in. The interface is entirely mouse-driven (although keyboard short-cuts are also present), iconic, and streamlined to make it accessible to inexperienced game players.",

In order to solve the case, you will need to find enough evidence to accuse the correct person. Clues can be found by searching the various rooms, and also from interrogating the fifteen passengers on board. When you come across a passenger, you can question them by being polite, forceful, naive, or whatever approach you think will get you the most information. You can even ignore passengers, but ignoring someone now may make them reluctant to help you later! By piecing the evidence together you need to come up with the killer before time runs out. You may play the game as one of eight different detectives. Each time you play, the killer, his/her motive, and the various clues will be different.",

As first action, we will have the possibility of training with the Dummies (the wood men), where we will practice the distance, the speed and the use of complementary techniques. From which we will get up ourselves into the dynamics of the fight and the confrontations hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer. The movements are varied, all of them based on the Kung-Fu techniques. With different arms we will be able to execute different movements using the same keys.

Your task on each level is to clear a path for Kaf-E, your girlfriend, to be able to progress to the heart of the Dreamtrack HQ, getting past each of the myriad of security systems they have built up. A map must be used to navigate the route through the systems, with lots of information readily available. The basic gameplay sees you darting through 3D tunnels using the mouse, and is like a prototype Descent, with your ship kitted out with cannons and missiles, with each enemy better dealt with by one or the other. As well as ensuring your own survival, you must guide Kaf-E through the levels by blasting out the correct sections to clear a path for her. As she has no intelligence, and simply walks into walls, this element can be compared to Lemmings.",

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy. There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example). The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.",

This athlete can be saved to disk and further improved during the course of time. For exhibition matches, the opponent can be built the same way. The game includes various hit types, depending on the player's position and timing. The direction of the ball can also be influenced when performing a shot.

The player scores one point for every stomping anvil crossed and loses one point for every one they run into. The game has nine levels of difficulty and records the top ten scores for each level. As the level of difficulty increases the stompers pound faster, there are more spiders and Martians who move faster too. The game is entirely controlled via the keyboard. The numeric keypad is used to move the players character and the function keys are used to configure the game, change difficulty, toggle sound on/off etc.",

In a grassroots simulation of industrial production and allocation, players balance a country's military and social spending to survive in an environment of fictitious nations competing for land and resources. Key element in the turn-based The Global Dilemma is a basic tree of industries such as coal mines, lumber mills or gunpowder factories. The entire production chain culminates in only two results: an increase in either military strength or population. Guns or butter. The careful balancing and channelling of the industrial production, stripped down to the most basic mechanics, is The Global Dilemma's fundamental challenge. A growing worker population is vital for the economy. A strong military is vital for conquering neighboring provinces, their resources and population. At the same time, rivalling countries threaten the borders, and troops must be deployed to the vulnerable spots on the map. Superiority in numbers wins the abstract clashes of armies. The expert difficulty level adds a diplomacy system in which nations form short-term economic alliances. The Global Dilemma sees Crawford refine his particular brand of socio-global simulations, reducing complex issues to basic cause-and-effects chains that have a distinctly educative edge. As usual, a well-written manual details the game's mechanics. Crawford continued with Balance of the Planet (1990).",

You can play either the Allies or the Russians, and choose either a computer opponent or play against another human player. Orders can be given in two modes - 'Unit Mode' where you can give orders to individual units or 'Group Mode', where you can give orders to groups of up to 8 units. Units are represented in the game as animated soldier miniatures, allowing you to select and change groups to five different types of line, column and square formations.",

The game contains 256 rooms, which the player explores while in search of 16 crystals and 16 cubes. The Mobile bounces from platform to platform, making its way around the room to the doors that lead into other rooms. On the way, the player encounters many other creatures and vehicles, as well as surprises, such as rooms with reversed gravity. There are two modes of play: Emotion and Action.   * In Action, players start in the central room, and work their way  around with a time limit. Players gain time when going into a room  they haven't been in before, and when crystal or cube power-ups are  picked up. When time runs out, the Mobile explodes and the game  ends.   * In Emotion, players can choose to start in any of the 12 regions  into which the 256 rooms are grouped. The regions are arranged in  the context of different areas of the human brain. While there is  no timer, players also can't explore beyond the region that is  chosen.",

Snowball: As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong! Return to Eden: Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.

After starting the game, you see the map where the action takes place -- a top-down view of 180,000 acres of forested coastland somewhere in the Northwest, containing mountains and hills, roads and buildings, rivers and a lake. You now start with setting up the situation, placing up to five fires and initializing the wind direction. Both may be done randomly by the computer or manually by you. After pressing the GO button the real action begins: The fires start to slowly spread out, influenced by wind and terrain, and you have to control your four fire crews and two air tankers to prevent it. The fire crews can be used to cut fire-lines in the forests, preventing fire propagation, but you first have to move them near the fire, so be sure to let your ground crew use the roads. The two air tankers at your disposal can drop lines of fire retardants which will also stop the fire's progression. After dropping the retardants, the air units have to get back to their respective base for refueling, which takes some time. You can pause the simulation at any time to think about your next move. The game is highly configurable -- you can change the speed of fire crews, air units and of the fire, and you can select the air units' refueling and their retardants' drop time before starting the game. Wind parameters can be switched from manual to automatic anytime during the game. The game is entirely mouse-controlled. Firestorm turns out to be a simple, yet realistic and immersive simulation of fighting forest fires, requiring rapid decision and strategic skill.",

It simulates the North Africa Campaign in 1941-42 commencing with the arrival of Rommel in Tripoli and ends with the Battle of El Alamein. The bitter campaign includes Operations Battleaxe and Crusader and the Battle of Gazala. The game is named after the men of the 7th Armoured Division who were known as the Desert Rats after adopting a 'gerbil' as their insignia. Several versions like DOS and ZX Spectrum 128K includes two additional scenarios: Operation Compass and the Battle of Beda Fomm (December 1940-February 1941). The gameplay is shown on a scrolling map by turns. Players select the units and give them orders to hold position, move to, fortify, or assault. Units move on the grid of rectangular cells. The balance of battles may be adjusted by Malta Status (Historical, Operation Hercules, Not used as base) as well. Historically, Montgomery defeated Rommel at El Alamein, and it is player's opportunity to alter the history making it sooner or vice versa. The game is accompanied by a detailed instruction booklet including historical background notes of the campaign with maps and photographs. Two players representing Allied and Axis may be computer or human.",

Steal card, Force Swap among players or pass your trash either left or right are examples of the effects of a Luck Card. Each player must draw a Luck card at the beginning of their turn. The game allows you to choose among 10 different types of robots to use in your hunt, each with their own personality and style. You must also mind the type of terrain you wander into, because some types may damage your robot.

Each player controls one color of balls--either red or green. Like checkers, the game board is an eight-by-eight grid. Unlike checkers's squares, though, Funball's bases don't just passively accept balls. Bases can change a ball's size, teleport it, spring it further along, cause it to slide past rather than land, or have numerous other effects--there are thirteen different types of bases. The arrangement of the different kinds of bases isn't always the same, either. When starting a new game, the player can choose from five different preset boards, or use the board editor to create a custom board. Not only are there different types of bases, the balls themselves can be different sizes. The relative sizes of the balls determines the outcome of an attack, and can have other effects, depending on the target base. In addition to the balls, the board can contain a spider, which moves around the board each turn, and can lay eggs that balls can absorb to grow larger. The game can be played against the computer, or against a friend in hotseat mode.",

They will face not only each other, but also famine, plague, civil war, insurrection, and earthquakes. To win, each player will build cities and fleets; do battle; form alliances; produce grain, metal, and trade goods; and barter. Players must also choose a \"basis of law\" (Theocracy, Oligarchy, Utopia, or Khanate). This choice will affect consumption rates, production, and battle strength. It can also affect the probability and/or severity of the various disasters. Khanates are nomadic raiders and have some slightly different rules from the other types. Although the game is turn-based as far as each player giving movement commands, the execution of the commands is random. After all players have entered their commands, the computer executes them in a random order. In some cases, this can prevent another player's orders from being carried out. In addition to the main game, players can also choose from two shorter scenarios. The first is called Imperium. In it, players just build cities and fleets and do not trade. The winner is the player who defeats the others in battle. The second scenario is Traders. In this game, there is no movement or battle, just trade. The first player to accumulate 1000 trade points wins.",

Champions of Zulula: Elite Edition is an expanded version of OSP's earlier Champions of Zulula. It is a slightly different take on the fighter genre with 24 different playable character types, several unique boss enemies, and multiple modes. Gameplay is somewhat simplistic with each character type having attacks, a jump, and a block. Arenas can hold up to four combatants at once, with each character being capable of moving on both the x- and y- axes. Gameplay modes include one-on-one fights (against computerized or other players), a tournament mode, the 20 Monsters Bash, and special boss fights. The game also contains many offbeat elements such as bizarre playable creatures and quirky dialogue.",

As missions are successfully completed you earn points based on how successful the mission was, and with increasing points you can advance in rank, from deck mopper up to admiral. Your performance on one mission won't have an affect on future ones, and you can choose to play missions out of order as well. Several missions include other craft you can control to help out (both ships and helicopters). A time compression mode is included, which can be used to reduce the amount of time waiting to arrive at a destination, or even left on to make the action sequences more challenging.",

There are eight types of pieces with special abilities, such as splitting or absorbing the laser beam. Basically most of the pieces are covered with mirrors reflecting the laser beam. Laser piece fires a laser beam in a straight line into a mirror piece placed opposite. The laser beam reflected by the mirror moves forward until it hits another mirror (including opponent's one), wall (beam disappears), absorbing piece (beam disappears) or destructible piece (including own one). The king and the laser have no mirror protection, some of the other pieces are protected only on the selected sides and the diagonal piece can't be destroyed by a laser beam, because all of its surfaces are reflective.

Only a small group of high-tech soldiers under the command of the charismatic Captain Power battles the nemesis and his band of Bio Dread henchmen. None of this matters in the game though. Instead, you launch into two space shooter sequences. Part one, the training mission, has you destroy three Dread drones in a cockpit-view shooting range. Part 2, the Attack on Volcania, is a 2D sidescroller in which you eliminate approaching enemy spaceships. If enough hostiles have died, you get to bomb the enemy lair. The ship-shooting / hideout-bombing sequences are repeated until the fortresses shields are finally down.

Coordinating supplies of both leaves a bit of money left over for research & development, which may yield one-time dividends or permanently lower some costs -- if not necessarily paying for itself except on a long-term scale. Random events in the business world may find their way to the player's desk, arbitrarily benefiting or penalizing their company -- some ~25 events in the original TRS-80 BASIC listing, increased to over 65 in the MS-DOS BASICA version. All of this is a sideshow to the main business of winning contracts to build bridges. To even be considered for eligibility the player's company must have all necessary elements ready to go. Then there is a gentle art to a winning bid, striking some point on a Laffer curve not too high to be accepted but not too low to yield significant profits. Random factors are tempered with general rules, such as the documentation's suggestion to \"Make note that usually the more expensive bridges will mean bigger costs, hence you are capable of making larger bids, and therefore make larger profits.\" Once the player successfully amasses $500 million in profits, they are declared chairman of the board and the game concludes. Much more likely, however, is falling into bankruptcy, which ends the game a whole different way.",

Seven types of tiles are convex combinations of the right-angled triangles. The tiles are moved to you on the belt of conveyor. To successfully finish the level you may dump the unnecessary tiles (up to 50) which do not fit in the places and take the limited space on the conveyor belt. Placing the tiles in all places of specific types will clear the conveyor belt. Time is counting and allows you to make the best time on the level. Completing each puzzle successfully will give you the fixed amount of money and unsuccessfully will take this amount from you. These amounts may show you how difficult the puzzle is and how fast the conveyor belt will move. Logging in the game with certain name you begin your career.

In Adventure Mode you have 3 lives at start and may gain another ones by scoring 500 points while in other modes you have infinite number of lives.

First of all, you have to mow the entire lawn in a certain time. Furthermore, you earn money for mowing, and the less time you need, the more you earn. To save time, you can change the mowing speed, but be careful: if you go too fast, you'll hit some things not intended to mow, thereby getting a time penalty and damaging the mower. After ten \"hits\", you must replace the blades of the mower by returning to the starting shed. The whole thing is further complicated by different obstacles. A gopher appears randomly and leaves holes, and at advanced levels, a dog begins to chase you -- all destroy your mower on touch. Every destroyed mower costs you 10 dollars, and you only have a limited number of mowers at your disposition. The first levels may seem easy, but don't get fooled: it soon gets pretty hard. The game ends when all your mowers are gone, and if mowed well enough, you get the possibility of getting into a high score list.",

Undaunted he dons his SCUBA gear and goes in search of the fish needed for the dish and hence his restaurant. On screen are fish swimming in pockets of water. Around them is either earth, mud or stone. Bluppo can travel through the earth but not through stone, though some stones can be blown up with bombs. Hazards include falling rocks, bombs, exploding fish, sharks and other nasties but there are friendly fish who will eat Bluppo's enemies if given the chance and some levels have additional oxygen tanks to prolong the game play. To complete a level Bluppo must collect the number of fish specified at the bottom of the screen and enter the exit gate. If Bluppo has not collected the correct number of fish, say because one died, then he will not be allowed to enter the exit gate and he will perish. All puzzles are timed and last as long as Bluppo's oxygen. There are six save game slots. The registered game has 60 one player levels, 60 two player levels, and Soundblaster support.",

The game includes a series of gameplay options to modify and create your own game modes. You can select the size of the kingdom, the amount of territory to be explored, the chances of random events, and there's even an option that makes the game a race against the clock as you try to get the kingdom before the rightful heir returns.

Besides the overall graphical improvements, this version adds small touches like random weather and other special effects. The player assumes the role of Eric, a school student in a desperate quest to erase a disastrous report file from the director's computer. The teachers and other fellow students are shown moving about on a scrolling side-view of the building, where the player has to guide the main character to the classes and make him attend and perform other chores from the daily routine. The protagonist can interact with the environment and cause mischief, write messages on the available blackboards, punch the other kids making them fall flat on their backs, and shoot pebbles at distracted teachers with a slingshot. Eric must hit the shields decorating the many rooms of the building to retrieve the password for the headmaster's computer, where the report file is stored. After being caught doing any transgression, he receives a random number of lines as punishment, with 10000 as the maximum allowed before being expelled from the school. Most of the children are anonymous characters milling around the location, but some have names and personalities that can hinder progress. Angelface is the local bully that sometimes contracts mumps, infecting Eric if he crosses path with him and causing the end of the game, as the sick boy is sent home by one of the teachers. Einstein is a snitch, telling the teachers about any misbehavior he witnessed.",

But as increasing numbers of drones start bouncing around the playing area it becomes increasingly difficult to keep your ship safe. You are aided in your attempts by the ships invaluable quad directional auto cannon. The game play is unique in that moving and firing is independently controlled by four keys each.

Initially the bomb has a very limited range, and only one bomb can be placed at the same time. However when destroying breakable blocks, power-ups may appear. The most common power-ups is extending the range of your bombs, and the increasing the supply of bombs. Other power-ups include freezing all monsters, gaining increased speed, becoming invisible.

Spellcraft: Aspects of Valor is a strategy game based on spell creation and large-scale battles. Creating spells is a complicated process that involves finding components (powders, stones, jewels, etc.), mixing them according to a formula, and saying the magic word. Using a wrong formula will result in the player character's death. Besides the traditional attack and defense spells, the player can also create magic that modifies the terrain, and summon creatures that fight on the protagonist's side.",

Travelling isn't free of course so on the way you must do odd jobs to earn money to travel with car, bus, or airplane. Of course travelling with car or plane is the fastest but they're also the costliest. You've gotta take into account how much time you still have to solve the mystery otherwise you might have to ask your bosses for an extension. You have about eight chances to extend your deadline but each extension takes away a bonus point. Use your time wisely and accept jobs that pay the highest for the least amount of days to get to your destination. You should also remember to chart your travels accordingly, say if for example, you have to travel to capital cities so that you don't end up back-tracking and wasting time and money. Once at your destination you can click investigate and search different locales for clues or answers. There are also random events that happen such as radio call-in shows where if you get the right answer you can earn some cash. Sometimes your actions can have dire consequences such as buying counterfeit goods or trying to help feral cats. These incidents can cost you money and or time to undo. Once the clues are all found you will collect a reward based on the time it took and the extensions you used up. Sometimes your job isn't just to solve mysteries however, on occasion you will just have to run some random errands for your bosses such as the mission that you get as a tutorial. Other tools available to you on your quests are a notepad which generates important notes on its own and a database which you can use to search for keywords you think up of on your missions.

The player travels through Quilinor fighting goblins, giants, zombies, and other assorted monsters while emptying the pockets of innocent civilians, getting treasure from dungeons, and picking locks off castles doors. Visually and in terms of basic gameplay, the game is very similar to Ultima V, though with much simpler gameplay mechanics and interaction possibilities. The hero travels over the top-down world map, enters towns marked as icons, and engages in free-movement tile-based combat that occurs on special screens, against enemies who are visible on the map before contact is initiated. Character creation, however, has little to do with Ultima: the player assigns the more traditional AD&D-like attributes to the protagonist, and also chooses skills, which range from combat proficiencies to lockpicking.",

Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight. In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves.

Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though. The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well. To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've already done). Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.",

When you approach the edge of a platform, you do not fall off - rather, you begin walking upside-down on the other side! Instead of jumping, you \"reverse the gravity\" of your croc, causing him to fall up or down until he lands on a platform. You goal on each level is to light up all the bulbs by bumping them with your head. If you hit the bulb three times it will be completely lit up. Some bulbs are invisible on higher levels. There are also foes who want to stop you and who sabotage your efforts by bumping into the bulbs you've lit, turning them off. Your foes can walk on both sides of the platforms just as you and can jump from platform to platform just as you, so watch out! The game can be played by 2 players, so if you are Funk then your friend is Punk and you can challenge each other in scores.",

You have the spark of Elemental Powers and dangerous tool and illegal, unless one is a priest of the Cult of Wisdom. Your father sends you off to learn under the guidance of an elementalist, hoping you would not suffer the same fate as your grandfather, who was hunted down by the Cult for not becoming a priest. The elementalist eluded the Cult by living far from large towns and cities. He was forgotten by the cult. Your father hoped you would be forgotten as well. And now you return... Aleshar: The World of Ice is a top-down perspective role-playing game (RPG) in a world surrounded by snow and ice. Your character may be created from various available classes (hunter, healer, bard, etc.), each with different specialty statistics which may be tweaked during character creation. Character statistics and abilities will increase during the game, depending on constant use of a particular ability. There are no leveling-ups or experience normally found in other RPGs. The world of ice is divided into two major areas:  1. The overland map, where you can encounter (random) monsters and  visit towns, dungeons and caves. Here you can initiate hunting  actions to acquire rations and use the sextant to identify your  location. Time setting on the overland map is real-time, thus  random monster encounters may issue even though your character is  not moving.  2. The tactical map where you commence combat and/or interact with  people (when entering towns). Interacting with people involves a  text parser where you enter keywords (e.g. name, job, buy/sell,  etc.) for further dialogs. Certain keywords are automatically  highlighted.  Combat occurs when encountering random monsters on the main map. The turn-based combat consists of simply moving your character to the enemy position, or manually aiming at the enemy with melee or ranged weapons. Combat then is defined by text messages indicating attack and defense roles. Magic (or known as Spark in Aleshar) is an ability acquired later in the game, consists of single or combined use of the five available runes (fire, water, earth, air, and spirit). Each spell may be tweaked to a certain power level, the higher the power used, the greater the effect but the more straining it is to your character's fatigue. Spells directed to yourself or your allies are always beneficial while spells directed to your enemies are always damaging.",

Punctuating the landscape, however, are a series of shimmering, radiant pillars made of energy. Entering into them kicks the game into its Mr. Hyde mode, a workmanlike Breakout clone.

KING). At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace. However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger. Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves. Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies. If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled! Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death. All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.",

If the skittles are hit directly, the points go to the adversary; - Goriziana and its double variation are similar to 5 Pins, but have nine skittles and slightly different scoring rules; - Bowls is played without cues, where each player throws four balls from their sides of the table. A red ball is launched at the start of each match, and the main objective is to stop the other balls as close as possible to it. Extra points are received when knocking down skittles with the red ball or the opponent's ball; - In Carom, the goal is to hit both the red ball and the opponent's ball on each turn. In the Cushion variations, the player has to bounce the ball from one or more of the cushions before striking the second ball; - 3 Balls is similar to Carom, but the players share a single white ball to hit up to three other balls.",

The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.",

When you get to the top, the gorilla throws one barrel down the middle of the platforms. This creates extra gaps in the platforms you will have to jump across. Also, a house appears at the bottom of the screen. In the second part, you have to carry your girlfriend down to the house. This time, flaming barrels move up the ramps and the gorilla throws flaming barrels aimed directly at you, in a straight line. The player can move left and right or up and down ladders with the cursor keys and jump by pressing F1. But when holding down a cursor key the player character doesn't move smoothly, so in order to manoeuvre quickly enough to avoid the barrels, you have to keep tapping the cursor keys. Also, if you jump while standing on a ladder it's instant death. The game was programmed in GW-BASIC by an unknown author, and distributed as a compiled executable.",

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first. You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels. Gameplay in Dark Side has more action than its predecessor, Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.",

You are the stalwart adventurer bold enough to emerge from the ranks, accumulating through exploration the skills, experience, artifacts and followers necessary to undo his burger-hating rule and usher the realm of Braminar into a new golden age. The author has followed up the earlier Fantasia and concocted what he describes as \"boolean interactive fiction\" -- a game consisting of purely textual input and output occasionally prompting the player for confirmation of likely, valid actions in the style of many a BBS door game (\"you may (S)teal food, (T)ake from trunk, or (L)eave\"), mostly in answering Yes/No questions (\"You come up to a hollow tree with a door. Enter?\") or plugging in numbers for inventory management of a sort (\"2 male and 8 female slaves have come down with: Turkey Pox. How many males to cure?\") The game chugs along pretty much on its own -- combat, for instance, being a do-or-die affair of pressing any key to proceed to the next round, the computer taking care of both parties' tactics and strategies (or lack thereof: it will quite happily run you straight into the ground against a stronger opponent). It dishes up a varied but randomized assortment of standard adventure environments (sylvan glades, abandoned shacks, villages, inclement weather, Gypsy gambling dens, the Dark Castle of the Mad King) to be explored at your discretion, though it's up to the player and tough lessons learned in their past experience with the game to determine for themselves if they're tough enough to deal with (or desperate enough to risk dealing with) what they're likely to find in each area, which is sometimes beneficial (\"the gnome greets you and gives you 3 food\"), sometimes negative (\"You release a Rune Guardian which comes out and burns you\"), and sometimes neither (\"As you enter, a centurion says to you: 'Have you driven a Ford lately?'\"). As with Legend of the Red Dragon and Kingdom of Loathing, the stock fantasy tropes of fighting orcs and ogres with swords are mixed with jarring glimpses of surreal preoccupations -- here with giant hamburgers, Duncin' [sic] Doughnuts, and Hellen Reddy [sic]. Once the player has achieved the 20th level or beyond and accumulated both the Staff and the prime command, it is possible to enter the endgame, in which your total assets (largely, perhaps in a nod to Gor, consisting of male and female slaves) are converted into an army, one which automatically engages the Overlord's legions... their conflict depicted as two Progress Questian bars in a chart diminishing each other. Overwhelming forces will be needed to make even a dent in his waves of cannon fodder, but should you triumph over them, you then get to engage the Overlord in single combat.",

When encountering an enemy character you can shoot him or her with your mind beam and hopefully beat them. You will find clues and objects on your adventure which you can question Kayla with. You can use different psychic powers to fight, explore and defend yourself. Along the way you can also find allies that will want you join you on your quest and you will be able to use these characters as well in your battles.",

The player's character gives out bad vibes, which in any other game would be classed as bullets, along eight axes; up, down, left and right and at forty-five degrees in between. Potential gorilla partners appear randomly on the screen and track towards the player who must try to make contact with them while not 'shooting' them with bad vibes. The game could be described as the opposite of a shoot-'em up. Instead of aiming a gun and trying to hit opponents, the player is trying to get close to others without hurting them while, at the same time, spraying 'bullets' all over the screen. The player starts the game with 10,000 points and loses points steadily. Every time a potential gorilla ball partner is hit by bad vibes another hundred points are lost. At the end of the game the gorilla balls do a little dance. The game ends either when the player has been caught ten times, in which case there will be a positive score, or when all points have been lost, in which case the points score will be zero and the length of time played will determine whether the player has a high enough score to get onto the high score table.

A strategic map allows you to identify key islands for your cause and determine the mission objectives that will sway it's population to your cause. Then, it's up to you to head in and carry out the mission as you see fit (perhaps guns first, perhaps with a big bag of money, perhaps just relying on your charm).

A vast alien mothership hangs above it, mercilessly sucking out all of its natural resources. While you were away, the Eco Phantoms arrived, and did this! Now, you've managed to steal an Eco zeppelin craft and have gone down to Earth, to try to reverse the planet-draining process before it's too late. The Eco Phantoms have built several domes on the planet's surface, which house their buildings and equipment. You'll have to navigate through three of these domes, learning how to operate and maintain your alien craft, gathering resources, collecting data spheres, rescuing prisoners and engaging in confrontations with the Eco forces. Eventually, if you survive long enough, you'll be able to enter the alien mothership, where you will have to reprogram the main computer, to reverse the process and restore Earth to life.

The ultimate goal of the game is to locate the Grinch's stronghold and beat this powerful and psychotic enemy. To do so, you must first enter five other castles and beat the respective bosses there, each time gaining an indispensable item. The name of these bosses and castles shows a strong humorous element (Gilligan in the castaways' fortress; Buzz Aldrin, cult leader of These Who Came In Second).",

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups.",

This was 1991 in the news, and so in its games also. A topical spin made Missile Command suddenly relevant again, and so its shoot-the-missiles-before-they-deliver-their-payload gameplay was exhumed for another parade around the screen. In this case, your 24 Patriots are controlled by the mouse -- a first click will fire it to a portion of the screen, while a second will cause it to detonate. Firing from the right and left batteries is controlled by choosing to click with the right or left mouse buttons, respectively. The game is over when all the player's buildings have been destroyed... or they may survive long enough to participate in further waves of bombardment, missiles falling more and more quickly.",

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next. Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty. The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.",

                "plot": "In the year 2104, the Solar Union (the government of Earth and the solar system) faces trouble from three former colonies. Under the guise of negotiations, the colonies' forces attack and capture three mining worlds: Neptune's moon Triton, the Earth-like planet Romulous and the water world Pacifica. Earth's survival is at stake. It is the player's mission to strike back at the invaders and recapture the three worlds. Earth's full arsenal of ground, air and naval forces is standing by. This version of Nectaris is an updated and expanded version of the original game with a new background story, an entirely different graphical style and lots of new content. It includes all maps (the setting of which has been changed from the Earth's moon to Triton) and units from the original game. Two new sets of maps (the Romulous and Pacifica campaigns) have been added for a total of 96 levels. There are also many new units, more than doubling the number of the original. The non-lunar settings of the new campaigns allow for naval units for the first time (including submarines and ship-based aircraft), as well as such units as helicopters, jump-jet infantry and paratroopers. Gameplay is unchanged from the original. Units move and attack in turns on a tactical map. Each unit has different ratings for attack and defense as well as range. Combat is decided by various factors including the combatants' abilities, troop strength and experience, terrain, and the positioning of support units. Units cannot be created. The only way to gain new units is to capture depots containing neutral units. To win each map, either the enemy's headquarters must be captured or all his forces be destroyed. At any time between battles, the campaign can be switched among the three different worlds. The last mission beat on each world is automatically saved, and earlier maps can be accessed through passwords. It is also possible to save the game during a battle. In addition to the single player maps, there are also 8 special multiplayer maps, which can be played by up to four players (or AIs, if not enough people are available). In multi-player mode, various diplomatic relations can be set between the different parties, from alliances to all-out war.",

Accidentally, Colin has been digitized and curlified into his computer at the moment he completed the final level of the game. Colin has been trapped inside his own computer and an amazing array of challenges are standing between him and the escape from this electronic nightmare. You have to move Colin Curly from the ENTRY packet to the EXIT packet by jumping from one platform to the next. Colin can only escape from a level if ALL the platforms have shut before he reaches the exit. As Colin steps off a platform, it will slide shut behind him, never to open again unless it has special properties. So, it is important to work out the correct route to follow in order to close all the platforms before Colin reaches the EXIT while still being able to move around the level.",

This broke the balance, and monsters began to roam the land and attack townspeople. A brave hero is needed to defeat the fiends and restore peace! Fire King is a follow-up to Demon Stalkers.

The player explores the top-down world, descending into dungeons and fighting hordes of enemies in fast-paced, action-oriented combat. Compared to its spiritual predecessors, Fire King incorporates more RPG elements.The player can choose to control one of the six available characters, and specialize in one of the three disciplines: Magic, Armor, and Strength.

Regrettably, that is not the case. Fortunately for the player, a stopgap measure is available to instantaneously block a bridge gap, all at the press of a key, typing in the number of the gap to cover. Unfortunately, as the people cross one gap and approach the next, the makeshift walkway must be moved. If the shameless walkers would cooperate and move in groups, this would be a piece of cake, but instead the player needs to accommodate all of them at their own paces and schedules, regardless of which gap they're approaching. At least they're all traveling in the same direction, right? Well, except for every third level. Wouldn't things be easier if only they'd built the bridge correctly in the first place?",

The player uses the arrow keys to control a green snake that is constantly moving through a scrolling labyrinth. The snake has a certain amount of strength at its disposal that decreases by movement and will immediately kill the snake when run out. This strength can be refilled by eating apples (spawning one after another) and pears (spawning randomly) in the labyrinth, but the hook is that eating such fruits will grow the snake, thus making it harder to navigate through the sometimes narrow corridors, because hitting its own tail will also end the game as will hitting a wall. If the player manages to eat enough apples, the level exit will open and allow access to the next floor of the labyrinth. Eating pears will refill the strength meter to full power and yield 800 points. The goal of Snaker is to accumulate enough points to make it into the integrated high score list. Points can be earned by eating fruits and finishing a level with as much remaining strength as possible.",

Graphs are also available to show the history of a stock throughout the game in order to aid in making decisions. After each player has a turn buying and selling, the stock market closes for the night. When it opens again, you will see a news ticker summarizing the changes to stock prices and the players will again have an opportunity to buy or sell (this process repeats until the end of the game when the winner is determined). Although the price changes to stocks are random, you can attempt to influence the price somewhat by buying or selling large quantities of a stock. If a stock is doing very well, you may earn dividends or the stock may split. If you get into trouble, you can also visit the bank and take out a loan.",

Finally realising that no-one was going to win the war a truce was declared. However during the war the rival factions have disrupted the space lanes with mines, robot attack ships and general junk that they are unusable and someone has to take on the job of blasting everything into dust. The player takes on the role of Sed Fransord a kind of interstellar junk man who just happens to have a ship fitted with big guns and other cool weapons. The Earth Alliance has contacted Sed and offered him the clean up job and Sed needs the money. This is a fast paced 3D shoot 'em up game with twelve levels, three of which were made available in the shareware release. There are three levels of difficulty entitled 'I'm a puppy', 'Let's Rock', and 'Bring 'em on Big Daddy!' Each level has a mission - clear up the mines on one level, toxic waste on another - set against a different stellar backdrop and always with hordes of attacking drones, space ships and of course asteroids and the debris caused by all Sed's blasting.",

You will need to choose the right balance of these for your mission, which involves tracking down Malifon and gain revenge on the damage he has done to Ymros. Combat takes place via close-quarters combat and spell-casting, depending on the character's abilities. Towns can be visited to buy weapons, and you can return to your camp to worship one of the various Gods and receive their gifts such as resurrection and protection. It has also a 'skill/item' menu in which items can be used on other items to solve problems.",

Control a team of 8 characters in a quest to find and destroy the demons of Omalin. The game manual boasts over 200 hours solving time, 100 spells, 300 different monsters, and a system for generating potentially millions of items by combining them with various enchantments and materials. In the author's own words: \"It's like a war game with a plot and  character development. There are no \"experience points\" in  Nahlakh... skills are learned by doing, not mystically improving  out of thin air.\"  The game begins with a fairly involved process of setting up your party of 8 characters. For each character 50 points are given to distribute among the main attributes of strength, intelligence, dexterity, and health. Additionally, picking an icon that represents the character, this selection will affect the skills chosen; essentially the icons are character classes. Next a number of skills are randomly selected with varying levels of accomplishment described humorously with adjectives such as \"lousy\", \"feeble\", \"wretched\". With your party created the game begins, and the party is transported to the world map where a group of enemies waits close by; to the north lies a town called Nedly. The world map will remind one of the early Ultima series with the player character represented by an non-animated icon. The battle system is similar to that found within Pool of Radiance (1989); it is turn-based, each character has a limited number of steps that it takes, and then an adjacent enemy icon is targeted for attack. The game is well documented, and pressing F1 at anytime will bring up context-sensitive help. Since the game is heavily driven by keyboard commands this is an important feature.",

There are 5 armies (3 Allied & 2 Axis) and 5 scenarios, including the battles of Kasserine and Mareth. Each scenario has several pre-conditions to start from, which include Axis control Malta, Axis capture Bone, DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps) destroyed, Desert armies late, and French neutrality. The gameplay is flown on scrolling map by turns. Player selects the units and gives them orders. Units move on the grid of rectangular cells. Landscape objects influence on the movement. For example, mountainous terrain allows hidden movement, or river blocks the way. Air attack phase is possible between turns. The game comes with detailed instruction booklet and includes historical notes on the campaign, maps and photographs. Two players representing Allied and Axis may be computer or human.",

When mayan idols disappear in the South American rain forest, the Team Quest sets out to comb through the jungle and a couple of temples. Gameplay is divided into two parts: On the top-down map of the forest and the temples, Jonny and his friend Hadji search for useful items and solve puzzles. If they encounter an adversary, the game switches to a side-view. Jonny's then got to defeat his opponent in classical beat-em-up-style with a variety of punches and kicks. After a short time, Hadji and the dog Bandit appear on the scene and help Jonny by casting spells (Hadji) and dragging the enemy around (Bandit). If you lose, you'll get two additional chances; after that, the game is over. All main actions (talk, look around, access inventory) are performed via the F-keys; more sophisticated possibilities like using items involve strings of F-key/direction key usage. The puzzles in the game are inventory-based.",

The object of the game is to build up your business empire and become the richest player while other players are forced to either declare bankruptcy or resign. The game world consists of 52 different countries, each of which contains one company. You begin the game with 100 million dollars, and need to travel around the world to buy companies. Each turn begins in the board room, and then you will be randomly sent to one of the countries. If the company there hasn't been bought yet, you have the option to purchase it, but if another player already owns it you will have pay them a profit for landing there. In addition to landing on a property, you also have other options on each turn: you can invest in companies you own (this increases their profits), borrow money, pay back money, sell companies, make deals with other players, or even resign if there is no hope of winning. Each turn is equivalent to roughly a months time. Each of the companies available is part of a different industry (chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, and textiles). In addition to building plants, you may also increase your companies profits by building vertical monopolies. To obtain a vertical monopoly, you must own three companies, one in each area of a particular industry (for example, a vertical monopoly in the electronics industry requires that you own companies in copper mining, semiconductors, and computers). Their is also a fifth industry which is owned by the computer and cannot be bought by players: shipping. Since the companies owned are located in different countries, each player will need to pay shipping costs every quarter (every three turns). A players shipping costs are determined by the number of companies owned, their locations, and what industries they are a part of. From time to time, a random event may occur on a players turn which can help or hinder progress. Natural disasters can destroy factories, workers may strike, you may have a chance to gamble at a casino, you may take a vacation (and lose a turn!), you may receive a grant from Washington D.C., or you may become ill are some of the events that can occur.",

The game is divided into 7 sets of 18 levels, and lets the player go through the levels in a set in any order. To beat a level the player usually has to make a given number of rows disappear, much like in any other Tetris clone. The difference is in the levels themselves. Some levels might have invisible blocks, others an indestructable snake that the player have to trap before theres a chance of making a row disappear. For beating a level, the player receives money, the amount depending on how well they did during gameplay and the difficulty of the level. The money can be used to buy powerups, of which there is a great variety. Some powerups are permanent, such as the monitors previewing the next block. Other powerups are bound to the Function Keys on the keyboard, and can be activated at any time during gameplay. These range from level type specific powerups like the Fork which traps a snake, to general powerups like the Bomb, which destroys the top row of squares. To save the game the player need to buy a powerup as well.",

Crystal Pixels does not directly fit into any genres. Rooms and platforms sit in a void of space, encircling a lone star. These small rooms, called \"pixels\", can either have objects in them, or be entirely empty. When an explorer lands on one, they can move objects around, and can add and remove objects as well. This program does not have a preformed plot or goal to it, but instead allows the user to do with it what they like.",

The player's gorilla ball is entirely controlled by the keyboard and once they start to move in a given direction they will continue to move in that direction until steered else where. The points total builds the longer the player survives. The object is to survive until the chasing gorilla ball has caught all the other gorilla balls and thus build a high score.

While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.",

Successfully \"painting\" an entire section will automatically paint the entire square and thus adding points. Successfully painting all the squares will advance you to the next level. While painting these sections, you have to avoid the Brush Brothers. Physical contact with them will automatically kill one of your lives. Another entity in the game is the \"eraser brush\" which will erase any painted lines you've previously painted. This however, does not apply to squares you've successfully painted. Your paint supply however, does not last forever. Pick up cans of paint when you've run out of paint to continue your painting. Another \"power-up\" enables you to \"kill\" the Brush Brothers, allowing you to paint in peace until they regenerate again (indicated when the \"power-up\" song ends). Higher levels introduces more difficult challenges, among others but not limited to: Faster movement of the Brush Brothers, requiring more than 1 lap to successfully paint a square, limited paint cans, etc.",

Drake explores the 13 levels of underground caverns and tries to find the exit while avoiding or killing the enemies within. Enemy creatures involve man-eating plants, spiders, birds and scorpions. Some enemies kill Drake instantly, while others just drain his health (not to mention that Drake's health is constantly falling slowly). Drake's main assets include: his jetpack which allows him to fly (but has limited fuel), a gun (with limited ammo) and bombs which can be set on the ground. Some walls can be blown up with bombs.",

In pursuit of the items on this bizarre shopping list (the Cauldron has been fractured into numerous pieces, by the way -- the game's not as short as it might initially seem) you will travel high and low through varied environments -- dodging falling rocks on a cliffside, investigating a cave hidden behind a waterfall; you'll gaze upon a mountaintop rainbow and keep careful note of passages in a subterranean labyrinth (\"The Incredibly Twisty Maze-Like Cave\"). You'll even win a dance contest! Through it all you'll encounter characters straight out of Vodoun folklore, from peaceful Rada loa to angry Petro loa and the notorious Baron Samedi, all along the way to a final showdown with the Dream King himself! All this subversive occultism in a game with little violence and no obscene language (so the author's little brother could play 8)",

White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.

This fully functional game was the author's contribution to Allegro Speedhack 2001. At first glance the game appears to be an Othello clone, two players take turns placing colored tiles on an 8x8 board. Beyond that the rules and objectives differ. The objective is to end the game with the highest score once either opponent has cleared all their tiles. Each turn a player may either place one of their colored tiles or slide any row/column by one unit. The row/column may not be moved again for one turn. When a group of four tiles forming a square is made, they are cleared from the board. If a player manages to remove 6 tiles in a rectangle they are awarded a special yellow tile which acts as a wild card allowing a square to be completed for any color. To make things even more interesting gray tiles will periodically appear on the board at random unfilled spots; a gray tile can only be removed with 3 yellow tiles although it's unlikely a player will use them in this way. What makes this game interesting is that you can score points by completing squares of either color; for example, if your opponent slides a row and completes a square with your colored tiles he gets the points instead of you. The game also has two levels of challenge for the human vs computer mode, a high score table, sounds, and music. Not bad for 72 hours!",

The artwork is in the style of a child's stick-figure drawings in a notebook, down to the notebook-paper style background. The story, art-style, and underlying 2D geometry engine allow all the objects to be animated, rotated, and scaled. For example, in one level you ride a hot-air balloon to the moon and are able to walk all the way around the moon, ending up upside-down at the bottom, where a sign says \"Earth\" with an arrow pointing down -- you jump and rotate while falling until you land back on the Earth. In another level you jump from car to car along a train, trying to get to the engine, and you see mountains in the distance. Once you reach the engine you find that you can jump from the smoke clouds to the tops of the mountains, and the world scales as you jump -- it was just a small toy train after all.",

There is no two-player option. There are ten difficulty levels. Each player's fleet consists of eight ships, compared to the five featured in the board game version. These include an aircraft carrier, battleship, destroyer, cruiser, mine sweeper, submarine, spy ship and patrol boat. Because of the larger number of ships, the game also features a larger playing grid which measures 15 x 19 squares compared to the standard 10 x 10. Grid squares are selected by moving a cursor over the grid, either with the cursor (arrow) keys or using a joystick. There is no mouse support. When placing ships on the player's grid, they can be pivoted so that they are oriented either vertically or horizontally using the space bar. The computer A.I. elicits a personality of sorts, gloating every time it sinks a ship, and protesting when one of its ships is sunk. This can be turned off by those who find it annoying.",

The game features 9 levels. In the first 5 you have to avoid only one enemy. The last 4 are harder, as there are two enemy characters moving around trying to get you. Besides simply running away from them, there are two other ways to escape, but you'll lose points if you use them. First, you can jump to another place in the board. Second, you can cut temporarily the line behind you, making it impossible for your enemies to catch you from that direction. Each box has a number inside. Those are the points you win when that box is \"captured\". You also gain points by completing levels depending on the time you took. The faster you are, the more you win.

It utilizes a first-person view for exploration, similarly to Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder. One of the more remarkable features is in the first-person mode: rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them, there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel. The action elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks. Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.",

The Giraffe is child's play; the Lion and Zebra are only average players--the Elephant will consistently beat them by 15 more stones. To get the Elephant you'll have to register Wari.\" Wari is an African Strategy Game for 2 players. Also known as MANCALA and OURRI, Wari is over 4,000 years old and was used to train African tribal chiefs.

The game contains several scenarios (although you can design your own with a text editor) that present the general background of the game (number of players, number of turns and difficulty). Each map is randomly generated, and wins the player with the highest score when reaching the turn maximum. Colonies cannot be created. Instead, there are independent planets that must be conquered in order to adding them to your empire. Colony management is almost automatic, as there are no facilities (apart of certain orbital platforms) to build and resources are used and divided by the computer. The different types of ships and troops, also, are automatically built in planets equipped with the necessary tech. Tech is discovered linearly as you progress, but each planet has a tech level (that also advances automatically when in an empire) that determines what can be constructed there. You can, however, establish the general purpose of a colony (agricultural, military outpost, raw material mine...) and transport freely resources and troops between colonies, and you must pay attention to several statistics (efficiency, warehouses, type of planet...). As there is no diplomacy (except a message system for multiplayer), Anacreon plays mainly as a game about war and conquest.",

In the game you have to travel to various European countries and their famous locations to search for clues. You may travel only between adjacent countries on the map. Clues will be left behind by friendly agents and indicate where jewels are located. When you will come across an informant, he should be bribed with money or jewels to receive a clue, where Dr. X is.

If you are successful in your mission, you are given an efficiency rating; the fewer turns you can locate Dr. X in and the more jewels recovered, the better your score will be. The game is available for one player, as well as two game modes for multiple players - cooperative \"spy network\" or \"spy against spy\". The progress may be saved and restored later.

Each team has a number of cows that will fight for the cause. The teams have no advantages or disadvantages and only differ in color, like in chess. The battleground map, other than the two herds, also consist of scattered weapons: a katana sword or a shotgun and various terrain. However, the battleground map also introduced fog of war, where both team players must search the grey areas in order to achieve line of sight. Once they grey area's are explored, it stays that way. The game play is divided into two major modes, movement and combat. Movement consists of moving the cow in accordance with the Movement Points (MUs). While moving, the cow can usually search and explore the battleground to find enemies and weapons, as well as pick up weapons, which is done automatically by moving to the square where the weapon is allocated. A cow picking up a katana (melee) automatically becomes a Ninja Cow in a ninja outfit. A cow picking up a shotgun because a Mean Cow Punk with black shades (ranged). Cows can also move into strategic squares for defence or offence. Combat depends on what weapon the cow wields. If the cow is a ninja, eventually it has to come within range of the enemy cow, i.e. an adjacent square. Shotgun cows can attack enemy cows at range within line of sight.",

The events are varied and range from running the 100 meter dash to the javelin throw. And the selection of athletes is generous with a good selection of both male and female stars.

Aside from the scenarios there are the game modes \"Attack\", \"Defend\" or \"Encounter\" where the attacker has to move to the opposite end of the map and the defender has to prevent this. In the encounter mode both opponents are gaining ground. Most of the game is played on the hex field map where movement and attacking orders are filed. Other windows include statistics and detailed settings. There are two phases: In the first one the player give his orders and in the second one the orders are carried out. The execution phase also is divided in several phases: Airstrike, arty, surprise fire, defensive fire, and movement. For the results of the orders the game uses several complex calculations, e.g. every shot from a machine gun salvo is calculated separately. The sighting also uses this calculations and take the vegetation, lighting or smoke into account. It is even possible to see some units in a hex field but not all. Another important feature are order delays. Orders travel from TF headquarters to the battalion HQ and then to the individual unit. Other things the player has to consider are tactical possibilities like carpet bombing or amphibious assaults and the morale which affect every other action. If the morale of a unit is too low they surrender or go berserk. There are absolutely no animations in the game, all fighting results are shown in text messages",

Its training, and transition to Thurleigh, England, and twenty five missions that a pilot might have flown at that time. You'll start of as a second lieutenant with only a few hours of flight experience. You must choose your crew, and then learn to fly in a series of training flying missions. You'll then also learn how to take off with your plane and then form in a formation group. After learning the basics, you'll go out on practice bombing runs. Earning the highest efficient ratings will get you the best scores during the game. The first missions will start in the USA. When your are finished with the training missions, you'll fly to England to take part in the war effort. Now your 25 mission tour of duty will begin, where you take part in bombing raids over Germany. Make sure you make a copy of you game disk before beginning to play. You'll have to drop bombs and then make your way back home. Sometimes damage will occur during these missions. Aptitude, Stamina, Copilot, Bombardier, Navigator, Engineer, Radio Operator and Gunner Positions all have an effect how your missions succeed. Each mission that you undertake will have a briefing screen describing the mission and objectives, similar to the screens in the training session. During you missions, there are thirteen possible types of damage that your aircraft can sustain. After each mission is completed, you will earn efficiency points. You will gain points for amount of enemy craft shot down, completing the mission and successful formations during the mission. You will also loose efficiency points for crashing, using a secondary airfield, ditching, bailing out and if you fall out of formation.",

Points will be awarded for your evasive skills as your enemies are very well armed and for your hunting skills. Luckily your weapons are far stronger but there's strength in numbers. At your disposal are the following tools; radar, sonar, anti-missile weapons, radio jammers, and of course your ordnance. Your view screen shows two main windows with one devoted to our ship's status and one command menu where you give orders and receive notes about what is happening around you. Information is constantly being updated as to your ships defenses and weapons as well as the position of enemies and their missiles. The game-play is turn based and you can try and enter as many commands as you like in the given time period. As with many simulation games there are repercussions to damages you will receive from malfunctioning radars to weapon arrays.

Lythare blames the kingdom's Champion Knight-Paladin, as well as several members of the court for failing to protect the child, and imprisons them in the dungeon. The Champion's son, knowing that his father must not have deserved imprisonment sets out on a quest to find the baby with his two companions. However not much is known of the fate of the child, so perhaps other quests and objectives will need to be accomplished first. The Aethra Chronicles: Volume One: Celystra's Bane is a shareware medieval role-playing game in the tradition of SSI's Dungeons & Dragons licensed Gold Box RPGs. Taking it's inspiration from that, the game uses a similar system based on die rolls against stats/skill combinations. Players begin by creating three characters, choosing their class and stats in various stats such as Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Presence, Memory, and Reason. The player then assigns skill proficiencies in a variety of abilities dependent on those stats (such as Spell Lists, Pick Lock, Woods Lore, etc.). Combat between characters and monsters is turn-based and the player can recruit an additional three characters for a total of six. As with most shareware games, the first episode (The Book of Prophecy) can be freely distributed, while the other two (Gems of Power and Demon's Might) available only to registered users.",

                "plot": "Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than on character stats. The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos' minions, and leaves his home village. After \"character creation\" (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way. The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of the game is played in towns or travelling between them. When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are \"magic mushrooms\" and some other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this game. While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos' minions, which results in some pseudo-real time combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course. The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and you have to prepare the spell first. The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, like \"G\" for getting things or \"C\" for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and loaded at the main menu.",

In the balloon mission, you try to shoot down or defend a large floating Zeppelin.Hornet's Nest is likely to be very challenging for a beginner, although ace pilots may quickly take advantage of the game's nonexistent WW1 fighter flight dynamics to dispose of enemy planes.",

The ball is controlled with two knobs on the side of the maze. One of the knobs leans the maze horizontally and the other vertically. The route through the maze is drawn on it, but there are holes along the route that easily swallow the ball. While the children's version used knobs, this computer version uses arrow keys. Also different mazes, scoring, and time limits for the mazes were added to take advantage of computer technology. So in this game player tries to guide the ball through the maze to the goal before the time runs out. If the 'koolah' falls into a hole, player gets one point for each hole successfully left behind. If the time runs out before player reaches the goal, player gets as many points as there are holes in that maze. But if player manages to clear the maze in the given time, s(he) gets 150 points plus the remaining time is turned into points. The more time player has left, the more points s(he) gains. Top ten high score list shows the best players.",

After an animal appears, the crosshair needs to be quickly moved over them and a click triggers the photograph. The interface is basically a set of buttons which need to be clicked on to change the active crosshair: hand (needed to pick up additional equipment or medi packs for healing), 50 mm lens, telephoto lens (for small and far off animals) and a rifle (shooting hunters which try to hurt the player). The number of photographs the player can take is limited and needs to be refilled by picking up frequently appearing new rolls.",

Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over. In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.",

Balloons fall from the top of the screen and  the objective is to blow the balloons over to the opposing players  side where they will burst on contact and score points.

Releasing passes involves rotating the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of the screen. There are 28 teams split into four divisions; their names are fictional (including the Seagulls, Mustangs and Geronimos), and each is rated out of 3 on 8 areas of skill. Matches last for 4 quarters of either 4 or 7 minutes' in-play time. Menus to select plays or teams involve using diagonal movements for selection. Standard Gridiron rules apply - gain 10 yards in 4 attempts (downs) without fumbling or having a pass intercepted; kick a punt or field goal if you are about to fail at this.",

In order to stop their plan you read a lot of info found in Top Secret folders, set wiretaps, monitor and interrogate suspects and informants, and gather facts and clues. The game has three main sections - The NATO Documents, The Bomb and The SAS Assault. A secret code must be gained in order to proceed from one to the next. Unique icon-based graphics provide the means to conduct your investigation though they're not mouse-clickable (you have to browse the icons using the space bar).

While you can adjust the difficulty of the task, the object in all cases is the same: to search the complex, find and release as many of the prisoners as possible (by activating the transporter beam, which will teleport them back up to the ship), and get out alive-in an hour or less. If the Tollah base can be likened to an iceberg, you begin the game at the tip: inside the top room, the only one that connects the complex with the surface of the asteroid. (Since there is no air and no escape on the asteroid itself, the door to the outside, being \"off limits,\" is not shown on the display). From this vestibule there are only two usable exits. The larger obviously leads to a gravshaft; the smaller looks like an ordinary doorway-but there are no other rooms on the floor. Whichever way you choose to begin your quest, there will be no turning back once you walk through the door.",

Nobody believes in you and now it's up to you to accomplish this suicidal mission. Earth Invasion is a shareware space arcade shooter with 10 missions. In each of the 10 missions you have to defeat five waves of human ships that differ from each other in their type and their amount. To clean each system a capital ship needs to be destroyed. After that you return to your home destroyer but your ship won't be repaired (remember, they want you dead) and you carry your defects into the next system. But your space fighter is equipped with HIJKE shield converters. From time to time a HIJKE capsule prowls through the system and when you catch it your shield regenerates. Unfortunately you only have 30 shield converters i.e. you should ration these capsules. Shareware version is limited to the first five missions and you can't save your game.",

You do this in a turn-based manner by entering short text commands. Each room of the castle may contain a monster (which will probably result in a simple turn-based combat), a vendor where you can buy and sell things, or special items with random effects (books, magic pools and chests). If you're intelligent enough, you can also cast spells. Small extensions have been made, for example, there are two additional classes at character generation and more monsters. The game also has enhanced text graphics and a more intuitive interface -- for example, the room contents are not indicated by just one letter like \"D\", but by short words. The gameplay may seem simplistic at the beginning, but winning the game involves using right strategies which monsters to attack, when to cast spells and the right use of the items and special places.",

The player controls a party of four characters, each with some standard-issue attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Piety, Body Points and Magic Points. The game also features three of the usual character classes (fighters, mages and priests), and there are different spell lists for each of the spell-casting classes. Players can create their own characters or use the ones provided by the game; either way, progress is automatically saved from time to time (though there is a reset button which allows the player to start over from the beginning). The game starts out in a town (which is portrayed simply by a text-based menu system) and then proceeds into a multi-level dungeon. While exploring the dungeon, different areas of the screen display different information. There is a first-person, ninety-degree-turning view, an automap and, in some areas, a textual description. These are supplemented by random third-person, turn-based combat encounters which take place in the window that normally shows the 3-D dungeon view. In typical role-playing style, combat yields rewards of gold and experience (and sometimes equipment), and characters gain in abilities as they increase in experience.",

Now it is the year 2060 AD. You are an HX-909 soldier in the HeXonium Force, the only known remaining human resistance group. From Zzexon's compound Zzexlia, perhaps the safest spot in a world where walking down the buckled asphalt remnants irradiates you, you mount exploratory expeditions into the great unknown in order to recover essential water crystals, harden yourself for combat, and arrive at a better understanding of what your planet has become. When the time is right, you will descend deep into the corrupted earth, past defunct air bases and toxic landfills, to take back the water and land that is your birthright and lay to rest the rumour that the notorious general Overkill still befouls Terran soil with his footprint. The game output is restricted to text descriptions and coloured ASCII symbols on a map. The grim atmospheric tone of the writing is compounded with the irrevocable strangeness of the setting. Sense of urgency is compounded by a reflex-based combat system, both long-range and melee targets lined up by successfully hitting the space bar at the correct moment of a count-down, the harder the target the faster the countdown -- a real problem with slow modem latency of the era, prompting the release of an ANSI terminal for the game, keeping the bulk of the data (and digitised sound) on the client's end rather than the server's.",

Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks.

The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them.

The objective of the game is to place the tiles on the board in such a way to create the longest connected path possible. This is done by placing any given tile next to a tile with a connecting path. Each connecting path is awarded with points, regardless if the tile is different from the prior. However, if the tile place next to the prior tile is of the same color, you of course get higher points. If you don't get that description, it's basically similiar to games like Pipe Dream.",

The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core. You're controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You've got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You've got to consider chain reactions. Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own. You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there's a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!",

Naturally a fighter like this will give you a great advantage. Unfortunately your opponent is flying the exact same thing. Quick reactions will determine the outcome of this duel in outer-space involving up to four opponents. Be careful of other ships flying about and mind those asteroids. LineWars is an space-fighter sim that takes place in the far reaches of another galaxy. You control your ship via mouse or keyboard from a first person perspective. By using the number keys you can look around the different viewpoints of your ship and of course will have to do so to mount those rear beams. Your weapons are the aforementioned laser beams and missiles. The missiles only fire when locked on a target but the lasers can be used to blast meteors, passing law-abiding space ships and just to waste your energy. Your energy (shields) and lasers have a limited gauge. Once the gauge lowers to zero for your lasers you will have to wait a few seconds for them to refill. This naturally doesn't apply to your energy. Once those babies come down it's just a few inches of hull between you and oblivion. Missiles are limited to four shots but there is the off chance that your missile launcher will jam at which point you must engage in battle without them. The game receives it's name not from the linear polygonal graphics but from fighting \"on-line\". That is, phone line. Multi-player battles can be fought via modem between four players but there's always the computer if friends are lacking. Settings of the game are adjustable in that you can select friction and speed at which you react and the number of opponents fighting.",

Matches with over three tiles get you more points. A screen with high scores and a boss key function have been included. This game was developed by Brad P.

The truck with toxic ingredients crashed on one of the crossroads with Rodeo Dr., and all citizens were evacuated to the Hotel until the National Guard arrives. All except two - football player Boomer Hayes and his girlfriend Laura Sage. Robbers led by the head of L.A. football team, Robert Masterson, want to steal the priceless Botticelli Fresco and kill Boomer, but Boomer wants to stop the robbery and bring Masterson to justice, while evading ex-cops and the hired thug Benitez, who has commandeered a SWAT tank and is gunning for him. Switching between Laura and Boomer, the player has to re-create the main events of the movie, carefully walking through Beverly Hills, collecting inventory items, and using them with 'USE' and 'HIDE' commands. Point of view changes between top-down to side-scrolling or first-person when the player enters important places. Boomer's inventory includes a diskette, which allows to save or load the game. Every death of any character means the end of the game and exit to the operating system. In the beginning, Boomer has to visit the police station to acquire the empty gun, the vest protecting him from bullets of ex-cops and the radio transmitter to have a window to outer world. As Laura, the player explores a hotel to take a useful key. The next actions of the main characters include three main goals of the game:  1. Free the real cops from the fire station.  2. Rescue the Botticelli fresco.  3. Save Laura from Masterson after she is captured.  Action elements of the game include evading enemies with machine-guns, and moving fast on the streets to avoid getting killed.",

Professor Hybrys' variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice. The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key - a very useful option in tricky situations. Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.",

T'ufo - a planet notorious for its dirtiness - has sent a rat-shaped ship called Rath-Tha to destroy the tube. The game commands a ship to destroy Rath-Tha. The game consists of four phases. Starting off inside the tube, the player fights off swarms of enemies. The ship can be moved to any part of the screen while shooting. Next, there is an area with megatronic generators. In the third phase the ship leaves the tube and reaches outer space. It needs to avoid torrents of waste that are immune to shots. The chemical substance alters the ship's controls. Finally, the ship reaches Rath-Tha and needs to fight inside to destroy the core. There are bonuses such as metal waste that restores shield, trash bags to regain energy, and radioactive canisters for temporary immunity. The player also carries three CODA codes to destroy barriers inside Rath-Tha.",

One magical Christmas you visit your grandfather's estate at Attervist Manor, only to discover him mysteriously caught in an unwakeable slumber, suspiciously bearing a letter from the solicitors of the sinister dentist who lives next door regarding his purchase of Grandad's estate. You will travel the length and breadth of this estate in search of a cure to your grandfather's condition and buried treasure to ensure the estate's financial independence. But that's not what this game is about: it's about the particle accelerator in the bedroom and the Viking longboat stuck in the pond ice; it's about the clockwork shark (Grandad's contribution to the war effort) baking goodies in the kitchen; it's about needing the gloves so you can pick up the hedgehog. No, these don't make sense -- but as games are about fun we can overlook that and hide it beneath the Groucho Marx-glasses of \"whimsy.\"",

The player navigates the hero through top-down environments heavily populated by hostile creatures. Standing near the enemy and pressing the attack button will make the protagonist swing the equipped melee weapon; ranged attacks require an additional directional key to execute. As the player progresses, defeating enemies on the way, the protagonist gains levels and becomes stronger. Various weapons and other items are scattered around the dungeons; the hero equips a weapon automatically when he finds it.",

The introduction claims: \"With the   exception of this introduction, the writing in this book was all   done by computer.\"   The authorship is attributed to RACTER, originally \"written in   compiled BASIC on a Z80 with 64k of RAM.\"  Racter strings together words according to \"syntax directives\", and the illusion of coherence is increased by repeated re-use of text variables. This gives the appearance that Racter can actually have a conversation with the user that makes some sense, unlike Eliza, which just spits back what you type at it. Of course, such a program has not been written to perfection yet, but Racter comes somewhat close. Since some of the syntactical mistakes that Racter tends to make cannot be avoided, the decision was made to market the game in a humorous vein, which the marketing department at Mindscape dubbed \"tongue-in-chip software\" and \"artificial insanity\".",

After a long and intensive interrogation the Markana leave you alone in their maze. They are so certain that their obstacle, trap and puzzle laden maze is impenetrable that they leave no guards around so all the player has to do is escape. Further evidence of their pride in the security of their maze is the fact that they also use it to store treasure and the odd gun. Points are scored for each object collected. The game is divided into sections. Program Markana1 includes levels 1, 2, and 3 while program Markana2 includes levels 4, 5, and 6 and so on. On loading the game it attempts to adjust to the speed of the host computer. This test takes between one and ten minutes but, according to the game's documentation, can take up to twenty minutes. There is an on-screen manual which describes the game in detail, this accessed by a separate program. The game has one save slot. The shareware version has six levels. The full registered version has 12 levels and over 1000 screens.",

Being the spryest land lobster in all of Norumbega, Peach, has been chosen by the leaders of the coastal town to take out Fang Duck and restore peace to the lands.

Peach the Lobster can jump around, and use his claw gun to hit enemies or monitors to release items like 1-up Lobsters, health-up shells and bonus points. Peach can also slide, run and duck under platforms and crevices. If your goal is a little higher than that well Peach can also double jump up there. There are four regions that Peach will have to traverse. Grasslands is where the adventure begins. Filled with lush foliage, waterfalls and hills, Grasslands is the main territory in Norumbega. When you arrive in the region of Atland be wary of currents and underwater hazards as this region mysteriously sank under water a thousand years ago. The Norumbegan Caves is where you will find yourself after that. These torch-lit caverns lead up to windswept mountaintops and are the last stop before The Techno-Castle. This wannabe-technologic wonder fort is the Fang Duck's lair and home to his bevy of futuristic minions including laser turrets, and robotic duck henchmen.

The game starts with a prologue to the rest of the game, where the player controls the main character's father while he is fighting for his life. After this brief prelude, the story jumps to 16 years-old Richard and his search for his father in Britain's moors. The parser is on par with the one developed by Infocom. It supports chain commands and adverb recognition, and goes beyond by adding support of mouse input and interface customization. These features are enabled on a menu that pops up when right-clicking on the screen. The optional verb menu allows complete sentence construction with the mouse. The interface can be changed to several different ways of displaying text, from a Zorkish traditional full screen output to a scrolling window. Some locations have a picture associated with them that can be displayed by pressing a key. There is support for setting up macros within the game (for example, a \"IN\" abbreviation for \"Inventory\" can be set by entering DEFINE IN=INVENTORY). The game has an online hint-system. The player gets clues by using the THINK ABOUT command with something in the game.

The tropes are familiar: royalty have lost valuable items and require their return, while exploration is thwarted with colour-coded locks -- can the player find or trade items for the quest objects and progress through the disjointed story via accessing more remote map areas? Instead of playing it straight with a poker face while mangling \"thee\"s and \"thou\"s, however, the author has strewn the game landscape with his high-school friends and titans of '90s industrial music. Gameplay consists of navigating a roguelike-ish top-down text-symbol map, seemingly a reel cut from LORD 2, using the keyboard arrows and a handful of verbs (at least, the first letters of the verbs) to interact with the world.

Historically, Harold the Second, last Anglo-Saxon king of England, lost the Battle of Hastings to William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, who became the next king. The game is flown on schematic map of England. Players take the roles of William and Harold. In turns they give orders, move units and conquer areas. To win the game, player must gain 60 points. Points are gained by controlling land and taxing peasants. Potency is important in taxing peasants and fighting: it is increased on \"low\" tax rates and decreased on \"medium\"/\"hard\" tax rates. Player will gain 1 point per 1 peasant at \"medium\" tax rate and 2 points at \"hard\" tax rate. To set the tax rate player should have tax collectors. If one of player's units enters an area occupied by enemy, the fight will be proposed. Area becomes controlled by player if it was not occupied by anyone, or fight was won. Spies may be used. They hide from the enemies and are not seen around 80% of the time no matter who occupies the land. Killing the opposing monarch will not necessarily win the game. Harold is already the king, so William can crown himself as soon as he gains 30 points or kills Harold. He must go to London to accept the crown. The educational twist of the game is in-game encyclopedia and a question before player's turn. Incorrect answer will result in a loss of player's movement ability. The Quiz full of questions on these historical events may be played instead of strategy simulation, where multiple options may be turned on/off as well.",

Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the \"A to B\" routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate. Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.",

The location of this life is just as surprising as its existence; There is a whole ecosystem living within the incredibly hostile atmosphere of the gas giant, Jupiter. When these findings became public, and the hostile nature of some of the creatures became known, the 'eye' of Jupiter was declared a frontier zone. Of course, it wasn't long before someone thought of a great way to make money out of our new neighbours and the first Hunters were dispatched from earth. Now TVs across the globe display nightly broadcasts of Hunters engaged in blood-thirsty combat with the inhabitants of Jupiter. Does no-one care that these new life-forms are being wiped out in the name of mass entertainment? Well, I.C.E. care. The Interstellar Conservation Executive has sent you, its newest recruit, off to Jupiter to study and document all the lifeforms you can find. You make money not by killing them, but by filming their actions. You can then use this money to upgrade your ship's engines and descend lower into Jupiter's atmosphere, to discover even weirder creatures. You'll also find people who want you to collect rare objects for them (also in exchange for cash), you'll find strange alien artefacts that may or may not help you in your quest and you'll probably have to engage in a few fights with the Hunters. It's a little sick, but these images will be broadcast to the audiences back home, too, so you'll make more money from that. Still, better to kill an evil Hunter from earth than a peaceful space whale from Jupiter, right?",

Each stage pits you against a contingent of alien ships hovering menacingly above you. Occasionally, an enemy will break formation and go out on a sortie, diving towards you while shooting - only to re-emerge at the top of the screen. The different ship types have different offensive maneuvers. Shooting them in the midst of a dive scores more points than picking them off in formation; some will bring their buddies along and go out in triads, which net you a special bonus if destroyed in the right order. Another bonus is awarded for eliminating the command ship that comes along once per level, shoots at you and runs off. You can temporarily protect yourself by activating your shields (at the cost of your ability to fire) - knock down the occasional floating disc to get an extra one. You start with three ships, and gain a new one for every 2000 points scored. 9 difficulty levels are available.",

You can make offerings to various Egyptian gods in hopes of divine aid, marry a bride to ensure that your line will continue if you fall in battle, wage wars with neighboring countries, and so on. To construct the various buildings, you will need to find different types. Your starting city will not have all the raw materials available, so you will be forced to conquer your neighbors early on. Combat takes place action-style. You will ride in a royal chariot, shooting arrows at the invaders who will throw lances at you. Divine favors, when they are granted, can result in complete annihilation of your enemies, but those are very rare and depend mostly on luck.",

The hero of this story lives in the town of Thurin, which is somewhat out of the Archmage's range of influence. However, when a gravely wounded kobold delivers a message to him and dies on the threshold of his house, the hero realizes that his long journey has begun - the journey to wake up the slumbering god! Sleeping Gods Lie combines elements of action and adventure-style gameplay. The entire game world is viewed from first person perspective, rendered in \"fake\" 3D. The player explores this world, finding items, solving occasional puzzles, and getting closer to the goal. Enemies will often attack the hero; the key to victory is usually the power of the weapon the hero wields. These can be melee weapons as well as long-ranged ones such as a slingshot. Combat is entirely action-oriented. The game has an internal clock, and the hero can get tired and will have to rest from time to time.",

Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields. In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.",

During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum. Depending on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether. You will need objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters. Some characters are helpful, others are not. But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace. Just be careful not to lose your own head in the process!",

The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match. While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn't buy the Euro Championship license. You'll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the \"Champions of Europe\" title in a nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals. Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at all.",

The player's goal is to guide the ShadowForce team through three missions: Rise of the Overlord, GateKeeper and The Final Paradox. Only the first mission is available in the shareware version of the game. The game is played from the first-person perspective, with static images of each scene the characters find themselves in. Each scene has a text description, and many other events in the game are also presented as text messages. Movement and combat is turn-based, and interaction with the game world is accomplished through a mouse-controlled interface. The gameplay primarily consists of solving puzzles by manipulating items found throughout the game environment, and combat encounters. Occasionally it is also needed to talk to certain non-player characters by typing in keywords to elicit various responses from them. While there is no flow of real time, in some of the phases of the game the player is only able to take a limited number of turns before a certain event happens. Overall, ShadowForce places a greater emphasis on puzzle-solving, however combat also requires the players to cautiously think out their moves, as ammunition and health packs are rather limited.",

This is complicated by the roving of sensor drones, \"x\"s and \"o\"s, who zap the agent and return him to his starting location (a tendency that can be used strategically in times of low oxygen.) The drones can be destroyed with a limited number of Ray-gun blasts, each of which clears the screen of enemies, while weak walls can be demolished through the use of limited supplies of TNT. Finally, the player has a certain quantity of Hints that can be employed in order to indicate where in the larger maze the current section shown on screen is situated. The player can also Teleport randomly around the level in search of his assigned objects, both through a limited personal supply and by finding telepads on the level. Oxygen, TNT, Hints and Ray-gun blasts also can be topped up by finding their power-ups while wandering, as well as the Map Enlarger power-up that briefly increases the amount of the maze that is revealed at once.

The animated intro explains the background story: you play ANSI Dude, who, for unknown reasons, lands his spacecraft on some strange planet and enters a 24-level dungeon. Each dungeon level takes up one screen and is seen from above. Each level is a maze, often filled with enemies; some blocks may be moved, others destroyed, so you can make your way through the maze. Other elements of the maze are conveyor belts, which move you quickly to another position; mines you should avoid; locked doors that can only be opened by key cards you have to collect first, etc. To help you, there are also energy and battery recharge units as well as extra score items and 1-ups. To get to the exit and thus the next level, you have not only to eliminate \"evil entities\", but also solve different puzzles using the four special items at your disposition. These items are: The Suction Cup, which sucks moveable blocks out of nooks and crannies; the Sonic Pickaxe, that breaks destructible walls and moveable blocks; the Plasma Rifle is used to get rid of enemies and set trees on fire, and the Force Field finally allows you to set up a barrier for your enemies. There is a Self-Destruct option, which allows you to restart a level when you get stuck without losing a life. You have to be careful about your resources: each use of one of your special items uses up a certain amount of battery, and, if your battery is depleted, bye-bye! After the first few of them, levels begin to get more complicated, and you will have to think about the right strategy to get through --often, just blowing any moving enemy will just use up all your energy, and it may be better to set up some force fields. The game is entirely controlled by key presses. Gameplay occurs in \"timed delay\" --which means that it is basically turn-based, but if you do nothing for some time, the game still progresses, so you sometimes have to act quick. It also features an in-game help on controls and text character interpretations, as well as a high-score list.",

To help in traversing some of these hazards, as a vampire the player has a limited amount of transformations at their disposal -- the bat can fly over the spikes and around urns, but has to return to human form in order to collect the vials. The puzzles become progressively more elaborate as the player advances through the tower, and new properties of blocks and spikes must be factored into the player's careful planning.",

At the left side of the top of the screen there is the counter for lives and three stars as the energy bar. If the egg touches any of the enemies, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg dies and the player loses a life. On the top-right side there is the accumulated number of coins collected by the character. Giddy can jump and use inventory items. When a light bulb lights up (when Giddy walks over certain spots), pressing enter displays a hint about one of the puzzles. One of the main differences of this installment compared to the previous ones is the addition of side-scrolling instead of the traditional flip-screen. Also, this is the first time in the series that music and sound effects could be played simultaneously.",

Their main method of defense is shooting at enemies, but they can also use melee moves with a chance to evade enemy attacks. Stages also contain obstacles, many of which can be destroyed. Power-ups include weapon upgrades, autofire, and health-restoring food. If a player collects a special ticket in a stage he gains access to a store, where all these items plus upgradeable super-attacks can be bought. Stages usually end with a boss battle.

Donaldson, The Land is a role-playing game where the player will create a character and explore towns, villages and dungeons of The Land. The actual plot of The Land is revealed to the player by playing through the game and no prologue is given. Creating a character is an important part of this game just like many other role-playing games. After picking the age and gender of the character, the player will then determine their class. The classes of The Land are:   * Bloodguard of the Haruchai race, who do not sleep and are fearless  and will run into combat without armor or weapons;   * the Giants who naturally deliver really strong hits;   * Lilianrill, who are devotional to woods and cast wood spells;   * Loreslaat, who are the most powerful but hardest to advance;   * Rhadhamaerl, who are devoted to stones and cast incredible stone  based spells;   * the Ramen, who are tenders of the Ranyhyn the great horses; and   * Warwards, who are the basic fighter class.  All characters are given a service which is their oath to follow throughout the course of the game. If a character behaves against their service they will not advance as well and will be slow to level up. The action of traveling is the same for the combat system. The top-down view of the game allows the player to see explored and unexplored areas. Battles and dungeons are generated randomly. As the player explores the land, the player may suddenly find oneself on a battle field. The enemy will take as many steps as the player does so if the player chooses to run and fight another day it is possible to do so. The player uses a main melee attack and may also bring down a list of spells. Loot left behind after a battle is picked up in the same manner by walking over it. Items left behind and available for purchase or trade are; food, magic items, armor, and weapons.",

By becoming one with this magical device Lord Trentarus would ensure his continued victories over his enemies for eternity. Thus was the Cyan Sarcophagus, the most powerful magical device ever known, constructed. In addition Lord Trentarus had a large crypt built and he left orders that, upon his death he was to be placed in the sarcophagus and that it and his followers were to be sealed in the crypt. The player takes the role of the soldier charged with the task of sealing the crypt and to guard its doors against grave robbers. All has been well for two centuries but now there is a new threat and it is coming from within the tomb, within the sarcophagus! From somewhere a being, a thing that is neither a neither human nor demon, is using the sarcophagus to try to enter your world. Taking advantage of the weakness in the ethereal plane that exists around all grave sites, it has succeeded in sending some of its minions through. Soon it will attempt to come through itself! The game starts with the player, a skeleton with little memory of who he has been, falling into the crypt. There he learns that many followers have perished or become unstable due to the boredom that the dead must endure. The player must negotiate the labyrinthine crypt, avoiding all the traps that were set for the grave robbers, and defeat the monster and its minions. This game is entirely keyboard controlled.",

The game comes with two large fold-out maps and tokens to be moved around the map, as well as a dozen booklets containing text passages to be read when the game tells you to do so (much like the early Epyx Dunjonquest games). When starting play, you can choose one to six players from preset character. The interesting thing is that the characters are meant to be played by separate players, sitting together in front of the computer, as in a pen & paper RPG. The difference is that there is no party, as each player has different tasks and missions and moves around independent of the others. When playing, each player moves his token on the map, then enters the movements and actions into the program, which calculates all changes to character stats and inventory, calculates combat, and tells the player which text passage to read. While progressing, the players will make new discoveries, battle aliens, trade with other players and NPCs, and discover the plot of the game.",

All these moves deplete a special energy bar, which gradually refills itself. The player can select between three fire rates, which influence the speed of the regeneration. When in mecha form the ship can fire straight and spreading shots typical for shoot-em-ups. However, the normal form relies exclusively on homing weapons that hit multiple enemies but cannot target individual enemies directly. Switching between these two forms is essential to survival.",

After the egg has hatched the parent buzzards swoop down to pick up humans to feed to their young. The player must protect the humans by shooting the buzzards.

The player must move through a screen filled with penguins while collecting all three parts of the ship to gain an extra life. The penguins are harmless but bumping into them makes the player bounce around like a pinball.

Alphagrammar: In this game, the computer will generate a sentence and show you empty spaces where the letters should be. At the top of the screen, the alphabet is listed along with the number of each letter that appears in the sentence. From these clues your goal is to fill in all the letters of the sentence in the shortest time possible.    Cryptogrammar: In this game, the computer will present you with a jumbled sentence where each letter has been substituted with another letter. To solve the cryptogram you will need to flip letters around, swap the order of letters, or move letters to a new space until you have correctly created the sentence.

By becoming one with this magical device Lord Trentarus would ensure his continued victories over his enemies for eternity. Thus was the Cyan Sarcophagus, the most powerful magical device ever known, constructed. In addition Lord Trentarus had a large crypt built and he left orders that, upon his death he was to be placed in the sarcophagus and that it and his followers were to be sealed in the crypt. The player takes the role of the soldier charged with the task of sealing the crypt and to guard its doors against grave robbers. After two centuries a being known as 'The Null Beast' took advantage of the weakness in the ethereal plane that exists around all grave sites and tried to break through into this world from another plane of existence. It was thwarted but it has not given up and now its back again. As before the game starts with the player, a skeleton with little memory of who he has been, falling into the crypt. There he learns of the new peril from his old companion Skellion and sets out deeper into the crypt to vanquish the beast once and for all. Skull Quest II was designed to be a tougher game than its predecessor with more illusionary walls and many more objects being hidden or harder to reach. This game is entirely keyboard controlled.",

Points are awarded for correctly identifying loners; each round contains a goal score, so even if the player completes a round without losing all three lives the goal still needs to be met to proceed onto the next round.

In the single loner challenge there will be only one loner in the set; the goal is to identify it as quickly as possible. A correct choice earns bonus points, or the round ends when an incorrect selection is made or time runs out. In the matchmaker challenge, there are nine items displayed; the player needs to find out which item matches the one displayed in the center of the board. Correct choices earn bonus points.

The game options are to play against the computer or take turns playing against another player. There is also an option to adjust the colours of the game board and stones.",

Orion Odyssey is a platform action game story told in eight parts. As Wally you must monitor your four stats; health, oxygen, fuel, and ammo while taking on the robots and aliens strewn across and beneath the landscape. You are equipped with a blaster weapon and a jetpack which besides walking around is your primary mode of transportation. The jetpack is your only means of leaping so keep an eye on that fuel gauge. Your weapons can be upgraded by finding artifacts and pressing the appropriate key to unlocking their powers. Fuel canisters, shields and health power-ups are also laid out all over the landscape you play in. You will also see that there is a Gold gauge which you'll need to collect so that you may purchase necessities from pods you may run into. Alien and robotic foes aren't your only concern when it comes to keeping your health gauge up as flying too quickly into a wall will also cause damage or may even kill. Flying the jetpack requires practice and skill. A meter gauge shows the amount of inertia you have left so the jetpack will not allow you to fly across the entire level. Once the artifacts of a certain world have been collected you must return to the teleporter you started at to continue onto the next world. Other worlds will present different terrains and alien species and varying levels of oxygen density so remember to keep an eye on that oxygen gauge.",

At that time in the Earth's history a terrible plague known as the Nagroma, swept the land at the start of winter killing every living thing it encountered. With the aid of the Inovar the Eharin were able to create a protective barrier that kept the plague at bay. However the barrier, the Cairnrue, did not just keep the plague at bay, it stopped everything, so every spring the Rite of Decairn had to be performed to allow rain to fall. This rite has been performed for many years by Varwield Arthermin who has grown old and bitter. The last time he raised the Cairnrue, Arhermin tried to keep its power for himself. He was defeated by Kiron the Protector in a great battle during which a shard was split from the great stone of Inovar. Kiron took the stone and fled over the Adklaart Mire where, it is rumoured, he is now trapped by Arthermin's soldiers. Arthermin kept the shard and used its power to create the Naslava, creatures from the Earth's core, to protect him. This brought him into conflict with Rimarlion, Daughter of the Earth, whom he defeated and turned to stone. Before her fall Rimarlion entrusted her sacred amulet to the Laryx people of Mount Hiakron who in turn entrusted it to Sunquat, Leader of the Eharin, People of the Light. The player enters the game as Varwield Secunda, chosen by your people to serve under Arthermin as his apprentice. For years you have served him but now, as storm clouds gather and the rainfall is absorbed by the Cairnrue, the time has come for the Rite of Decairn to be performed and that task falls on your shoulders. Shard of Inovar a multi-platform, icon driven, text adventure game with graphics. It can be played with a keyboard or with a joystick. Instead of typing in 'Go North', 'Get item' and so on the player selects an appropriate icon from the panels that are above, below, and at either side of the screen. Another helpful feature is the 'Give item to person' icon which, when invoked, allows the player to select an item from the inventory and then highlights words from the last displayed piece of text for the player to select. This allows the player to select a person from their group without the need to spell all their names correctly every time.",

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games. Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.",

Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state. Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.",

A new addition is the ability to change altitude. The game consists of several missions, each with a specific goal like destroying an enemy cruiser or power plant or defending an airfield from enemy fighters. Before a mission, the Harrier can be armed with a variety of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles as well as two types of bombs. Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission's end. Sometimes it is also possible to make a mid-mission resupply landing at a friendly base.",

To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep. If they don't get enough food then eventually they die. The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles. Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches. Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling. There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.",

You are not limited to freehand drawing - lines, boxes, circles and curves can be drawn, with variable ink colours and line thickness.

While having a drink in one of the local pubs, you got into a conversation with a fellow who had obviously been drinking too much. During the conversation he made several references to a secret installation on Mars, and the alien artifact within it. After that night you spent six month and most of your money to track down the truth to this rumor. You found a member of the third martian expedition, the expedition that found the artifact, who tells you the story about it. It looks like a large vid-phone booth, but with a single lever inside it instead of a phone. It turns out that this seems to be a sort of teleporter, sending things to random, far of locations. Some locations are so far away that it takes radio waves five or eight years to reach the earth. The WorldGow got scared and suppressed the story and a guarded building was constructed around the artifact. You set of to mars aboard a supply ship for the only guard at the installation. The ship did not land at the artifact and most of your equipment was lost during a sand storm. You are now in the middle of the martian desert and you have to find your way to the installation and see what you can do with the artifact.",

Apart of this and the slightly unusual menu-based user interface, the game is a quite typical traditional. The game starts at the main menu, where you'll first have to assemble a party. You can create character by choosing a race (six races available), a class (one of four classes, but there are four more classes in the game) and an alignment (D&D like, plus an \"Amoral\" alignment) and then distributing some points on some class-determined stats. Each character is already quite well equipped, so you can immediately start exploring the dungeons, but you can also spend some money buying better stuff. The dungeons appear in usual roguelike manner -- top-down view in ASCII graphics. You move through rooms and corridors, occasionally meeting groups of monsters which results in a turn-based combat. During combat, you have the possibilities to fight, cast a spell, use an item, parry or run. You may stumble upon several groups of monsters at once, like 4 skeletons and 2 gromes, in which case you'll have to choose whom to attack first, which gives the combat a tactical touch. When you won a fight, you get experience and gold. The dungeons also feature some special locations like traps, shops and a review board, the latter revealing another specialty of Evets, which is switching character classes during the game. Despite its unusual and promising features, the game has a quite cumbersome and non-standard interface which makes it difficult to handle. For example, spells you want to cast have to be entered by full name, which is somewhat cumbersome as some spell's name have been abbreviated (\"Magic missle\"), but at least, the last entered spell is the default.",

The player uses the arrow keys to make Serguei walk, and types any commands to to interact with the game, such as \"open door\", \"get star\" and so on.

It gained control over its operator and began to influence other employees. Your mission is to find the main frame, defeat the operator and return to the lobby alive. Mission: Mainframe is a shareware variation of Wizard's Castle, a mix of a board game and role-playing, set in a bizarre contemporary / sci-fi environment. Before beginning the game, you first create your character. You may choose one of four character types which differ in their D&D-like vital stats. As in other RPGs, the stats may be increased by gathering experience. You then start in the lobby of the corporation, where you can buy some basic equipment by spending chips and bytes (instead of gold) on such useful items as Junk Food (which is very important, otherwise you'll starve quickly), Strategies (corresponding to magic spells in fantasy RPGs) and Office Supplies (replace weapons and armor, thus assisting you in dealing with reluctant corporate employees). Other things you can do in the lobby is go the Health Club, where you can build up your stats, as well as restore your Power & Plans (the power level represents hit points, and plans are needed to use strategies -- e.g., spell points). Finally, you can start the real game by taking the elevator to other floors. The company is located in a thirty floor building. Each floor is divided into an 8x8 grid of squares. Each square may contain something, like employees you have to deal with, or file cabinets which may contain helpful items. As the contents of the squared is determined randomly at the beginning, each game is different. Depending on the difficulty level you chose at the beginning of the game, you can see the contents of the squares, or you have to move onto it to know what it contains. When you meet an employee, you can deal with him in several ways, for example trying to bribe him, fight him, use a strategy, evade him, trick him, or try to distract him by making a phone call. The success of all these actions depends on different statistics, both of you and the employee. There are 24 different types of employees, and it's your task to find out how best to deal with each of them. When you successfully deal with an employee, you gain experience and can raise your grade (level), which increases your survival chances in the higher floors, where the employees get more and more powerful. The file cabinets may contain chips and bytes as well as items like office supplies or beverages. Some of those are helpful, some are harmful (poison) -- and some can make you drunk. Luckily, you can first take a sip from a drink, getting a hint about what it may be. As some cabinets are trapped, you also should be careful with them. The task is complicated by the lights which sometimes go out. To restore light, you have to light a match (which can be taken from some employees) and find a fuse box. Also, you have to get special key cards to get beyond floor 10 and floor 20 by defeating bosses who guard them. At any time, you can get back to the elevator and lobby, where you can sell your treasures, rest and buy new supplies. You can also quit the game here, getting the opportunity to save your character first.",

In this platform shooter the player guides Van Slug through fairly vast levels populated by ground-based and flying enemies. The hero's default gun with unlimited ammunition can be exchanged for stronger ones (but with limited ammo) by picking a correspondent power-up. Other power-ups include shields that further protect the hero from attacks, dynamite, and health-restoring items. A boss battle awaits Van Slug at the end of each stage. Even though a bar entitled \"EXP\" is displayed alongside with the protagonist's health and special ammunition gauges, it never fills up and remains empty for the duration of the game.",

Navigating this tricky scenario is achieved with the assistance of Raiythius, a sassy Zen hellhound sidekick with a penchant for conveying enlightenment through physical pain and micturition. While the setting of this text adventure is quite explicitly and thoroughly Japanese, the game boasts even stranger cameo appearances than previous Panks games, including a suffering Jesus of Nazareth at the start screen, Bruce Lee as the shopkeeper (with Mr. Miyagi in the eaves) and founding father Ben Franklin, murdered for cheating in a gambling game with Wyatt Earp and his posse at the Oibara Inn. All this plus the game's author himself (hinting at some bizarre post-modern denouement) as the frontman for the house band the Singing Nobunagas! The gameplay is largely a matter of roving between areas picking up that which is not nailed down and killing that which can be overcome through physical combat (but now nearly featuring -- see trivia -- an alchemical magic system of sorts).",

The game is split into three tasks, broadly relating to animal, vegetable and mineral in that order. The first involves defeating an evil witch, the second is the Riddle of the Shrinking Teapot, and the third involves precious stones. Commands such as FOLLOW, FIND and GO TO make travelling the game world much easier, and put an emphasis on object-manipulation and character interaction, rather than map-making. Instructions can be issued to other characters, with words like THEN, FIND and GIVE to join them. This co-operation is essential to solve many puzzles, and takes place in a world where characters have their own aims and motives. There are BRIEF and VERBOSE modes of text. A running joke in the game is that the screen display adds a 'g' to the start of all words beginning with n - 'gnorth' and 'gnugget' for example. Graphics are included in the disk versions of the game, except in the ports for Atari 8-bit and Apple II, which are text-only on every media.",

Points are scored based on the values on the dominoes and whether the tile covers a bonus square. The game is entirely mouse controlled. Tiles are dragged & dropped onto the game area. The right mouse button moves the tile in a vertical position while the left rotates the tile 90 degrees so that it can be dropped in its horizontal position. There are three types of game available.   * The solo game where the player plays by themselves to put a fixed  number of tiles on the board.   * Playing against the computer to place a fixed number of tiles on  the board   * Playing against the computer with no tile limit. In this game the  player can select from three levels of intelligence for the  computer opponent  All player moves must be made within a time limit. The game holds the top sixty player scores for each type of game. Other features of the game are its music sound track a 'Peek' button which shows the player a possible next move, though this does cost points when used), and a 'Pass this turn' button.

If the player elects to move, say, upwards then if there is another star directly above then the star the player controls becomes that other star. If there is no star directly above then the star the player controls moves upwards one position. By jumping around the screen in this manner the player can ensure that their star is always surrounded by stars to kill. Aside from stars re-forming within the star field, the curved nature of space is a further complication. In this game it means that antiparticles fired off the edge of the screen in one direction can come back on the other side. The players star is, of course, vulnerable to their own fire.

You play with a 3-D view from a hovercraft in an attempt to destroy all alterants and stop the drug runs they make. The story is slightly different in Resolution 101. This game is set in the USA in the city of Las Envegas. Crime is rife and law enforcement just cannot cope so in 2038 a new law, Resolution 101, was passed which allows convicted felons to be released from jail in return for tracking down and eliminating gangland bosses. The player takes the role of one of these 'Search and Destroy' criminals. They are given a Theta 4000 ground skimmer armed with a light machine gun and they play their way through a series of increasingly difficult levels. Each level starts with a meeting with the sheriff who names the new target. After that the player is in their skimmer patrolling the streets shooting things, not mind controlled alterants but the drug runner's henchmen and gangland minions (same sprites different names). The city of Las Envegas is divided into four areas each of which is controlled by a separate drug runner. The during the course of the game's twelve levels the player must defeat each runner three times in order to finally kill them. The runners have minions who will attack the player as they pursue their quest for justice / freedom. As these are destroyed they leave behind cash and drugs that can be collected, the drugs must be collected as evidence. As a further complication the drug runner only makes a few runs through the city in each level so the player must collect the evidence and shoot them down before the last run is complete, otherwise the sheriff will be displeased and the player will lose a life. Around the city are three shops where the player can upgrade weapons, and repair shields or their skimmer.",

Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout. The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.",

Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.",

The game offers two different game modes, \"Going Up\" and \"Heading Out\", the difference is how the exit and the game field looks like. In \"Going Up\" you heading for stairs which lead to the next level. In \"Heading Out\", you just head for an open tunnel which will lead to the next level. \"Going Up\" offers three different difficulties, which will effect the complexity of the level, not only the size, but also the amount of puzzle elements. In each difficulty you can play 10 different levels. \"Heading Out\" has only one difficulty, easy, but has 31 levels in a row. You do not need to solve a level in order to get to the next, all 61 levels are accessible directly from the main menu. In the levels itself, you need to move around wooden crates in many different sizes and forms, some are only in the way to the exit (and you must get around), but some others are needed to cross water. In addition there are gearwheels in the level, from two-arms to full four-arms. You need them to rotate in order to get somewhere, or to make room for a crate to move. Furthermore, there are sometimes solid obstacles in the level, where you can end up with a crate in a dead end... If you fail the level and can't reach the exit, you can easily restart it, and play it so long how you want. On a few levels, you aren't alone, there are sometimes multiple Kwirks, all under your control, positioned at different places in the level. In this case one Kwirk needs another to complete the level, but all Kwirks must reach the exit, if not, you've failed the level.",

When the button is depressed, the wurm gets a buzz and adjusts its course to counter its downward motion and start heading up; when the button is released, gravity resumes its normal pull -- maintaining a constant course is hence very tricky and the player is much more likely to leave a trail looking something like a sine wave.

Clearing a set of spiky pieces gets a triangle piece, and clearing a set of those gets a star piece. This is kind of like going up in levels.

For once, Relentless Logic actually has a bombastic patriotic background story: You play a private of the US marines who must get an important message over a mine field. The future of America is in your hands -- handle with care. As in Minesweeper, the game is played on a rectangular grid. Several mines are hidden on the grid, and from the displayed number of mines in the neighboring fields, you need to guess where the mines actually are. Unlike the Windows game, however, the task here is not to clear the whole field, but to trace a path from the upper left to the lower right of the field. You also can not set markers to remember the position of identified mines, which makes the game somewhat harder. The game is always played on a fixed field, but you can choose the number of hidden mines. Time is counted in seconds, not steps, and this is the base of your \"Skill Rating\" when successfully finishing the game. When stepping on a mine, your character is blown to bits by a sequence of ASCII explosions and PC beeper bleeps, which adds some lovely cheesy gore.",

The ship is controlled by the numeric keypad and can move up / down, left / right. The maze is very congested and it is hard to find a way through. Fortunately the ship has a supply of missiles with which the obstacles can be removed. Unfortunately new obstacles appear at random around the screen so a clear path can sometimes become blocked. Additionally some obstacles reflect the missiles back onto the ship and destroy it. The numeric keypad cannot move the ship when it is faced with a returning missile but there is a 'get out of jail' key and that's F10 - the 'Panic Reverse' button. This will take the ship part of the way back along its current track and if its turned at least one corner recently then the missile will sail past. When the player completes a level they are treated to an animated hyper drive acceleration & deceleration sequence before starting the next level. The whole game comprises nine levels.",

The player clicks on a cell and the tile is turned over revealing a colour, a letter, or a number etc depending on the game. The player then clicks on another cell and this turns over also revealing a colour, letter etc. If the two tiles do not match the game resets them to their un-revealed state and the player tries again. If the two tiles match they the player is rewarded with a message 'Well done' type of message and the tiles remain face up. The player then repeats the process until all matching pairs have been revealed. There are four types of game on offer here;   * Colours.  A simple game where the player must match pairs of tiles containing  the same colour. Each colour has its name written on the tile and  this helps teach spelling and word recognition.   * Letters  In this game the player must match the upper case letter to the  appropriate lower case letter   * Maths  Here the player can select from addition, subtraction, division,  multiplication, addition and subtraction or a mixed set of  problems. The player then selects a difficulty level. The game is  to match the sum to the correct answer.   * Pictures  The player matches tiles with the same picture on them. There are  no words on these tiles, just pictures.  Each game starts out with a grid that is 2 cells by 4 cells. When that has been completed the game advances to the next level which is 2 cells by 4 cells and so on through grids that are 4 x 4, 4 x 5, to the final level which is 5 x 6 after which the game reverts to a 2 x 4 grid.

If you are able to complete a square with that line, then you get to place another line. Every time you create a square, you get to place another line. When you cannot create another square, your opponent takes a turn. In the beginning, you are mostly just placing lines here and there where you feel it is best. Once you can no longer place more lines without giving your opponent the opportunity to create a square, then the game gets challenging as you must find out how to let your opponent get as few squares as possible while getting as many squares as you can for yourself.",

The goal is simple: choose the traits of Moppet creatures to line up in a queue, obeying the given number of rules. For instance, if the rule says \"2,\" you must choose the traits of the next Moppet so that it differs from the previous Moppet by 2 traits, e.g. a fat, blue Moppet can stand next to a thin, red Moppet. The number of rules, i.e. traits, can be changed from 1 to 4, thus either making the game more or less challenging (although changing the traits to 4, the maximum, will just result in your Moppets being an alternate sequence of two types of Moppets).",

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity. Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.",

(Too bad there are also an infinite amount of enemies!) Most of what Harry hunts is fuel tanks, which the Druts have stolen from the village to further their gold-mining activities, and his primary objective is to collect them and return them to the village... though he also scores points for gathering whatever gold he finds (ditto for the new \"Beamer\" bonus), destroying Druts and simply exploring up and down the ladders of this over-200-screen complex. In addition to the Druts who pursue to the edge of the screen and kill on contact, Harry is somewhat fragile and loses a man through the smallest tumble off a ledge or through a gap in a platform; also venturing underwater or hanging out near a lava flow for too long will both result in the loss of a life.",

The catch is if you roll the same number as one of the blockers (it's possible, but unlikely, for both blockers to be the same number), you don't get points for that die and can no longer roll it. If you keep rolling until you roll all blockers, you get zero points for that round. You may stop at any time. There are a total of five rounds. The player with the highest total for the game wins. For example, assume 2 and 5 are your blockers. On your first roll, you roll 3, 5, 4, 1, and 3. You get 11 points (3 + 4 + 1 + 3) and the die you rolled a 5 on is removed from play. Your next roll, you roll 2, 3, 5, and 5. Your total is now 14 (11 + 3), but you've only got one die left to roll. This is a good time to stop! (Don't push your luck too much.) The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of \"ANSI characters,\" which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have.

The player can choose between the male (Jean) and female (Houn) protagonists, who defend their homeland against an onslaught of mechanized creatures. Both characters can shoot in eight directions and begin with two weapons, a machine gun and a shotgun. Throughout the game they gain access to special weapons which can be obtained by shooting robots that carry them. Jean can use a laser gun, homing laser balls, and the powerful Exploder; Houn is able to wield a flamethrower, a napalm thrower, and homing grenades. A few stages differ depending on the character chosen by the player. Stages typically culminate with boss battles.",

Since you're not in the best of shapes to be traipsing around an alien ship you can look death in the eye and use the clone maker aboard the ship which will generate a new you every time you're offed. Your clones can't think for themselves and need simple instructions to do any task so it's up to you to give them the right phrases and directions while they search the alien ship. Remember to save your progress as you go along. Marooned Again is a text adventure taking place in the winding and twisting corridors of an alien ship and the land surrounding it. Use directional commands such as U for up or W for West to direct the way you'd like your clone to move. Simple two-word phrases like Examine or Take will help you interact with the world around you. Your progress can and should be saved often and and inventory is available to the player by pressing the letter I.

Those blocks can be moved in any direction, but they automatically move into the chosen direction until they meet an obstacle, e.g. a wall or another block. In contrast to Atomix, the goal is not to create a shape but to vaporize all blocks with the usual tile-matching method: two or more blocks of the same colour disappear when they touch. Each level has to be solved within a certain time frame and a limited amount of bombs can be used to kill off single blocks. Multiplayer is always turn-based, but there is a choice if the turns are inside the level (i.e. the first player moves one block, then the second the next block and so on) or outside (i.e. the first player solves the level and then the second player gets a shot at it).",

Once a digit is selected, it cannot be used on subsequent rolls in the current round. When the player cannot select digits totaling the dice roll, the round is over. The player scores points equal to the sum of the digits used that round. If the player successfully uses all nine digits, they get five bonus points for a total of 50 points for the round. The game consists of five rounds and, naturally, the player with the highest score wins. The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of \"ANSI characters,\" which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have. Simple sound is provided by the PC speaker.",

One day, Herbert suddenly disappears, with rumors saying the he left his wife and son behind to search for a lost treasure. Meanwhile, a magical wand called Eveline decides to rule the world out of boredom, using Bert to cast a petrifying spell on the marionettes of a traveling puppeteer and cause other mischief among the local population. Now, Bert must fix all the trouble caused by Eveline, and search for his missing father. Draci Historie is a Czech point-and-click adventure game, originally the first Czech CD game ever to be published in 1995, and later released as open-source freeware in 2006 by the original developer. It follows the standards of the genre, where the main objective is to collect a series of scenery objects and use them to solve puzzles. The inventory shows the interior of a brown sack, and can be accessed by placing the cursor on the top of the screen. A map showing an overhead view of the land can be summoned by positioning the cursor at the bottom. New places are automatically added to the map as the player explores the surroundings, allowing instantaneous travel to any of the previously visited locations. The dialogue with other characters uses the branching tree system implemented by several other games, where multiple questions and answers appear listed as options at the bottom and the player has to select one of them. There is no menu with verbs, instead all the actions are performed with the right mouse button, while the left one is used to get descriptions of objects and portions of the scenery.",

A number on the platform indicates how much points it is worth and this amount will be added to the players score when it drops out of the screen. In addition to standard platform blocks with numbers on them there are ones with a question mark (gives a random number of points) and ones with a red devil (moves to adjacent free spaces). To make the game more interesting there are several bonus items:   * Paint bucket: Allows the player to paint platform blocks  permanently. The opponent can not change the color.   * Lightning bolt: The player will move twice as fast.   * Glue bottle: Grants the ability to glue the other player to the  ground.   * Bomb: Destroys a number of platform blocks.   * Magnet: Allows the player to move platform blocks to free places by  jumping out in the air.  There are two ways to win the game: Get the most points or kill the opponent three times.",

Beginning at the entrance to the nuclear plant, you must make your way through the maze-like building to the control room at the center. Your task would be hard enough if you only had to navigate the maze, but on top of that, the plant's V7734 model security robots have gone haywire, and if they catch you, they'll zap you back to the beginning of the maze. Heavy Water Jogger is a game where you can't lose. Even if you run out of health or time, the game will simply pretend the whole thing never happened, and start over from the beginning. (For this reason, the game also doesn't allow you to save your game at any point.)

The players take turns placing these tiles onto a seven-by-nine grid, but tiles can only be placed next to one another if their touching sides have the same numeric value. Fortunately, tiles can be rotated to find the best possible fit. Every time a tile is put down, the player that placed it scores a number of points equal to the number of sides touching tiles already on the board multiplied by the values of those sides. Certain areas of the board are marked as BONUS or MINUS squares -- placing a tile on one of these causes a player to immediately gain or lose twenty points. The game supports player vs. player, player vs. computer and computer vs. computer play, and it also has three difficulty levels. Higher difficulty levels feature a greater variety of tiles for players to cope with. In-game hints are available if needed.",

This snake can travel in one direction at a time, and must continue uninterrupted until it encounters an obstacle, at which point it has the option of changing its direction. Fortunately, the screen is randomly littered with scattered red blocks, and gameplay largely consists of plotting a continuous course along the contours of these blocks. Subsequent (infinite) levels (with a bonus challenge round every 10) incorporate differently-coloured blocks, which modify gameplay in various ways -- altering the time remaining positively or negatively, teleporting the snake to a random location, becoming a necessary checkpoint en route to the gate, or just terminating the snake. (Typically the snake will die only upon reaching the time limit or being trapped in an enclosed space by its own tail, which gets longer (unlike the goal, which gets shorter) and more in the way with every level successfully completed.)",

Ingrid has three cunning plans to stop him - producing a petition with everybody's signature, finding a more orthodox prevention method, and finally infiltrating Ridley's Manor itself by pretending to be a maid, and then finding proof that he's a dodgy geezer who should be locked up. These three quests can be played in any order, although they logically follow on from each other. She is accompanied by Flopsy the dog in the first 2 parts, and her cousin Daisy in the third. Ingrid's Back! uses the same game system as the original, and other contemporary Level 9 titles such as Knight Orc . Giving instructions to other characters (including Flopsy) and jumping around the map using GO TO and FOLLOW commands. A living and breathing world of people travelling, trading and relaxing underpins it all, and plays a part in most puzzles. The disk versions of the game contain graphics, the exception being the ports for Apple II and Atari 8-bit, which are text-only.",

However, it is important that the player took repair parts and fuel (which can be chosen after the qualifying race) with them. There are six courses and an editor to create more.",

Basically you have to blast your way through or fly (jump) through treacherous terrain: water and bamboo sticks are one of many terrain types that can kill your character. Blasted monsters turn into 'bonus fruit' (yes, fruit) of which you can obtain for additional points.

With the space station at the center of the screen, the player uses the mouse to move a torpedo cursor around. Press the mouse button, and the station will fire a torpedo to that location where it will explode and take out any surrounding enemies. However, the torpedoes have to travel a bit before they reach their destination so the player has to take this into account when aiming at the moving aliens. In each level, a refueling ship flies toward the space station and the player must protect it from incoming enemies. Once at the center, the ship docks with the space station and the player is rewarded with extra fuel. The levels face increasingly more difficult waves of enemies. The first 10 levels introduce all the enemy types, and each level after that features various combinations of aliens.",
