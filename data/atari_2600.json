It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F game console.[CR]The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, which stood for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the \"Atari 2600\", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge, initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.[CR]Developer:  Atari[CR]Manufacturer:  Atari[CR]CPU:  MOS Technology 6507[CR]Memory:  128 bytes RAM[CR]Graphics:  128-color palette[CR]Sound:  Television Interface Adaptor[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3\u00d73 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.",

Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands.

When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.[CR]A bonus item occasionally appears.[CR]After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway.

Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II.

Then try the Ramp Jump. It's the jump that's just a bit wider than the Grand Canyon. If there's a more dangerous challenge open to daredevil BMX bikers, we have yet to test it.

Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of \"Fast run time\" (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who's chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game's catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.",

                "plot": "Ahh Cabbage Patch Kids.  Who could forget those chubby little dolls that started fist fights between middle aged housewives in toy stores?  For some reason every kid had to have one of these creepy little kewpie dolls back in the 80's, although the fad eventually faded.  Since Cabbage Patch Kids just happened to be manufactured by Coleco, it was only natural that they would create a video game tie in.  While the Colecovision version of Cabbage Patch Kids was released to much success, the Atari 2600 version never materialized.[CR]If you're scratching your head as to how someone could create a game based on a line of dolls, you're not alone.  Dolls don't exactly inspire video games.  However Coleco got around this by taking an existing game for the MSX line of computers called Athletic Land and adding the Cabbage Patch Kids into the game.  Since the MSX computer was never released in the US, people were none the wiser.  This is also why a game that was supposedly aimed at children seems so damn hard.[CR]Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park (which will be henceforth referred to as CPK) is a side scrolling action game.  According to the Colecovision version's manual, Anna Lee has decided to go out for some exercise in the local park and is soon caught up in a wild adventure (hence the subtitle Adventures in the Park).  The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome.  Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires.  Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out.  Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win.[CR]CPK was known to exist for some time thanks to an interview conducted with another former Coleco programmer Ed English several years ago.  Ed was thought to be in possession of the only known prototype, but he would not release it for unknown reasons.  However in 2008 several Coleco EPROMs were found in a flea market, several of which contained various versions of CPK.  These EPROMs were released to the public shortly afterwards.[CR]While it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of CPK is an amazing feat of programming.  Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games.  It appears that CPK was simply a victim of the collapsing game market, and by the time the final version was ready in September of 1984, Coleco had stopped its 2600 operations.",

You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks \"fall\" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.[CR]Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a \"miss indicator\" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.[CR]Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.[CR]GAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. [CR]Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's \"miss indicator\" as well as your own.  Bombs away![CR]GAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)[CR]This one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay \"suspended\" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.[CR]GAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.[CR]GAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.[CR]No \"miss indicator\" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.[CR]GAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.[CR]SEA BOMBER GAMES[CR]GAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)[CR]You're playing against the computer.

In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.[CR]Environments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used \u2014 three hits and the player loses a life \u2014 while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.[CR]The game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.[CR]The game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the \"Games That Weren't\" section.",

                "plot": "Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's \"ABC's to the VCS\" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.[CR]Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. [CR]Moving the pieces is also an unusual process.  Each player controls a bar which runs horizontally across the width of the playfield.  You must place the bar over the piece that you wish to move.  You must then press the red firing button once if you wish to move a pawn and twice if you want to move your captain.  Once your piece is 'locked in' you can move it either horizontally or vertically.  However your piece cannot move over a spot which is already occupied by another piece.  Your Captain has the ability to move into a space occupied by one of your opponent's pawns.  If this occurs, you will send his pawn back to its starting position. [CR]While you move your pieces, you'll constantly use up your energy which is monitored at the top and bottom of the screen.  When you are completely out of energy you'll be immobilized for three seconds, allowing your opponent to move pieces without any trouble.  At the end of the three seconds, your energy will be completely recharged.  Throughout the game a pod will move around the playfield with the letter 'E' flashing on and off.  If you touch it while the letter appears you'll be receive a full supply of energy no matter how much you might have remaining.[CR]Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/confrontation/confrontation.htm",

A succession of alien spacecraft and creatures take center stage in the middle of the screen, and players must line the two cannons up to most efficiently deal with all of the enemies while also using the smallest amount of fuel possible (end-to-end sweeps of the screen, while deadly and impressive, simply aren't practical). Some of the enemies, not content to just be evasive, return fire, providing another way for the player's cannons to be destroyed.",

You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.",

The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks.",

Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.",

Another version of the game was released by Bit Corporation under the name Dancing Plates which features oriental-themed graphics and adds eight game variations.[CR]Dishaster was inspired by the circus tradition of keeping spinning plates suspended on poles. The player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling. The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony.[CR]The girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears at the top of the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground",

Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...[CR]You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:[CR]THE SEAGULL:  [CR]Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.[CR]THE SLIP:  [CR]Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him \"the slip\".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.[CR]SCORING:  [CR]Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.[CR]Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.",

The object of the game is pretty straightforward- you must traverse up through Hazzard county (a layout of nearly 11 screens) and reach the jail before Boss Hog catches up with Daisy, as shown at the top of the screen. Pushing UP applies the gas and LEFT/RIGHT controls the steering. Rosco (in his police car) chases you throughout the county in an effort to stop you (you\u2019ll hear his police siren when he\u2019s near); if caught, you\u2019ll lose one of your 4 cars, and start over at the bottom of the course. Nails can be found along the way and used to temporarily disable Rosco\u2019s cruiser. However, they can damage your car\u2019s tires just as easily, so you must drive very slowly over them to safely pick them up. Pressing the FIRE button drops the nails. You have another advantage in that your car can move diagonally (Rosco\u2019s can\u2019t). A good tip for the higher levels is to keep his car in sight behind you while moving up. If he scrolls off the screen, he\u2019ll possibly reappear right in front of you!",

Unfortunately Gary and Bruce had only gone through the brainstorming process when work was stopped.

Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.",

Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.[CR]The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.[CR]During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.[CR]Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  [CR]To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.

                "plot": "Talk about a game with convoluted history!  It was once thought that Spinning Fireball, along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief, were all original games developed by a PAL company called Suntek.  However after much research it has been determined that these are in fact original NTSC games released by two different companies called Zimag and Vidco, which may have been related somehow.  So why were these games developed for the NTSC market but never released?  Read on to find out.[CR]Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.[CR]The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level. [CR]While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).[CR]While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.",

There you must prevent him from completing his creation.[CR]Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.[CR]You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.[CR]You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points",

Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. [CR]The game has nice, clean graphics.  The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad.  Each frog even has its own realistic \"ribbet\" sound.  The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue.  Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out.  The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B).  There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions.  You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit.  Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects.  There are five types of insects.  Since the game has no manual, I created names for each type:",

                "plot": "Frogs and Flies is a 1982 video game by Mattel for the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 platforms. In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.[CR]Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen \u2013 the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a \"The End\" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.[CR]There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water \u2013 in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.[CR]A version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.",

It was one of the first video games to feature a ground combat theme and grenades.[citation needed] Military-oriented video games of the early 1980s usually involved vehicular combat, such as tanks, but did not include infantry. The original arcade version of Front Line consists of a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button, which fires the weapon. The single button is used to throw grenades, and to enter and exit the tank.[CR]1985's Ikari Warriors follows the conventions established by Front Line, including the vertically scrolling levels, entering/exiting tanks, and not dying when an occupied tank is destroyed.",

You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.[CR]As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker.

With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of \"mood slime.\" Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's \"courage\" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up \"elixir\" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of \"mood slime\" to keep the statue moving.",

If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.Difficulty switchesUse the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.Game variationsThere are five games, each with five skill levels.The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.Skill levels for one player games-Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)Skill level 2=132 secondsSkill level 3=39 secondsSkill level 4=26 secondsSkill level 5=random timesFor two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.The games are-Game 1 (Billboard)- After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.Game 2 (Skill Builder)- Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.Game 3 (Times Up)- You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.Game 4 (Encore)- The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.Game 5 (Over the Edge)- Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.",

The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.",

In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save.

This shows you, the aliens, the meteorites and, if you run into it, the super alien. On the bottom left is the remaining ships (lives) On the bottom right is the velocity indicator. On the bottom center is the long range scanner. This shows you, the aliens and the super alien, but not the meteorites.[CR]As the super alien approaches, there will be an alarm sound. If the super alien catches you, you will be unable to move or fire and will lose a life. The game ends if you lose all your lives or get 999,999 points.",

The gremlins then march down toward you. You must shoot them before they reach and kill poor Billy. You have two flash cubes that you can use to scare them away if they get too close. Bright Light!

After being booted from the egg catch, Grover was given the music maker gig (displacing one very upset monkey).  For you see Grover's Music Maker was originally called Monkey Music and featured a dancing monkey instead of the jumping blue hairball you see today.  What does Grover have to do with music you ask?

To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.",

                "plot": "Your character starts at the lower left of a multi-tiered screen and must make his way to the beautiful(?) woman to the right, however you'll soon find out that someone is out to stop your stud monkey conquests at all costs. The first obstacle you'll encounter takes the form of a sniper hiding in a bush. Why would a sniper be hiding in a bush just to shoot you in the buttocks? Why not? As you approach the bush a bullet will fly out in your direction, killing you if it makes contact. To get past the sniper, simply run away a few times until he has to reload (the bullets will stop) and then run past the bush. Once you're past the bush, you can run into your lady's loving arms and explore a different kind of bush\u2026 Each time you make it to one of the women, you will start the humping mini-game. Your goal here is to meet her thrusts by pushing right every time she thrusts her pelvis. If you're successful in your timing you will score a point and a tone will sound. Each time you score a point, the tone will get higher and higher indicating that danger is approaching. If you continue to score past a certain point (around 8 or so points) your woman will appear to explode and you will fall into a pit and die (I guess you were a little too much for her). To avoid this, make sure you push the button to escape before this happens. If you manage to score 69 points you will earn an extra life.The next obstacle you must face comes in the form of a river. While conceptually this is the easiest obstacle to clear, the iffy collision detection makes it much more difficult than it should be. To clear the river, simply run towards to it and push the button when your back foot is on the edge of the bank (not your front foot). Assuming you timed it right, you will go flying over the river and meet yet another woman. You know what to do\u2026After you've scored as many points as you dare, you will be taken to the next area of the screen. Here you must run past a dangerous fire breathing dragon, which is much more difficult than it sounds. The trick to getting past the dragon is to wait for it to breathe fire, then quickly run by him. Once you're past the dragon you'll undoubtedly notice the large pit ahead of you. Here you must wait for the snake to change into a woman and then quickly drop down into the pit to do the deed. The timing on this is rather tricky as you can't simply wait around for the snake to change because the dragon is chasing you. If you manage to time it just right and find the woman, you'll be taken to the last area of the game.In this final area you must chase down the woman running around the top of the castle as they aren't just going to wait around for you anymore. As you chase your dream date, you'll notice that ugly little faces appear to be puking on you. These are actually gargoyles, and they're trying to dump lava on you. The gargoyles are easily avoided by stopping when they breathe fire, and since there are no other dangers on this level, you're free to stop and start the pursuit at will. Each time you catch the woman you can score a few points in the standard manner, but she'll run away again and the chase continues\u2026",

To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout.

Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.",

                "plot": "Kabobber is just one of those games that defies definition.  Looking a bit like a cross between Q*Bert and Frogger, Kabobber is a game as strange as its name.  Along with Thwocker, Kabobber is one of the lost Activision titles that people all knew existed somewhere, but it wasn't until 2001 that a prototype was finally confirmed to exist and the rom was released.     Kabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalogs.[CR]Since no instruction manual was ever made for Kabobber, we can only guess at what the storyline might have been.  Atari Age hosted a contest to come up with a story and manual that best fit the style of the game.  While we'll never know how close the winning entry was to the real storyline, it probably isn't too far off.  The story (such as it is) tells the tale of greedy Princess Buvsky who is attempting to devour the rainbow energy source of Kabobberland.  You must take your army of Buvskies and attempt to catch Princess Buvsky before she can reach the rainbow on the other side of the screen.  Along the way you must contend with the dangerous Kabobbers who are attempting to destroy your rescue party.[CR]The basic gameplay of Kabobber is very simple; you must hop on the enemy before he hops on you.  To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.[CR]As the boards progress the enemies become faster and more numerous, and Princess Buvsky moves towards the rainbow faster.  The game ends once all your troops are lost or Princess Buvsky reaches the energy rainbow.  On the later levels it's all about strategy, simply jumping non-stop towards the Princess won't cut it anymore.  You must carefully decide which enemies are worth conquering, and which are best left alone.  Don't take too long however, as the Princess has her eye on the prize.[CR]Kabobber is an excellent action/strategy game by Rex Bradford, the man responsible for Jedi Arena and Empire Strikes Back.   So why did Kabobber never get released?  According to Rex:[CR]\"What happened was that I \"finished\" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it.  I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted.  Anyway, I didn't feel like working on it more, and Activision didn't want to publish it as is (and was probably a little miffed at my attitude, though they never said so), and that was that.\"[CR]It's a shame Activision didn't want to release Kabobber as is, because it's a lot of fun and didn't really need anymore retooling.  Kabobber is proof that sometimes it's best to release games as is instead of reworking them to death.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/kabobber/kabobber.htm",

                "plot": "Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.[CR]Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.[CR]Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used to, but actually makes the game more challenging.[CR]While Kamikaze Saucers isn't a bad game, it's nothing special.  In the \"Me Too\" clone environment that caused the great crash, Kamikaze Saucers would hardly get noticed.  Syncro made the right decision in staying out of the crumbling market, especially with lackluster games like this.  Kamikaze Saucers is just one of many victims of bad timing.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/kamikaze/kamikaze.htm",

From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different.  Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay.  However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet...[CR]Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.  Like I said, this game is weird!.[CR]Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern.[CR]As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers.  These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation.  The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game.  The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number.  It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle.[CR]Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay.  Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke.  It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things.  Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot.  It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype.[CR]Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise.  Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat.  It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear.  Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.",

If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.[CR]Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.[CR]Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.",

There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.'

                "plot": "Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name, Looping is one of the few prototypes that was known to be 'out there', but could not be located.  Thankfully Looping finally surfaced in 2003 and was released to the gaming community.  Amazingly the 2600 version of Looping plays very close to the Colecovision original with the requisite downgrade in graphics and sound of course.  However since Looping wasn't exactly a graphical masterpiece to begin with, the downgrade isn't really all that noticeable.[CR]As the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect).  Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. [CR]Looping is separated into two main sections: The Airfield and The Pipe Maze.  Each level begins on the runway of the airfield where you must start the game by successfully taking off (just pull down on the stick).  Assuming you didn't crash into the building at the end of the runway, you're now airborne and can begin to complete your mission.  There are three possible missions depending on what level you are playing: Destroy the Terminal, Destroy the Missile, or Destroy the Terminal and Missile.  To destroy your target, you're going to have to shoot through the blocks that make up the structure, which as you may have guessed is easier said than done.  Since your plane is constantly moving at high speed you can only take a few shots at your target before passing it over (or flying into it if you're not too talented).  Also making your life miserable are several balloons which bounce around the screen at alarming speed.  Although you can shoot these balloons you end up crashing into them more often than not.  [CR]If you succeed in destroying your target it will turn gray and the gate at the far end of the Airfield will open revealing the next section of the game.[CR]The Pipe Maze (as the name suggests) is a huge maze of pipes which you must fly though in order to reach \"The End\".  The first room in this maze is fairly open, with several paths to take to the next room.  The main enemy in this room is a large green drop of ooze which constantly drips from one of the pipe opening.  This drop is fairly easy to avoid unless you take the top route which takes you right next to it (so try and take the bottom route).  The second room is very similar to the first, except it contains a \"monster\" which bounces around the top right corner.  Destroy the monster quickly and move to the final room.[CR]The final room is one of the most difficult areas of the game.  To reach \"The End\" you must maneuver past three bouncing balls that are blocking the entrances to the small inner room.  Thankfully you can shoot these balls if it looks like you're about to crash, but lining up a shot can be difficult since you're still moving at a high rate of speed.  Once you make it inside you've got one last ball to deal with before you can reach the end of the level.  After touching the finish line you will begin a new and more difficult level.[CR]It's unknown why Looping was never released since it seems to be finished and was even advertised.  One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.  Difficulty aside, Looping would have made an excellent addition to the 2600 library, and is one of the best Coleco games overall.  It appears that Coleco was finally learning after several titles of questionable quality (Donkey Kong anyone?).[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/looping/looping.htm",

You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.",

However, if the mother sees the pasta being thrown to the cat or dog, she brings three times as much pasta the next time she returns.[3][CR]The joystick is used to control the player: pressing right causes the boy to grab a plate of pasta, pressing left causes him to eat it, and pressing up or down causes him to toss the pasta to the cat (named Frankie in the manual) or the dog (named Sergio) respectively. If the cat and dog are not nearby when the food is thrown to them, the mother returns with extra pasta to \"punish\" the player. The fire button is not used.[3][CR]If, instead of eating the pasta or throwing it to the animals, the player is idle, the pasta will accumulate on the table until it breaks, causing the player to lose a turn. Attempting to eat all the pasta without giving any to the cat or dog will cause the boy's stomach to swell, changing colors from blue to yellow to red, before finally exploding in a mass of chunky blue pixels.[3]",

                "plot": "Not to be confused with the Atari game by the same name (which was released for the 7800), Meltdown was one of the final 20th Century Fox titles to be developed (Crash Dive was the absolute last) but was never released.  Why TCF decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market.  The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting \"Just Released\" had already been printed.  Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed.  Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.  [CR]Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow![CR]As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment.  [CR]The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor will be saved (for the moment).  Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily.  Once you reach the 10,000 mark, missing even one quark will likely blow the reactor.[CR]Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to put down.  It's a shame that 20th Century Fox never released Meltdown, as it is one of their better titles.  Like many TCF games, Meltdown was not developed by Fox themselves, but rather by a small company called Videa.  Videa eventually became Sente Technologies before being acquired by Bally and becoming the well known Bally Sente. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/meltdown/meltdown.htm",

                "plot": "A game based on ESP?  Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of \"Mind Reading\" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...[CR]Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the \"correct\" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast... [CR]After choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the \"correct\" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the \"Race\" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also \"pass\" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card. [CR]The current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the \"Cheat\" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/mindmaze/mindmaze.htm",

The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.[CR]The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.[CR]The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.[CR]The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.",

The player loses once all their cities are destroyed.

You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).",

A slice of old-fashioned Swiss would be nice, or, even better, a morsel of Camembert.  Mmmmm.[CR]Dreaming of cheese won't get you anywhere.  You're going to have to earn your lunch.  As a hungry but clever mouse, you'll have to chomp your way through a maze of corridors and doors, while avoiding starving cats who want nothing better than to eat you.  But those feline fanatics aren't as crafty as you are.  You can outrun them.  You can confuse them by opening and shutting trapdoors.  And, with a stash of bones in reserve, you can fool these furry menaces by turning into a cat-biting dog![CR]And the race is on!",

Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.",

Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard.

The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them. The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base",

You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt. Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors. You must stack them correctly however, or - splat! As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep your cool and try not to earn the dubious title of 'butterfingers.'",

You select what to play to choosing which character you want.For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.ScoringHitting a chicken on...Row one=10 pointsRow two=20 pointsRow three=50 pointsRow four=70 pointsRow five=100 pointsHitting Gonzo=300 pointsDestroying all the chickens=1000 point bonusIf you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.ScoringKarate-chopping a meat ball=100 pointsBoarding the Swinetrek=1000 pointsIf you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.ScoringYou get one point for every mile you get through the mine.Hitting a Gonzoid=100 pointsEscaping the mine=1000 pointsThe difficulty switches do nothing.

                "plot": "Talk about suffering from an identity crisis, for years Planet of the Ape had been misidentified as another 20th Century Fox prototype called Alligator People.  This was because the first PotA prototype was found in case labeled Alligator People, and since no screenshots of either game existed there was no reason to doubt the name on the label.  However after much research it was discovered (by yours truly) that this game was in fact really John Marvin's lost Planet of the Apes game.  So why was Planet of the Apes found in a case labeled Alligator People?  While no one knows for sure, it's assumed that this prototype was simply put into the wrong case (they probably just used an old case they had lying around).  [CR]You play the role Col. George Taylor (who looks a bit like Pitfall Harry's long lost brother).  Your mission is to guide Col. Taylor through a series of screens as he avoids an army of apes and makes his way towards the Forbidden Zone.  There are three different kinds of apes in this game, and they all move in a straight line across the screen from right to left.[CR]Chimpanzees - These little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear.  Shooting them is worth 3 points.[CR]Orangutans - Orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the Chimpanzees.  Touching them will get you captured and cost you 1 life unit.  Shooting a Chimpanzee is worth 200 points.  [CR]Gorillas - Gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes.  Not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.  Being shot will cost you 2 life units and shooting them is worth only 42 points![CR]At the top of the screen you see two counters, L and E.  L is your Life counter, you start with 60 life points and if you lose them all the game ends.  The E is your Escape counter, this is the number of times you can escape from the cage or pit.  If you run out of escapes your character will be trapped forever (effectively ending the game).[CR]The Forest[CR]You start out in a forest with several apes after you.  You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep on coming its best to run for it.  There are also pits scattered throughout the forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly.  Thankfully you can press the fire button to get out, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  While you can run in any direction, only moving south will advance you towards your goal.  Moving south three times will bring you to the river.   [CR]The River[CR]Unlike other sections of this game, the river is only one screen wide.  Once again you can move any direction, but only going south will bring you towards the Forbidden Zone.  Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move through without any trouble.  As you move through the river you'll notice that your guy appears to be flailing about with his arms in the air like he's drowning.  This may be because the river was going to be deadly and a bridge put across it, but since this is an early prototype we'll assume your guy is just a poor swimmer and move on.[CR]The Village[CR]If you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla then you'll end up here.  You can escape from the cage by pressing the fire button, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around.  It's very easy to escape and be captured again right away.  You'll also want to escape from the cage as quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while your trapped in the cage.  Moving south three times will bring you to the desert.[CR]The Desert[CR]After the river you'll encounter a large featureless desert which is the beginning of the Forbidden Zone.  There are more apes here than in any other part of the game, so you'll have to be on your guard.  Each desert board looks exactly alike except for a slight change in color, so its easy to get lost.  If you haven't been caught, moving south nine times will bring you to the caverns.  If you came by way of the village (you were captured), you only need to move south six times to reach the caves.[CR]The Caverns[CR]These have to be the funkiest looking caverns I've ever seen.  The cavern walls are rainbow colored making your journey extra trippy.  There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but they are unfortunately a giant maze.  You'll also slowly loose life points as you traverse the caves at the rate of 1 point every 5 seconds.  There are two paths out of the caves: If you got captured at least once you to move south once, left once, and south again, but if you took the long way you need to move south once, left once, and south twice to reach your goal.  If you take the wrong path through the caves you'll end up back on the forest screen.  There are other paths out of the caves, but these work every time.[CR]The Statue of Liberty[CR]This is the goal you've been trying to reach.  It's a little hard to make out, but the picture is of the Statue of Liberty's torch and head.  Once you reach this the screen will begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the background scrolls through all the boards you've crossed.  After this strange scene you'll gain 10 life points, 1 extra Escape, and 1200 bonus points.  You will now start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. [CR]Each new difficulty level has a few changes:[CR]The apes will do an extra point of damage when they shoot you.[CR]The apes move faster.[CR]More apes appear on the screen at once and come out more often.[CR]The bonus points for reaching the Statue of Liberty increases by 100.[CR]It's obvious that Planet of the Apes still has some work to be done, but was finished enough to go through initial playtesting.  Before programmer John Marvin could finish it he left 20th Century Fox to go work for Epyx.  Since 20th Century Fox closed down its video game unit three months later Planet of the Apes was never completed. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/planetoftheapes/planetoftheapes.htm",

However, the promotion never ended up seeing the light of day, and thus, the game was shelved.Despite this, a version of the game's prototype was released on the compilation disc, 'Stella Gets a New Brain' in 1996. As well as this, a standalone version of the game was released in 2002 by Cassidy Nolen during the PhillyClassic 3 game convention.",

A grey trampoline scores no points, a pink one scores five. Additionally, jumping on a pink trampoline turns it to the player's color. Players continue jumping on to trampolines, turning them their respective color, until an alarm signals the end of a stage. At this point, the next screen scrolls down vertically, and trampolines score points as they scroll off the bottom of the screen. It is therefore the object to end the stage with as many trampolines as possible turned to the respective colors of the players.[CR]Additionally, there are \"tricky trap\" trampolines (6 in total) where a player can use the lone button on the atari joystick to remove a trampoline altogether. The disappearing trampoline would be the one most recently jumped on. A magic hat is occasionally up for grabs as well. capturing the hat and touching an opponent while on a trampoline causes that opponent to temporarily freeze, giving an advantage to the player with the hat. Gold mats are worth additional points, and award one additional tricky trap for a maximum of 7.[CR]Each player has 6 lives, with a bonus life at 2000 points. The surviving player gains 200 points per remaining life (and is awarded a bonus life if the remaining life bonus puts that player over 2000).",

In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!",

                "plot": "Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.",

If you eat the steel shot, you will be an easy catch for that nasty coyote and his Acme magnet.",

Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.",

                "plot": "As 2002 was quietly winding down, an announcement was made that took the collecting community off guard.  Long time collector David Winter announced that he had discovered a previously unknown prototype, which appeared to simulate a 3-D Rubik's Cube.  Unfortunately since the prototype had no labels we can't be sure what the actual name is, but all available evidence suggests that it was simply called Rubik's Cube.  So to keep from confusing it with the Rubik's Cube cart Atari did release, we'll call this one 3-D Rubik's Cube. [CR]3-D Rubik's Cube appears to have been in development around the same time as Atari Video Cube as both have a 1982 copyright.  Why Atari would go with the bland \"one-side-at-a-time\" version when they had this amazing 3-D version is unknown, but there may have been copyright or licensing issues that forced Atari to change the look and feel of the game.  This argument is further supported by the fact that Atari renamed the game \"Atari Video Cube\" instead of keeping the name Rubik's Cube which is used in this prototype.  However the biggest mystery surrounds the re-release of Atari Video Cube as Rubik's Cube in 1984.  Obviously Atari finally secured the rights to the name, so why not release the 3-D version instead of simply recycling AVC?  Until the programmer for either game can be found, the world may never know.[CR]As you probably already guessed, 3-D Rubik's Cube is a computer simulation of the old Rubik's Cube puzzle that was all the rage back in the mid 80's.  Unlike Atari Video Cube, 3-D Rubik's Cube is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of the cube faces at once rather than one.  This makes solving the cube much easier as the player doesn't have to have a super human memory to remember the other five sides.  Since 3-D Rubik's Cube is shown in a proper 3-D perspective, players can manipulate the cube just like they would in the real world.  This is a far cry from Atari Video Cube's gameplay which involved an elf running over squares, picking up and dropping off colors (what the hell were they thinking?). [CR]3-D Rubik's Cube as two different play modes: Normal and Cheat (toggled by the left difficulty switch).  In normal mode the player can rotate the cube in any one of four directions until the desired side appears.  Once a side has been selected, the player can then rotate the individual slices (rows and columns) until they think they have it in the right position.  The player repeats this process until the cube is solved (or they go insane).  In cheat mode, the player can actually set the colors on the cube to what ever they desire.  Players can even create impossible to solve cubes by placing too much of one color or not enough of another.  Due to the strange nature of this \"cheat mode\", people have begun to speculate it may have been put in for debugging purposes.  It is unknown if it would have been included in the final release. [CR]As if this prototype wasn't amazing enough, 3-D Rubik's Cube even includes a solve mode.  If the player gets too frustrated they can choose to have the computer solve the cube for them (Yes the 2600 IS smarter than you!).  However players cannot activate the solve mode if the colors have been altered in cheat mode, so you'll have to put them back into their original configuration first.  This was done to prevent players from building unsolvable cubes with the cheat mode (there's always one kid who has to ruin it for everybody).  Unfortunately there is no way to automatically restore the colors, so it's up to the player to remember what they changed. The solve mode is actually a step-by-step demonstration (controlled by the fire button), and shows the player each move it is making.  This way players can learn what they did wrong and become better Rubik's Cube solvers (good luck beating those guys who solve them in 10 seconds flat).[CR]The graphics in 3-D Rubik's Cube are simply amazing. While they may have some rough jagged edges, each square on the cube is displayed at the proper angle to give a true 3-D perspective.  It is theorized that the cube is made up of a combination of playfield and character graphics, which allows multiple colored squares to be shown on the same scanline.  The sound effects are pretty standard for a puzzle game, consisting of a beep when rotating the cube, a little victory song upon solving the cube, and a nasty crashing sound when the solve mode fails (due to misuse of the cheat mode).  It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into this game[CR]The only problem with 3-D Rubik's Cube is that the game is just as tedious as the real world puzzle.  Why would players waste their time screwing around with a simulated puzzle (especially with the awkward controls) when they could just pick up the real thing?  Rubik's Cube 3-D is proof that just because you can digitize something doesn't necessarily mean you should.. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/3drubikscube/3drubikscube.htm",

Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.[CR]On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.[CR]In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.[CR]In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.",

Sometimes radioactive waste would float through the level and the player would have to get rid of it by shooting it.  The player must shoot the projectiles and waste without letting them hit their submarine because the player will lose a life.  The game also included difficulty switches which would change the speed of the projectiles and whether the projectiles were larger, slower, easier to shoot nets or smaller, faster harpoons.

Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.[CR]Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen.

Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game.

                "plot": "Talk about a game with convoluted history!  It was once thought that Spinning Fireball (along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief), were all unreleased games developed by a company called Zimag which may have also been known as Emag or Vidco.  However after some intense research it was discovered that these games may have been developed in Taiwan and simply patched into NTSC format.  [CR]Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.  [CR]The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level.  [CR]While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four). [CR]While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/firespinner/firespinner.htm",

                "plot": "Star Wars is an arcade game produced by Atari Inc. and released in 1983.[2] The game is a first person space simulator, simulating the attack on the Death Star from the 1977 film Star Wars. The game is composed of 3D color vector graphics. This game was developed during the Golden Age of Arcade Games and is considered the #4 most popular game of all time according to the readers of Killer List of Videogames.[3][CR]The player assumes the role of Luke Skywalker (\"Red Five\"), as he pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. Unlike other arcade games of similar nature, the player does not have to destroy every enemy in order to advance through the game; he must simply survive as his fighter flies through the level, which most often means he must avoid or destroy the shots that enemies fire. Each hit on his craft takes away one shield (of the six he started out with), and if he runs out of shields and takes another hit, the game ends.[CR]The player's ultimate goal is to destroy the Death Star through three attack phases.[CR]In the first phase of the game, the player begins in outer space above the Death Star. He must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters.[CR]In the second phase, the player reaches the Death Star's surface as laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. The player is awarded a bonus if they manage to destroy a certain number of turrets.[CR]In the final scenario, the player must navigate the trench of the Death Star, avoiding obstacles and gun turrets until finally firing a proton torpedo at the correct time for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield up to a maximum of 6. Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, they are awarded a bonus for \"using the Force.\"[CR]The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases the difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in the second round, and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, in order to give the player a chance to destroy the fired shots.[2]",

The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!",

Then, the battle begins. Your laser cannons blast away at attacking enemy starfighters. But wait! Damage reports show enemy fire has destroyed your defensive shields. Quickly but carefully, you maneuver back through the galaxy to dock at your starbase for repairs. And, undaunted, you return to complete your mission.",

                "plot": "Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first \"Non-Pong\" standalone consoles, and was based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making your \"Stunt Cycle\" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the top of the screen, where you are given two \"rows\" of screen space to build up speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The \"trick\" to the game is to build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again.[CR]Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a perfect port of the standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics were in Black and White (which was standard at the time).  Since Atari 2600 games had to have the option of color or B&W, some color was added to the game (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt Cycle was finished and ready to go.[CR]It was around this time that marketing had \"brilliant\" idea; why not make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  Some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. [CR]So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved, programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch (which was never released either). [CR]Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up to another act of Atari mismanagement.[CR]Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never assigned a product number.

The stages then repeat in this order two more times with the later stages increasing the challenge by adding more enemies.

The ping of the sonar fills the night.

In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls.

It is similar in concept to its predecessor, but much more difficult.[CR]The game was a success, selling 12,337 video game arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern's third best-selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the US in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 US cabinet sales for both.[1][CR]Super Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there was an Adventure Vision handheld version from Entex.[CR]The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits.[CR]The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFO's while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.[2][CR]The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.[2][CR]The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows,[2][CR]Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.[CR]Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.[CR]Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.[CR]Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.[CR]Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.[CR]Firing rockets in a building maze.[CR]Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.[CR]There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.",

The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. [CR]Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked off to the first screen.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/telepathy/telepathy.htm",

                "plot": "On the list of games that should never have been tried on the 2600, Tempest has to be near the top.  Why Atari decided they could reproduce a 3D vector game on the 2600 is beyond me, but the results were disastrous.  Thankfully Atari killed off this experiment gone wrong before it could hurt anybody.[CR]I've said it once and I'll say it again; If there's one thing the 2600 doesn't do it's diagonals.  Unfortunately Tempest is chockfull of diagonals as the tubes angle out from the center of the screen to form complex geometric patterns.  This leads us to the next problem, if there's a second thing the 2600 doesn't do it's complex geometric patterns!  The 2600 version gets around this by not having 3D tubes, but rather a flat looking shape with the enemies coming from one side and the player moving on the other.  For some reason the \"shape\" seems to flux and change a bit as things move around the screen, this is probably the result of a programming glitch.  The \"shape\" is segmented into what could be called tubes (if you use your imagination), but these \"tubes\" don't seem to correspond to where the real tubes (which are invisible) are. [CR]This brings us to the next problem, if there's a third thing the 2600 doesn't do it's 3D perspective.  Atari couldn't get around this one; the 3D perspective is what makes Tempest \"Tempest\".  Atari tried to simulate this by changing the enemy's size to make it look like it was getting closer.  Unfortunately there aren't nearly enough frames of animation to do this, so the enemies sort of jump forward in an awkward fashion.  The enemy graphics are very blocky and becomes even more evident as the size is increased when they approach the outer edge of the tube.  This combined with a very blocky looking \"shape\" for the board makes for one nasty looking game.[CR]In the programmers defense, they did a wonderful job on Tempest considering they were asked to do the impossible.  Since this version isn't complete, it's really not fair to start judging it yet.  Given some time, I'm sure a much more playable version with improved graphics and smother gameplay could have been put together.  While it probably wouldn't have ever looked like its arcade counterpart, this prototype proves that Tempest could (in a very limited fashion) be done on the 2600.  A later version with some added features like a title screen was reviewed in Ultimate Gamer magazine, but it's unknown what happened to that prototype.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/tempest/tempest.htm",

                "plot": "Thwocker was one of the long lost Activision prototypes that finally surfaced in 2001 when it was found a thrift shop along with some other prototypes.  Like most other unreleased Activision games, Thwocker was never mentioned in any catalogs or announced at any gaming expos.  Apparently Activision liked to keep their games secret until they were sure it was going to be released.  Not a bad policy.[CR]Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor fame), Thwocker was described as \"Joust with musical instruments\".  While this isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the maze to start the song.[CR]Once the song starts to play your character will be able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the exit square.[CR]The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire button, which will make the conductor sort of \"skip\" across the level.  You will need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the level.[CR]Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow \"combine\" the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable after all. [CR]Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in between 9 and 10.  [CR]Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.[CR]These game numbers are represented by a space, another space, a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16 games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be 16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the conclusion that they were indeed planned.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/thwocker/thwocker.htm",

It is known as Hyper Olympic in Japan.It has been ported to over nine different platforms including the NES, as well as Xbox Live Arcade, since its original release.Track & Field introduced a button-mashing style of gameplay in which the player must press a button as fast as possible, and their in-game character interacts with the environment accordingly. This style of gameplay is still used today by many popular titles. The arcade release accommodated up to four players at once. The NES version (arguably the most popular) was designed for only two players. Track & Field has received graphical and sound updates, leaderboards, online play, and additional events since its initial release in 1983. The Atari 2600 version included a specialized controller, mimicking the arcade input.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Long JumpIn the arcade version of Track & Field, players had two \"run\" buttons and one \"action\" button. The run buttons were used to increase the speed of the character on-screen, while the action button was used to do things like initiate a jump or adjust the angle of a javelin throw. The NES version (possibly due to hardware limitations) had only one run button.100 Meter Dash110 Meter HurdlesHammer ThrowHigh JumpJavelin ThrowLong JumpIn each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) ends the game. Events that were later added to Track & Field after the arcade release include: 100-meter freestyle, skeet shooting, vault, archery, triple jump, weight lifting, and pole vault.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade[CR]A slightly enhanced version of Track & Field was released for XBLA in 2007. It includes full Xbox Live support (ranked and player matches) and in-depth leaderboards.[CR]The Track & Field Legacy[CR]Archery was added after the original arcade release.Over the years, Konami released several games featuring gameplay from the same vein as the original:Konami '88 (1988) (Arcade)Track & Field II (1988) (NES)Track & Field (1992) (Game Boy)International Track & Field (1996) (PS)Hyper Athlete (1996) (Arcade)Nagano Winter Olympics '98 (1998) (N64, PS)International Track & Field 2000 (1999) (N64, PS, GBC)ESPN International Track & Field (2000) (DC, PS2, GBC)Track and Field (2007) (Xbox Live Arcade)New International Track & Field (2008) (NDS)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The 1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track & Field Challenge was the largest video game tournament in history, with over a million contestants, including 800,000 in the US and 200,000 in Japan.

The faster you jog, the faster the jogger figure moves around the track. Lap count, time and score are displayed on the bottom of the screen. Once around the track is equal to approximately thirty-five yards. [CR]To add variety and greater challenge to JOGGER, you may at any time, switch the jogger figure to the lower, faster track by stepping on the RED dot of the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD, and back again to the upper, slower track by stepping on the YELLOW dot. [CR]JOGGER is more effective at the slower pace. The length of time jogging is more beneficial to your fitness than moving at sprint speed. [CR]Track laps are counted, giving JOGGER a competitive feature for increased family pleasure. After 2,000 points are accumulated, the pace syrnbol speed increases and challenges you to jog faster. [CR]Five minutes into your run, a second pace symbol appears on each track, making JOGGER even more spirited among participants. [CR]Bonus points may be earned by passing the pace symbol when it is GREEN. If you pass when it is RED, you lose a \"life.\" JOGGER gives you three \"lives\" before the sequence needs to be repeated. There are four levels of difficulty. [CR]When you exercise on JOGGER, it is beneficial to remember that you are running in place. Maintain an erect posture and you will get more out of your workout. Make certain that you jog on the BLUE and ORANGE dots. [CR]JOGGER is an excellent trainer for those who want to begin a jogging program, or trim off pounds.",

When you see a \"bug\" appear on one of the colored squares, you have a limited [CR]time (one to three seconds, depending on the level) to step on the corresponding colored dot of the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD. To train your reflexes further, a \"bug\" can appear on more than one colored square at the same time. You get a point for each correct hit. The level of difficulty increases every twenty points. There are eight \"lives\" per program. A life is lost each time you step on the wrong color or delay too long in hitting the dot. You should not Step on a colored square when a BUTTERFLY appears, If do, it takes one of your \"lives:' REFLEX is the ideal trainer for those participating in aerobics, jazzercise, tennis, soccer, football, track and field, and snow and water skiing.",

To do this, you will first need to unlock the secret passage by bringing a fire, water and air crystal back to your cave. Crystals can be found by exploring the various locations available, usually you will need to destroy one of the many enemies so they turn into a crystal. Fire and water crystals can not be in the cave alone at the same time, an air crystal must be placed between them; so you will need to bring back the crystals in the order fire, air, water or water, air, fire. Once you've done this a super crystal is formed unlocking the secret passage so you can try to get the diamond! Your dragon has a limited amount of energy; being hit by enemies will cause the energy to deplete, and the game ends when all of your dragons have lost all their energy.",

This game was released in 1983.[CR]This game has nothing to do with the similarly named Marvel's comic book series entitled X-Men. It is the only title made by Universal Gamex. It had faced protest from women\u2019s groups when it was first released, and most retailers declined to carry it - or if they did, buyers had to be 18 years old to purchase the game, or it was kept under-the-counter. It could also be purchased via mail order, and an ad inviting such purchases appeared in at least one gaming magazine a full-page ad can be found in the July 1983 issue of Videogaming Illustrated. Consequently, as of 2014, it is very hard to find. However, it is easier to find this game in PAL format and rarer in NTSC.[CR]There have been reports that there are between twenty and forty-five cartridges in existence.",

You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.",
