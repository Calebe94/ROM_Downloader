This list is filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR][CR]The Philips CD-i (Compact Disc Interactive) is an interactive multimedia CD player developed and marketed by Royal Philips Electronics.[CR]This category of device was created to provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but at a lower price than a personal computer with CD-ROM drive at the time. The cost savings were due to the lack of a hard drive, floppy drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor (a standard television was used), and less operating system software. In addition to games, educational and multimedia reference titles were produced, such as interactive encyclopedias, museum tours, etc. before public Internet access was widespread. Competitors included the Tandy VIS and Commodore CDTV. CD-i also refers to the multimedia Compact Disc standard used by the CD-i console, also known as Green Book, which was developed by Philips and Sony. Work on the CD-i began in 1984 and it was first publicly announced in 1986.[CR]Manufacturer: Philips[CR]CPU: Philips SCC68070[CR]Memory: 1 MB of main RAM[CR]Graphics: SCC66470, later MCD 212[CR]Sound: MCD 221 16-bit stereo sound[CR]Display: 384x280 to 768x560[CR]Media: Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  1",

He enters his response secretly, and another player (the \"challenger\") tries to predict what it was. Situations are drawn from the categories Love, Career, Money, and Family. Correct guesses earn points, but there's an element of bluffing, too. The game is aimed at adults and teenagers.",

There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical.

From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.[CR]The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.[CR]The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.",

In the single player version your goal is to catch as many flies floating about the top of the screen within the time allowed and to beat the AI's frogs score. In the 2-player version, you do the same but go head-2-head against another player which makes snagging those flies at the last minute, just before your competitor does, a real treat.",

For part II the games are:[CR]1. Blockbuster, a remake of Arkanoid.[CR]2. Bughunt, a remake of Centipede[CR]Both games have modernized graphics over the original, while the gameplay stays mostly the same. In Blockbuster the player moves a paddle left and right to bounce a ball against blocks at the top of the screen. Blocks are destroyed when hit by the ball and in order to win all blocks have to be destroyed. Some blocks contain powerups that make it easier for the player. [CR]In Bughunt the player tries to kill centipedes by shooting it from the bottom of the screen. Whenever shot the centipedes lose parts of their body, making them harder to hit for a successive hit.",

[CR]Mario and Luigi must stop him and rescue the princess by closing doors in the hotels.[CR]Most hotel stages have 10 levels, other stages have less, others more. You close doors by pressing button 2. Enemies will come through some doors and will try to open doors to prevent you from succeeding. You can jump on some enemies by pressing button 1.[CR]Behind some doors, you will find a mushroom that will allow you to take a hit without dying. If you already got a mushroom, you will find a fire flower that will allow you to shoot fireballs by pressing buttons 1 & 2 simultaneously. This will take out some enemies easier and other enemies can only be defeated with the fireball.[CR]When you reach the top level of your current hotel, you will need to close the doors here while avoiding one of the Koopalings. Once you succeed, there will be an animated FMV cutscene then it is off to the next hotel (stage).[CR]All the stages are plays on real hotels, like Morton's WoodDoor-Hysteria Hotel, Roy's HardBrick Hotel, Lemmy's High-ate Regency Hotel, Bowser's Seizures Palace Hotel, etc.",

                "plot": "Laser Lords is a comedic adventure game that takes place in space.[CR]In the game the player takes on the role of a human hitchhiker who is abducted from a desert road by a space ship. The plot will unfold to have the player save the universe. An evil and ancient being called Sarpedon is trying to obtain a certain crystal that will allow him to possess the entire universe. Needless to say the player has to prevent this from happening. The game requires you to explore seven planets, each of which has settings that resemble our own mythology and history such as the planet Argos that looks much like ancient Greece. Each world is full of references to historic events and stories.[CR]The game combines adventure game elements with platform game elements. The player has 9 lives. When you run out the game is over, but you can save and load the game to prevent from having to start the game over completely. You can collect and trade items to solve puzzles. When talking to NPCs highlighted words in their dialogue can be remembered. This places them in your \"word bank\" and allows you to ask other NPCs about those subjects. All the NPCs are fully voiced. Actors often impersonated famous voices like those of Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Wayne and Gregory Peck.[CR]In spite of its \"Ages 12 and up\" rating, the game is filled with dark humor, sex, drugs, homosexuality and gambling references. It is even possible to play Russian Roulette in the game.",

It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.[CR]These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.[CR]Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.[CR]The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.",

Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.[CR]The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.[CR]The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.",

If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over. Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.[CR]Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms. It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.[CR]This CD-i version of the game features slightly different graphics, video nature scenes at the background while you play and a relaxing soundtrack  by Jim Andron. The game play stays exactly identical to the classic.",

In order to make your life in the aquatic levels easier, the wizard will turn you into a frog. In order to fly, you're equipped with a special flying helmet. Each level has a new weapon for you to use, ranging from the traditional magic wand to a rubber ball, a water pistol or even a laser gun. As in any normal platform game, each level has an end-boss, and between levels are bonus rounds.",

Of course it's not easy to navigate around an airport.Tim & Beer op het Vliegveld is an interactive cartoon film in which the viewer watches Tim & Beer explore the airport and the airplane. Viewers can opt to let the cartoon roll, or at times interfere and tell Tim or Bear what to do by choosing from several preset options.

Her father, the king, went to the land of Gamelon to help Duke Onkled in his battle against the evil Ganon. A month has passed, but there is no news from the king. The brave hero Link decides to find him but then disappears. The young princess travels to Gamelon by herself to find and to free both her father and Link...[CR]Unlike classic Zelda games, \"Wand of Gamelon\" is viewed from a platform perspective. In the beginning you are given a map with several accessible locations. Once you choose a location, you enter a platform level where you must fight enemies in real-time combat, as well as meet people who will send you on quests. At any time there are several locations accessible, and many quests can be completed in a non-linear fashion.",
