It was originally released in Japan in 1988 as Mega Drive, then in North America in 1989 as Sega Genesis, and in Europe, Australia and other PAL regions in 1990 as Mega Drive. The reason for the two names is that Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in North America. The Sega Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Sega Master System with which it has backward compatibility. The controversy over games like Mortal Kombat in the United States forced Sega to create the first content rating system for video games, the Videogame Rating Council, rather than have the games heavily censored. The rating system allowed Sega to ship games with little to no censorship and gave it a competive edge when the same game was released by Nintendo. The success of those games eventually forced Nintendo to join its rating system.[CR]Developer:  Sega[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]CPU:  Motorola 68000[CR]Memory:  64K work RAM (68000), 64K video RAM, 8K work RAM (Z80)[CR]Graphics:  Yamaha YM7101[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2612 5 channel FM and 1 channel FM/PCM, Texas Instruments SN76489 4 channel PSG (Programmable Sound Generator)[CR]Display:  320x448[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling \"slots\" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.",

From these vantage points, the player can progress in the stage or find hidden bonuses.[CR]3 Ninjas Kick Back is based on the 1994 movie of the same name, which was the second 3 Ninjas movie to be released. The plot concerns the theft of a dagger that was awarded to the trio's grandfather, Mori, for winning a tournament in Japan 50 years ago. The trio eventually head to Japan to track it down, fighting the goons of Koga (an embittered runner-up in the tournament) along the way.[CR]The Sega CD version of the game was bundled together with the 1992 SNES/Genesis licensed platformer Hook, which was also based on a family movie distributed by TriStar Pictures.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] View Credits[CR]After loosing all lives, and not continuing, you will briefly be shown a Game Over screen.

To do this you must set up the screen in a certain way. Have one row of the normal jewels stacked up almost to the top of the playfield. There must be vertical space for only two of the three jewels in the next block to come on the screen. Watch the \"Next Block\" preview box.

The SNES version is a traditional side-scrolling action game whereas the Genesis version is a two player game that plays like a shooter. But instead of using guns, Batman and Robin uses Batarangs and other projectiles to take out their foes. The Sega CD version consists of just Batmobile levels.[CR]The SNES Version[CR]The Adventures of Batman & Robin was originally titled \"Batman: The Animated Series\" after the show. But since the show got a name change, the game was delayed and then renamed to what it is called today and Robin was added as an NPC. Despite his appearance in the game, Robin is not a playable character. Each level is based off episodes of the series and shared dialogue and moments from them. Before each level Batman must choose from a variety of different weapons to take with him.[CR]The SNES version had 8 levels:Level 1: Amused to Death[CR]The Joker and Harley Quinn broadcast a television message to Batman inviting him to meet them at The Joker's Funhouse.[CR]Boss: The Joker[CR]Based on the episode(s): Christmas with the Joker, Be A ClownLevel title cardLevel 2: No Green Peace[CR]Bizarre things are occurring at the forest in Gotham City suburban district there's only one person who would do such a thing.

Instead of using guns Batman and Robin use Batarangs. Levels are swarming with enemies and the player must \"shoot\" them to defeat them. If they get up close to the player then the heroes will either punch or kick them instead of throwing a Batarang. In some levels the player flies in a Batwing moving from the left to the right shooting down anything in their path. The plot features Mr. Freeze wanting to freeze Gotham . In the process he releases Joker, Two-Face, and Mad Hatter out of Arkham Asylum an attempt to distract Batman and Robin from his intentions. The Genesis version consists of four levels:Happy Birthday to Me!Bosses:Harley's RobotHarley QuinnJokerA Two-Sided StoryBosses:Two Face's AirshipLarge ShipTwo-FaceTea Time!Bosses:Giant CatGiant DollMad-HatterSnow in July?Boss:Mr. Freeze[CR]The Sega CD Version[CR]Pimp my ride![CR]The Sega CD version is a 3D driving game with levels comprising only of driving the Batmobile and Batplane from point A to point B - shooting enemy vehicles along the way. The CD version is well known for having over 16 minutes of original animated footage created purely for the game with no involvement from Warner Bros. Animation. These cutscenes would later be known as 'The Lost Episode' from the animated series. All the principal voice actors from the series like Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Loren Lester, Arleen Sorkin and John Glover reprise their roles. The only thing missing from the source material is the original score by Danny Elfman and Shirley Walker. The game instead used its own \"synth rock\" style music.Enemies:Poison IvyThe RiddlerHarley QuinnThe JokerRupert ThorneClayface[CR]",

In the game, the duo chase after some familiar-looking thieves who rob the Rocky and Bullwinkle Museum on its opening day. The player can also play basic mini-games featuring Dudley Do-Right, the fearless (and hapless) Canadian Mountie, and Sherman and Mister Peabody, a boy and his dog who regularly travel through time.[CR]The game was developed by Imagineering Inc. released on multiple systems by THQ. The NES and Game Boy versions were created first in late 1992, followed by the SNES and Genesis versions in mid-1993. The characters in the SNES version actually break the fourth wall to remark on the earlier versions and the similar material, displaying the same wry self-referential humor of the series it's based on.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review score of 4 out of 10 writing, \"...This is an almost carbon-copy of the NES version, with the poor control intact! Dig the way Rocky attacks with those huge antlers and climbs the side of that mountain! The variety of games is nice, but the whole thing looks rushed\".[CR]",

The story involves Ektor narrowly surviving his climactic battle with Aero in the previous game, getting saved by his henchman Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, while Aero accidentally falls into a magician's box and is teleported to an unknown location.[CR]As with the previous game, the platforming is built around Aero's ability to \"drill\" through the air. This works as both a means to attack enemies and as a double jump to get around obstacles, though the distance and direction is fixed: Aero can only fly at a 60 degree angle up or down (dependent on whether or not the player is holding down on the D-pad). Levels also have a number of secret areas and power-ups to find, often behind fake walls. Aero the Acro-Bat 2 also includes snowboarding levels.[CR]The credits of Aero the Acro-Bat 2 features a dedication to Ayrton Senna, the Formula One racer who passed away in the May of 1994.[CR]",

The cockpit was built on hydraulics, which simulated flight by moving the player roughly 25 degrees in both a horizontal and vertical axis, in a rough representation of the fighter's in-game movement. As the cockpit was enclosed on almost all sides, spectators who stood too close to the moving cockpit could be injured, so large screens (simulcasting the gameplay) were frequently mounted above the cabinet. This deluxe version often cost upward of $1.00USD for a single credit.[CR]Stereo speakers were placed at the ear level for the deluxe cabinet version, creating a very immersive (and sometimes deafening) play experience. The arcade controls consisted of a flight stick with multiple buttons and a throttle stick which could be used to slow down the aircraft or activate it's afterburners. The addition of the throttle was the most notable change from the original After Burner.[CR]There 23 stages in the game: Stages 5, 13 and 23 are non-playable landing cutscenes and levels 8 and 17 are canyon bombing runs. The remaining stages involve air to air combat using an unlimited cannon, and a limited supply of missiles. The missile supply is restored approximately every 2-3 levels in a non-playable air-air refuelling sequence, as well as in the first two landing cutscenes. Cameo's from the vehicles in Hang-On, and Out Run, make appearances during the first two landing cutscenes, driving down the runway in front of the F-14 as it is taking off.[CR]Points were rewarded for both distance traveled and enemies destroyed. For unknown reasons, the designers decided to reward players with literally millions of points for performing any sort of action in the game, making the high score table sometimes showing players with scores in the billions.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]To get extra missiles, press the following while refueling:",

Every level ends with a boss and some section speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any points as long as there are lives and credits left. The game can be played with two players cooperatively.",

After choosing one from the different locations on the map, the player is shown flying from a first-person cockpit perspective and enemies do not seem to have trouble locating the player's aircraft. In different solo missions the player needs to take out all opposition using regular bullets and lock-on missiles. All statistics, including the remaining time before running out of fuel and the enemies on the radar, are shown in the cockpit HUD. The craft is able to move left and right, and use a boost to do sideways rolls or complete loops to get behind enemies. Some shots can be taken, leading to body damage, but incoming missiles are usually fatal and those need to be shot or avoided. Next to regular enemies, there are also a few boss planes. Missions take place all over the world during different times of day.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]When selecting a mission move the cursor to an area off the map and hold start and press A, B, C, B, A, A, B, C, B, A, B and then let go of start when done and you will hear a noise meaning you have done the code correctly.

In response to this malfunction, SULACO's \"brain\" ejects the EEV containing the cryotubes. We later find out that not only has the synthetic human, Bishop been aboard as well, but an alien has also managed to infest itself within the body of Ripley.[CR]As the SULACO plummets helplessly through space, the EEV is hurled out of its hold and crashes on an isolated section of the mining planet and \"penal colony,\" FIORINA 161. This is a place so dark, so dreary, so deep in space that it has all but been forgotten by civilization, and salvation for its inhabitants seems hopeless.[CR]Upon impact, the EEV is seriously damaged and the cryotubes holding Newt and Hicks are shattered, leaving them dead. Bishop, the android, is shattered and reduced to negative capability, while Ripley is left unconscious, but alive.[CR]The planet FIORINA 161 is inhabited by hard-core individuals who are convicts serving time in this maximum security facility. These outcasts were left on the planet as a maintenance crew. They are joined in this \"other-worldly existence\" by a medical officer and two supervisors. The men are thieves, rapists, murderers... the worst of the worst, and they have been able to resist any sort of temptation for many years. That includes the temptation of a woman. A woman such as Ripley.[CR]Clemens, the medical officer, is able to rescue Ripley and \"bring her back to life.\" Suspecting that the aliens have followed her to FIORINA 161, Ripley attempts to prove her worst fears are true. She knows that \"The Company,\" the private corporation that financed her many space explorations, considers the Aliens to be an important species and has ordered them not to be harmed. The \"Company\" has millions of dollars invested in the \"Alien Retrieval Project\" which would bring this strain of hideous killing machines back to earth to be used for world domination. Ripley is aware of their devious plan and knows that they must be stopped.[CR]Ripley's worst fears have now become true. She has indeed brought the aliens to FIORINA 161 and they are now growing in number and will eventually find a way to leave this barren planet and make their way to a more populated... more civilized world. Earth.[CR]Ripley now takes on her most important assignment. She must rescue the alien's captives, and then find and destroy the aliens themselves.[CR]That thump... is your heartbeat... as you get set to confront the Aliens.[CR]--From the Genesis Alien 3 instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]You are Ellen Ripley (of course), sole survivor of another space ship crash (of course), and your mission is to rescue prisoners (of course) from the Aliens (of course) which you brought with you onto their unfortunate planet (of course).[CR]Alien 3 is a fun sci-fi shoot-em-up game, as could be expected from the title. The graphics are pretty nice, the Aliens are particularly well animated, but the sound effects could use improvement. Pretty generic guns and bombs.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Armed with a sweet arsenal of guns and bombs, slug your way through each level, blowing away the nasty bug monster things, and rescuing the poor unfortunate souls who got pasted to the wall with Alien goo, before they burst open with new Alien bug monsters.[CR]Lots of choices for weapons make for a nice variety in your game-play. You have a rifle, grenade launcher, hand grenades, and flamethrower, each with its own ammo supply which you have to renew. There are also med packs to restore your health, you'll need that quite a lot, and one supremely useless feature, which is a battery pack for your radar or whatever. It tells you when aliens or prisoners are nearby, but by the time it lights up you can usually see them onscreen.[CR]Unfortunately, there is some monotony and not much replay value, due to the fact that every mission is the same: rescue all the prisoners before time runs out. Still it's fun to watch and hear the splattering of Alien guts all over the place while searching for their human would-be victims. Every few levels you get a boss instead, but he's just a bigger and tougher Alien with somewhat different attack modes.[CR]Overall Alien 3 is a fun game to try for a while, if you get bored you can stop at any time and no one will think the worse of you. Also try the SNES Version of Alien 3, it has some different features, particularly a better variety of mission styles.

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Alien Storm is a side-scrolling brawler for up to three players in the Arcade version, two players in the Genesis version, and one in the Master System version. Players take control of one of the three members of the 'Alien Busters' over six stages, each containing multiple levels and boss battles.[CR]Players fight multiple types of aliens in the game, each move and attack differently, some using the environment to attack or hide from danger. Killing some aliens will drop power-ups, giving the player either extra lives, energy or health.[CR]Each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, e.g. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon and a special attacks which differ greatly depending on the game's version. [CR]Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). [CR]Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). [CR]Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. [CR]A large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low. [CR]At the end of each mission is a bonus stage, where the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, or an auto-scrolling running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but features ranged weapons. [CR]Platform Variation[CR]Special attacks (mentioned above)Number of simultaneous players (mentioned above)Karen is absent in the Master System version of the game.Gordon is named Garth in some versionsScooter the robot, is named \"Slammer\" in Master System version.The Genesis and Mega Drive version has 8 stages instead of 6.In the console and Japanese arcade versions, Gordon has red clothes while Karen has a yellow outfit. In the US arcade version, Gordon is dressed in blue and Karen is in red. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms.

He can perform a standard punch, a ducking punch, a jumping punch, a shin kick, a vertical kick, or a jumping kick. If he kills a white wolf enemy and grabs the flying orbs they leave behind, Zeus yells \" Power Up!\" and the centurion grows much more muscular, with more powerful punches and kicks. After collecting three orbs, he transforms into one of the following creatures:Level 1 - Wolf: The wolf's punches shoot out fireballs and his kick attack is replaced with a horizontal dash that quickly moves across the screen, killing any enemy in its path.Level 2 - Dragon: The dragon can fly across the screen. His punch is replaced with a lightning bolt that shoots out of the dragon's mouth. His kick is replaced with a radial lightning storm that kills any nearby enemies.Level 3 - Bear: The bear's punch attack is a short-ranged breath attack that turns enemies into stone, which can then be smashed. For his kick attack, the bear becomes an invincible spinning ball that flies straight up, or can be moved in an arc.Level 4 - Tiger: The tiger shoots a fireball from his fists when punching, just like the wolf. His kick is an up-and-down invincible dash.Level 5 - Golden Wolf: The golden wolf has the same moves as the wolf.[CR]Each level scrolls automatically to the right, with enemies advancing on the centurion throughout the level. The centurion can take several hits before he is killed. At the end of each level, the centurion faces off with the evil boss Neff, who transforms into a hideous monster capable of withstanding many attacks.

Although they share some similarities, the two games are quite different. The SNES version of the game allows for the player to switch between the three characters, Yakko, Wakko and Dot, at will. There are no actual \"lives\" in this game: the game ends when every character is captured. Also, the characters move left, right, up and down, similar to the Final Fight series of games but dissimilar to many other platformer games. The game's goal is to retrieve the lost pages of a script stolen by Pinky and The Brain, in order to stop their attempt to \"try and take over the world\". Each level has many references to and parodies of different films, such as Indiana Jones.[CR]The Genesis version is different from the SNES version and shares more similarities to a normal platformer game. This game has some elements of The Lost Vikings games, in that each character has a special trait that must be used to overcome obstacles in each level: for example, Yakko can push heavy objects, Wakko can use his hammer to break blocks, and Dot can use her charm (\"air kiss\") to stop male characters obstructing the level. Each level is a parody of a different movie genre and can be played out of order (non-linear, much like the Mega Man series). The goal of the game is to retrieve stolen artifacts from movies so as to, yet again, stop Pinky and the Brain from taking over the Warner Brothers studio and the world.[CR]Both games are also tongue-in-cheek in nature, often having various references to popular films and even fourth wall moments. Specifically, the beginning cutscene of the Animaniacs game for Genesis has the characters talking about themselves being in a video game (and \"welcoming\" the player to the game).[CR]",

It was originally known as Ozaki Naomichi no Super Masters in Japan, but switched names (and celebrity pro-golfer endorser) when crossing to the US and Europe.[CR]Like a handful of golfing sims in the 16-bit era, the game projects a flat 3D plane of the course that the player can use to determine the direction of their next shot. The game has three courses for the player to choose from: a Japanese course, a USA course and a UK course.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf lets the player pick from two game modes: Tournament, and Practice.[CR]Tournament mode is comprised of 12 rounds of golf, each containing 18 unique holes. The player may select from three courses/locations: United States, Great Britain, and Japan. By progressing through Tournament mode, the player will develop better skills, allowing him or her to hit the ball harder and with greater precision, and also provides the player the use of new, better golf clubs. While the game possesses no save option, it does provide a code that can be used in order to start over at a particular round.[CR]Practice mode gives players a chance to hone their golf skills and allows them access to all skill levels and golf clubs.[CR]In play, the golfer's caddy provides useful information based on the player's skill level. At the lowest levels, the caddy will only be able to show the distance from the ball to the tee. However, as the player progresses through the rounds, the caddy can give more situational advice.[CR]The game utilizes a traditional control scheme, requiring the player to stop a moving meter at given points in order to determine height and strength of a shot. Upon reaching the green, the view switches to a closeup of the ball's position, and provides the player with a simple map of the green for easier shot making.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Name codes[CR]Enter the name:",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Art of Fighting (known in Japan as Ryuuko no Ken) is a fighting game developed and published by  SNK for the  Neo Geo. Although overshadowed by  Street Fighter II, released a year earlier, Art of Fighting innovated the fighting game genre through its use of large character sprites (with battle damage), camera zooming, taunting, super and \"desperation\" moves, and a \"spirit gauge\" that depletes when certain moves are used.[CR]The game takes place in the late seventies in the fictional city of South Town, where  Ryo Sakazaki and  Robert Garcia must find out the whereabouts of Ryo's kidnapped sister,  Yuri. The game is set decades before the events of  Fatal Fury. SNK would regularly find ways to integrate characters from this game into Fatal Fury and vice versa before eventually creating The King of Fighters series, which pits characters from both Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting against each other irrespective of continuity.[CR]The game was originally released in the Arcades and on the Neo Geo and Neo Geo CD. It was soon ported to the Super Nintendo, Genesis/Mega Drive and Turbo-CD platforms. Since then, it's been rereleased in the Art of Fighting Anthology for PlayStation 2 in 2006, on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and on the PSN store in 2011. Each of the rereleases are based on the Neo Geo home version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like traditional fighting games. The player has two basic attack buttons: punch and kick. The third button is a \"utility\" button which can allow the player to do stronger punches and kicks (when combined with the punch or kick buttons), throws, and walljumps. The fourth button is a taunting button. Not every character can perform throws and walljumps. This game also features dashing forwards and backwards by pressing the joystick in either direction twice. Fireballs can be canceled out using punches or kicks.[CR]The game also features a \"spirit gauge\", which controls when the player can perform special and super moves. The gauge lowers after the player performs a special/super move. The more powerful the move, the more the gauge depletes. The gauge also depletes when the opponent performs a taunt. The gauge can only be recharged manually by holding down either the punch or kick button. It will be in one of three colors (green, yellow, or red) depending on the amount left.[CR]Only Ryo and Robert have super (the Haou Shou Ken) and \"desperation\" (Ryuko Ranbou) moves that can only be learned through a special bonus stage. Both moves take up much of the spirit gauge, but the desperation move can only be performed when the player has 20% life or less (as indicated by a flashing life bar).[CR]In single-player Story mode, the player is usually at a disadvantage with shorter life and spirit gauges. These can be increased in special bonus stages, where the player must perform a certain task (careful button pressing or button mashing).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Ryo Sakazaki (playable in one-player story mode) Robert Garcia (playable in one-player story mode) Ryuhaku Todoh Jack Turner Lee Pai Long King Mickey Rogers John Crawley Mr. Big (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code) Mr. Karate (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code)[CR]",

                "plot": "Way back in history, I mean way back, before microwaves and MTV (man! how did they live?) there lived two good friends, Asterix and Obelix. These two lived in Gaul (which is northern France, before France became a bunch of scaredy babies), and the bad guys at the time were the Romans (a bunch of people with little swords and dresses). Well, these Romans kidnapped the druid of Asterix's village and now it's up to Asterix and Obelix to get him back. Good luck, boys.[CR]Asterix and the Great Rescue is a wonderful game with awesome graphics that reflect not only the French Comic that it was modeled after, but also the TV series that followed. The music closely follows the score from the TV series, and the story line of the game follows the crazy antics that Asterix and Obelix usually get themselves into.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Asterix and the Great Rescue is a fun but difficult game that takes you through six levels, each with 4 stages. The levels are the Gaulish Village, the Roman encampment, the Forest, Germany, the Roman Galley, and Rome itself.[CR]After you complete each stage, or if you die, you are given a choice as to whether you want to continue playing with the character you had or choose the other.[CR]The differences between Asterix and Obelix are as follows: Asterix is small and fast, and can jump high and crawl under spaces; whereas Obelix is big and strong, with a harder punch that does more damage, and can break through objects that Asterix can not.[CR]At the end of the fourth stage of each level (except for the Gaulish village) you will have to fight a boss, which is slightly bigger than the normal enemies and usually requires patience and some sort of strategy to beat. Level 2 and 3 you fight a Roman Centurion, Level 4 you fight the Germanic chief, Level 5 you fight Brutus, and Level 6 you fight Julius Caesar, the mastermind behind the kidnap of your druid.[CR]Along your way you will pick up various items that will help you. Getafix (the druid) has left behind potions that do different things, such as create clouds that you can stand on for a short period of time, and others that explode and can be used as bombs, which you can toggle trough by holding \"up\" and pushing \"C\". Also along your way you will pick up food, that restores your health, which is located in the top left of the screen; coins, which add to your score and can give you more lives if you collect enough; and sickles, that will make you temporarily invincible, much like the stars in Super Mario Bros. All in all, Asterix and the Great Rescue is a fun game, and you shouldn't let its difficulty discourage you. So sit down, log in, and have fun!

In addition to the 20-team league that names the game and the State of Origin, a competition between two selections of players from New South Wales and Queensland, an European League (composed by twelve teams) and international playoffs (eight) are also available. It is possible to play friendlies, or jump straight to the club competition playoffs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is simple, and focus on quick passing and running rather than kicking to gain distance. The A button controls kicks the ball (tackles in defense), B passes (or changes players) and C rushes and breaks tackles. There are a few additional tricks, such as pressing A+B to perform a short, lobbed kick or A+C to clear the ball from the defense. Kicking from a dead ball situation uses a three-click method. The first sets the bar in motion, the second the strength, and the third the accuracy. The stronger the shot, the less accurate it will be, and the initial position of the kicker also affects the direction of the ball. Each button represents a different ball height, from A (which is the lowest) to C (highest). Weather also affects how the game is played, as high temperatures with hard grounds make longer games tougher on the players (slowing them down) and cold, wet weather makes passing the ball more difficult.",

The game featured a large amount of digitized speech.[CR]The game features a strong environmentalist message. Awesome Possum collects recyclable materials including cans and bottles, the main enemies in the game are evil robots who are destroying the rainforest, and the main villain is Dr. Machino, whose goal is to destroy the Earth by way of pollution.

                "plot": "[CR]Ayrton Senna himself helped develop this game.[CR]Made by Sega in 1992, this game was released on all of Sega's consoles including the Genesis, Master System and Game Gear.[CR]The most fleshed out version was the Genesis one. In it one could race through two main modes. The first was Senna GP which players could race on a Senna designed track, and the second was the world championship mode.[CR]The world championship mode had two settings: Beginner and Master. The Beginner mode was a straightforward drivers championship, where the driver at the end of the season with the most points was the winner.[CR]The Master mode included the concept of teams and rival drivers. In this mode, players were put in a team with the objective of advancing to better teams until eventually taking Senna's place at the top of the food chain.Meet Nigel Mansell's unlicensed cousin[CR]Players could challenge rival drivers and replace them in the team if they won.[CR]The teams were arranged in 5 tiers with the master himself in a separate class altogether. The game was unlicensed, so all the rival drivers and teams were likenesses of real ones. Even Senna's team in the game was an original team called \"Madonna\" as opposed to his real team at the time, McClaren.[CR]The tracks were relatively close to their real life counterparts, and Senna advised developers about track characteristics. They even followed the order of the real life Formula 1 calendar. Each track had some unique background elements such as a city or forest. Some tracks even featured rain on random occasions.[CR]Even with all these realistic elements, the games handling could best be described as arcadey. This was characteristic of console racing games of the time. More realistic racing games could be found on the PC, but for many Genesis owners, Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II brought Formula 1 home.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Upon release, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores: 6,8,6,5 adding, \"...this is a game that only a dyed-in-the-wool racer will love. The first SMGP set new standards in driving simulations and, while this version smooths out the rough edges, it does not break any new ground\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hang-On Mode[CR]To play the game with a bike from Super Hang-On instead of a Formula 1, first select World Championship =&gt; New Game =&gt; Master Mode. In the \"Name Entry\" screen, input \"HANG-ON!\" at the \"Name\" section, then select \"Ed\". A screen of Ayrton Senna talking to you will now appear: at that moment, press the Reset button of your console. Go back to the main screen, and now select \"Free Practice\". Select your race track normally; then, on the next two selections (Image Training/Free Run, and Grid/Laps), choose your settings, and validate each of them by pressing and holding the buttons Down + A together until the next selection appears (on the Image Training/Free Run selection, make sure to press up or down once, before pressing and holding Down + A, so you validate the code on \"Image Training\": the Hang-On mode is only playable in Image Training Mode). After this, you'll enter the Transmission Selection screen: select your transmission normally. If the inputs were done correctly, you'll now play with a Super Hang-On bike.",

B.O.B. was also included as a part of the  EA Replay compilation which was released for the  PSP handheld in 2006.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]B.O.B. is just a common teenage  robot looking to score his dad\u2019s car keys and get to his hot date. After a long lecture from his father about responsibility and how he\u2019ll never drive again if there\u2019s even a single scratch, B.O.B.\u2019s journey to pick up his hot date begins. Whilst cruising through the universe in his dad\u2019s pimped out pink space Cadillac and listening to rock n\u2019 roll full blast on the stereo, B.O.B. blindly wanders into an asteroid field and proceeds to plow his father\u2019s car straight into the side of an asteroid. B.O.B. crash lands on a mysterious planet filled with hostile robots and creatures. He proceeds to blast his way through every last baddie and boss the foul planet has to throw at him until he finally reaches the end where he finds a brand new car. From there he continues on to find himself a hot fembot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]B.O.B. is at its core a shooter. The player starts with only a standard single shot weapon, but there are five additional ammo types the can be collected throughout the world. These consist of a  spread shot,  flamethrower,  missiles, lightning, and wave. If B.O.B. happens to run low on ammo, he is able to perform a  melee attack by throwing a massive  fist. In addition to standard weapons, there are six remotes that can be collected to help B.O.B. make it through the hostile terrain. These include items which not only are offensive, but also some that make B.O.B. more able to navigate through the twists, turns, and obstacles that he faces. The remotes include a light, a protective shield that grants  temporary invincibility, an  umbrella that slows B.O.B.\u2019s descent on long drops, a  spring that allows for high jumps, a propeller that allows B.O.B. to fly for short distances, and a time bomb that clears the screen of all enemies. B.O.B.\u2019s  health can be refilled by picking up the wrench item or by stepping into a recharger.[CR]B.O.B. moves between levels linearly via an  overworld map. Unlike other shooters, B.O.B. is not a strictly walk from left to right affair though. The game combines the shooting elements with platforming elements and presents worlds filled with obstacles where the player must navigate up, down, left, and right. In addition to standard levels, there are also some vehicle levels where B.O.B. has to fly a car through a maze-like environment to the finish line. A  time-limit is present on every stage. Once the timer goes down to zero, B.O.B.\u2019s life will start quickly depleting until either the player reaches the end of the stage or B.O.B. dies.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR]Master System[CR]First levelWeeeee \u2026This is the first of only three levels. In this one, your goal is to catch the carriage before it drops down the cliff. You take on the role of Doc Brown riding a horse from left to right, fighting your way through birds, flying tomahawks, and all kinds of random obstacles. Doc Brown can only shoot in three directions (up, down, up/right) and duck to avoid birds. The level is borderline cheap, enemies and barriers usually pop in just in front of the horse, recalling bad memories of the infamous race level in Battletoads.  There is also a number of items in this level. Many of them only give scorepoints (e. g. several pieces of laundry the Doc can pick up), others enable a short boost or grant the Doc additional time. The number of remaining lives (three in total) is indicated by a clock in the lower right corner. The sheer number of instant death possibilities alone makes it hard to memorize the fixed pattern.Second levelYou are Marty McFly, posing as Clint Eastwood, and your goal is to defeat six baddies located in two buildings, one of them a large saloon, by means of flying plates.  Please don't hit my heart! The HUD gives you some important information this time. In the upper left corner are six cupboard cutouts of the bad guys. Each enemy takes two hits, after that the respective cupboard turns down. Below is the  high score counter and a small shield, which looks like a failed attempt at drawing a metal plate. Sometimes graphical glitches appear in this area, which are actually supposed to be bullet holes in the shield. Eventually, Marty's heart (!) will be exposed and the next hit instantly leads to a game over since there are no extra lives in this level. To the right of the shield is a stack of plates. Marty can throw ten plates before he has to reload by walking to the table at the bottom of the screen. Quite confusingly, the HUD indicator shows far more plates than ten, rendering it pretty useless. Marty himself can only move sideways, with each position corresponding to a predefined plate trajectory, some of which are clearly violating Newton's laws of physics. Third levelMarty does the Turrican Still controlling Marty, the player is now on a train and has to reach the locomotive. In addition to that, Marty must pick up  intentionally inconspicuously placed rectangular items of unknown purpose. Furthermore, these have to be picked up in a specific order which is given as a string of colored squares in the upper middle of the screen. As if that wasn't complicated enough, the designers also implemented a relentless time limit, giving the player only the tiniest leeway. There is once again a number of arbitrary obstacles (e. g. some sort of hook on a pole), but instead of suffering instant deaths, the player gets punished with a substantial time loss. A crude lifebar (it's really just five red blobs) in the lower right corner indicates Marty's health. If it's completely drained, he falls off the train and several precious seconds are lost yet again. Control wise, Marty is in full Turrican mode here. He can shoot sideways, jump, climb, and even do the famous barrel roll. The controls feel rather sluggish, though. Combined with the crazy time limit and overall difficulty, this level isn't exactly the second coming of Super Mario Brot.[CR]",

Behind them is a conveyor belt with large metal balls rotating around. The goal is to capture the opponent's balls and hold them until their timer runs out. Each crab has two claws which operate independently; they can be used to grab balls from the opposite side of the screen, as well as to knock them out of the opponent's grip. The player must also be careful, as taking a hit from behind will damage the crab, and if it takes too much damage then the crab must return to the pit area to be repaired.[CR]There are several game modes included. The main focus is the World Championship mode, in which one player takes on a succession of increasingly skilled computer opponents. Also available is a two-player versus mode with a number of handicap options. There is also a training mode where the player can freely practice to get a feel for the controls, as well as a time trial mode where the goal is to grab as many balls as possible within the time limit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Galaxy Championship[CR]At the dim title screen, hold UP-RIGHT on the D-pad while pressing start to access the Galaxy Championship, which is a more challenging single player tournament that will replace the World Championship on the mode selection screen.",

Mostly, it consists of her daydreaming and avoiding obstacles while also trying to look good and perfect her routine. The game features multiple stages filled with mini-games. At the mid-point of each stage, the player practices a catwalk routine, and then must replicate the same routine at the end of each stage.[CR]The game has two difficulty levels: Junior Model (Easy) and Super Model (Hard).[CR]Short-lived developers Tahoe Software Productions created the game for the Super Nintendo, the Sega Genesis and PC DOS. A Sega Game Gear version was planned but canceled mid-development.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Barbie Super Model consists of very linear stages. It has four stages in total:Driving Stage[CR]This stage features Barbie driving a pink car and having to avoid other cars, who are driving quite dangerously.Rollerskating Stage[CR]This stage requires Barbie avoid other people and birds.Cycling Stage[CR]This stage features Barbie on a bicycle. She has to avoid birds and frisbees.Hiking Stage[CR]This stage features Barbie hiking through snow. She must avoid people towing sleds, icy patches on the ground and snowballs.[CR]Mini-games[CR]Each stage consists of the same three mini-games. These are:Body Magazine Cover[CR]Here, the player has to match Barbie's clothes to those shown on the magazine color. Barbie has a vast wardrobe, and the player is also expected to manually change colors if needed.Catwalk Practice[CR]Before turning around and going back the other way on every stage, the player is told a sequence of buttons to press to make up Barbie's modelling routine. They can practice it as many times as they like, but they need to memorize the buttons for later.Face Magazine Cover[CR]This is similar to the first mini-game, except the magazine cover shows Barbie's face instead. The player must match Barbie's accessories and make up to resemble her cover shot on the magazine.[CR]At the end of each level, the catwalk practice sequence is then used again, this time without prompts. The player must do the same sequence again from memory.[CR]",

                "title_clean": "Batman - The Video Game",
                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Batman: The Video Game is very loosely based on 1989's hit Tim Burton film, starring Michael Keaton. While the game features cut scenes derived from the film itself, many of the elements are taken from the comic book, such as boss fights. On the other hand, there are plenty of elements that are completely created for the video game such as the many mechanical enemies Batman faces off with. The video game saw much critical acclaim as being a quality title based off of a popular license, something that is still hard to find to this day.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The player uses the standard D-Pad controls to move Batman around from left to right whereas down makes Batman duck, a very useful ability when fighting enemies with projectiles. The B button is used to punch, Batman's most useful ability, or use his equipped weapon. The A button is used to jump and Batman does a lot of it in this game. Batman will often times use the wall jump ability to bypass many of the platforming elements within the game or to find hidden shortcuts around powerful enemies. Strangely enough, the Start Button allows Batman to switch weapons whereas the Select Button pauses the game.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Fisticuffs - Batman's primary default attack is punching, which turns out to be rather helpful. In fact, it's Batman's most useful attack. It conserves ammo, it destroys most enemies in only a few hits if less, and it stays true to his martial roots. Batman would go on to punch goons throughout video games.[CR]Batarang - Batman's boomerang weapon consumes one unit of ammo per shot but would hit enemies multiple times. This is the weapon Batman should use when trying to hit enemies from a limited range but too far to punch in the face.[CR]Spear Gun - This gun shoots spears! This trademark Batman weapon fires projectiles that can hit an enemy across the screen and consumes two units of ammo. Useful when trying to kill an enemy standing on a platform that Batman is jumping to with no room to punch it.[CR]Dirk - This special, powerful attack forms three discs that shoot towards an enemy. While it has limited range, the attack is useful against enemies that are proving a nuisance from a step below. The attack uses three units of ammo per shot, but is meant to be used sparingly.[CR]Power Ups[CR]Bonus Item - Gives Batman 1000 points. Even in 1990, points were still relevant.[CR]Pellet Item - Gives Batman 10 units of ammo, used in all of his weapons.[CR]Heart Item - Fills up one of Batman's eight hit points.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Shakedown and Maxiezeus (Standard Goon) - The very first enemy Batman faces is the standard, suicidal henchman who runs up to the caped crusader, dying instantly against a pummeling fist from Bats. The standard fodder that will appear at least once per stage.[CR]Mobile Tracker (Spike Bot) - A little robot that skims across the ground quickly when in sight of Batman. Two spikes alternate on top of its frame, threatening to stab Batman's tender little feet if he were to land on it after attempting to jump over.[CR]Heatwave (Flamethrower Goon) - This stationary henchman kneels down while firing his flamethrower every few moments. The orange cone eventually shuts off, allowing Batman to swoop in and land a few punches into his face. One of the primary enemies in the game, meant to challenge the player through difficult wall jumping elements.[CR]Deadshot (Gun Goon) - Another stationary henchman who would rather stand still while shooting every once in a while at the Batman. Easy enough to evade and rather weak in combat. These goons don't show up very often in the game.[CR]Mobile Home Mine (Mine Bot) - A little mine that skitters across the ground within the proximity of Batman. Easy enough to evade and never truly becomes a threat.[CR]The Enforcer (Jetpack Goon) - A rare enemy that only shows up in the first stage, firing his machine gun at Batman while flying above him in his jetpack. A few well-placed batarangs can make short work of him.[CR]K.G.Beast (Ninja) - Only one appearance throughout the entire game within the first stage and he is a total let down. Batman can easily dispatch this ninja by walking up to his side and throwing a few batarangs at him before he even notices Batman's presence.[CR]Nightslayer (Claw Goon) - Introduced in the second stage, these guys are slow moving henchmen equipped with massive claws on their hand. Powerful and hard to evade, but swift to dispatch.[CR]Javelin (Drill Bot) - Introduced in the second stage, this stationary robot extends its javelin-like head in a pattern of thrusts. Play more of a challenging role in wall jumping areas, but is otherwise easy to dispatch.[CR]Drop Claw - Also introduced in the second stage is a ceiling-mounted dispenser of claw bots, little claws that run along the ground to harm the Batman.[CR]Jader (Mutant Goon) - Batman runs across these biological weapons in the third stage. They are very hard to evade as their large bodies jump around swiftly as they try to attack Batman. There are not many of them around, but they do make platforming elements much more difficult.[CR]EEV (Tank Goon) - Introduced in the caverns of stage three, this goon-controlled mini-tank shoots powerful projectiles at Batman.[CR]Rail Runner (Rail Bot) - This robot makes a brief appearance through stage four. Moving on a horizontal rail, it moves left to right trying to bash Batman.[CR]Locations[CR]Stage 1[CR]Gotham CityKiller Moth[CR]This stage is split up between three sub-stages. In Main Street (1-1), Batman fights off standard goons and spike bots. In the first area, Batman passes by a Don't Walk sign post and a Theater (presumably the same theater outside of which his parents were gunned down) twice in an unfortunate sign of recycled content. In High-Rise Buildings (1-2), Batman is forced to practice his wall jump abilities, one of the trademark abilities within the video game. This is the stage in which players pit Batman against jetpack goons and a very laid back ninja.[CR]The Front of City Hall (1-3) is Batman's first boss fight, Killer Moth. Ripped straight from the comics, Killer Moth fires up the jetpack within his metallic \"wings\" and flies around from side to side, swooping down to ram Batman. Killer Moth will also fire several blue firebolts across the screen from above. In the cutscene proceeding the boss' defeat, Batman hops into the batmobile and blasts through a metal door, blowing open a path to drive through.Stage 2[CR]Axis Chemical FactoryGluk[CR]The second stage is split up into four sub-stages. In the Liquid Waste Floor sub-stage (2-1), Batman encounters claw goons and his first true platforming challenge, jumping across small platforms suspended above a massive vat of toxic chemicals (Gluk) while the green sludge also drips from above. In the Spark Floor sub-stage (2-2), Batman faces even more platforming challenges against deadly high voltage wires and drill bots, including plenty of wall jumping. The Conveyer-Belt Floor (2-3) introduces the claw bots, which yield plenty of power-ups upon the simple, continuous defeats. Unfortunately for Batman, this also marks the appearance of moving treads, guiding Batman towards deadly spinning blades while he fights off more flamethrower and gun goons.[CR]In the Nerve Center (2-4), Batman is locked in with the Machine Intelligence System, forming a three-part boss fight. The first section is straight across from where Batman starts out, firing two projectiles in rapid succession. After the wall-mounted turrets are destroyed, the second section is accessed just above. The electric current controller across from Batman is protected by four ceiling-mounted chemical dispensers dripping onto a moving tread. After the orb is destroyed, the high voltage wire guarding the Nerve Center blows up, revealing a larger glowing orb that shifts into a three-way spread turret before shifting back into the weak point. Batman swiftly destroys the blue glowing orb before cutting to the next scene, showing Joker with a pistol, speaking his catchphrase \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? Ha ha ha. . . . . .\" before firing his gun.Stage 3[CR]Underground ConduitElectrocutioner[CR]In Underground Conduit I (3-1), Batman immediately faces off against the mutant goon for the first time. Blue water flows down, making the scene similar to a sewer level, popular among st comic book games. There are more platforming and wall jumping elements that test Batman here, but also throw in deadly grinding fans within the waist-deep water. In Underground Conduit II (3-2), the scenery is immediately changed as the water becomes a bright green. While wading through the viscus sewer water, Batman fights off against more Heatwaves and spike bots. After a brief wall-jumping section, Batman climbs up to the Underground Cavern (3-3). This large, cavernous area introduces the goon-driven tank, the EEV. After facing off with those, Batman faces a more difficult challenge in strategically placed flamethrower goons and mine bots as he wall jumps across more grinding fans whilst scaling the caverns. Perhaps the introduction of vertical combat?[CR]Stage 3-4. Defeat the Electrocutioner. Taken straight from the DC comic, Electrocutioner is equipped with a massive claw on his left hand while his right hand is replaced with a massive 10 Mega-Giga volt beam called the Moon Attacker. This sword-like beam creates a devistating attack that fills the bottom half of the screen with a large electric arc and jumps back and forth from left to right. After this monstrousity is destroyed, the Joker shows up again.[CR]Joker: \"Welcome, Batman, why don't you look at my latest work of art?\"Stage 4[CR]Laboratory RuinsHe Recorded Over CSI.[CR]In the Research Laboratory (4-1), Batman starts out in a futuristic backdrop where flashing conduits are seen against the metallic floors. While traversing the lab, Batman is attacked by se veral mechanical enemies and the mutant Jader creatures. In the foreground, there are strange cylinders filled with green liquid and three television screens with the Joker's laughing face broadcasting. The Storage Room (4-2) is marked by the Joker's trademark greens and purples. Batman starts out platform jumping over several grinding gears from below. Soon, the same gears are cranking from all sides.[CR]Once Batman enters the Thermal Processing Plant (4-3), Batman starts out across from the Exit door he must reach, but the jump is too far. In this area, he jumps down several floors evading the dangerous track bots and live circuits. There's also a large pool of flames that Batman must avoid at all cost. Part of the laboratory here is starting to deteriorate. Eventually, Batman comes to several tiny moving treads that he must use to platform and wall jump while evading Mobile Units and live circuits. Finally, he accends the stairs, fighting off several enemies to reach the Exit door.[CR]The Dual-Container Alarm (4-4) are two large cubes that move opposite each other across the room's walls. Both of these containers fire projectiles at Batman to the left and to the right. These containers are very slow moving and can be evaded easily if Batman fights in the proper area. After the first container is destroyed, the remaining cube enters a state of emergency, opening from the top and erupting with several fire bombs. These six projectiles move across the screen and can be hard to avoid as the container skims across the bottom of the room.[CR]After the boss is defeated, Batman hops into his Batwing and flies towards the Cathedral where the Joker has escaped to.Stage 5[CR]Gotham City CathedralFirebug.[CR]When Batman enters the Stairway (5-1), he's immediately faced with more grinding gears and more flamethrower goons. After scaling the stairway, Batman then begins to scale the Belltower itself. This involves an epic wall jump scenario wherein Batman must avoid several javelin bots, grinding gears, flamethrowers, Mobile Units and Drop Claws. Perhaps this was the implimentation of today's Vertical Combat concept?[CR]Batman is thrust immediately into a boss fight (5-2) against Firebug. Working as Joker's bodyguard, Firebug wants revenge against the Batman for defeating his brother. This horned villain from the comic books conjures six-hundred million degree fireballs, tossing them at Batman while he jumps around the stage rapidly. Firebug is easy enough to defeat, but leads into the final battle with The Joker.[CR]Joker: \"Greetings Batbrain - Are you ready to meet your destiny?\"The Joker.[CR]The final confrontation (5-3) pits Batman against The Joker himself. Wearing the trademark purple suit and green hair, The Joker fires powerful bullets from the massive, long pistol he uses in the film before, of course, summoning three lightning bolts. They have to make a boss fight against a mastermind like The Joker more interesting, right? After a tough, strategic battle, Batman knocks The Joker out. He tries to stand, but only manages to fall back down in defeat. Cue the next cutscene.[CR]Batman: \"I know you murdered my parents. Now you will dance with the devil in the pale moonlight.\"[CR]Then throws him off the very top of the belltower. We see The Joker fall from the belltower then a shot of his body alone, underneath a streetlamp before a close up on his smiling face fades to black. Roll credits.[CR]Release[CR]While Batman: The Video Game was ported to numerous systems (including the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive - which is often considered the best version of the game), the NES and Game Boy versions were the only versions released in North America. This was because of Nintendo's strict policies for third-party publishers during the this era. In addition to limiting the number of games a publisher could release per year and heavily moderating the level of questionable content allowed in these games, Nintendo also demanded console exclusivity for released games; a game released on their system was not allowed to be released on a competitor's system. Many publishers got around this by exploiting a loophole that allowed them to license their properties to competing companies to create their own ports of the games (which is why games such as Ninja Gaiden, R-Type and Double Dragon were able to appear on Sega's competing 8-bit system, the Master System - Sega was granted the licenses for these properties and developed these versions themselves), but Batman was already ported and reprogrammed for a Genesis release. With no way to release the game for both systems in North America, Sunsoft chose to release the NES version, most likely because of the system's continued success and install base (the Genesis was not even a year old at the time of Batman's release). However, Mega Drive versions were released in Europe and Japan where Nintendo had no such third-party policies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Defensive position when being shot[CR]When Batman is being shot, press Start to pause the game. And then hold the B button and press Start to resume the game.

Loosely based on the 1995 film of the same name, up to two players team up as either Batman or his sidekick Robin as they set out to foil the plans of criminal Two-Face and puzzler The Riddler. Unlike traditional beat 'em up games, Batman Forever combines 2D platforming with fighting game controls (in similar vein to Mortal Kombat). The game features a non-linear level structure (with puzzles) and fully-digitized actors.[CR]The game was ported to the Game Gear, Game Boy, and PC by Probe. Another Acclaim-published beat 'em up based on the same movie was released for arcades in 1996 under the same name. Also sporting fully-digitized actors, it was later released for the PlayStation and Saturn as Batman Forever: The Arcade Game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can choose between playing as the Caped Crusader or his sidekick, Robin or can even add a second controller for co-operative play.[CR]The fighting aspect of the game resembles the engine for the \"Mortal Kombat\" games, right down to the motion-captured characters and the basic fighting moves (uppercut, high and low punch, etc).[CR]Players can also choose what gadgets to bring along in each level, which each gadget having it's own pro's and cons. Arguably, the most useful gadget is the grappling hook, which gets the character to higher parts of the level that couldn't be reached before.[CR]The game includes many secrets, such as different hidden gadgets and multiple \"riddles\" from The Riddler himself.[CR]",

Looks fun though.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Two mercenary ladies with a need for destruction. The premise is not of the usual kind of shooter. But the rest is fairly common to all of us: containers with power-ups, flashing shots and a gigantic enemy army.[CR]Typical and reasonably challenging shooter action with some quick puzzles around on certain stages to break the ice. The gamer (playing the role of the mercenary Mania Ohtori, also known as ''Madison'') has the partnership of Maria ''Crystal'' Waneda (whom is equipped with a heavy bazooka) and a weapon pod (which the gamer selects amongst four different types and each one is capable of a devastating attack when activated at a full charge weapon bar). The funny and strange elements of the game, such as the little lab hamster - and others that the gamer will find while delving further into the game, frenetic action and ausence of slomo are its gameplay's greatest assets.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]From MIJET's site:[CR]\"In what has become a MIJET trademark, this is a \"dual-language\" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English. However, it goes far beyond simply supporting both English and the original Japanese; it contains two different English translations and a selection of three English fonts.[CR]This patch is contained within two different IPS files, but the only differences between the two are the default script and font to use if none are selected by the user. That's correct; it is possible to select the desired script and font by holding down certain combinations of buttons prior to the Sega logo appearing. See the included documentation for more details.\"[CR]They even fixed some bugs that were in the original. How 'bout those guys, huh?

It deviates very little from the established norm for shooters of the time, but it did provide relatively larger sprites. It is considered a sequel to the 1988 Amiga shooter Hybris, which did not appear on the Sega Genesis. While not officially listed as a sequel, the team that developed Hybris, Martin Pedersen and Torban Larsen, guided the development of Battle Squadron. The Amiga version of Battle Squadron is considered the superior version, providing better graphics, sound, and controls, which include mouse controls.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Battle Squandron revolves around the characters of Berry Mayers and Lori Bergin, in absentia. Having been taken prisoner by the Barrax Empire, they possess critical knowledge to thwart the evil threat. Likewise, the Barrax Empire are endeavoring to acquire critical information about Earth's defenses. The player's mission, of course, is to save the prisoners and repel the Barrax Empire before they do you, the Earth, and the whole lot in.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is often cited as a competent vertical scrolling shooter, while not deviating from the basic elements of gameplay as established by the genre. The player flies his spaceship as the levels scroll from top to bottom.Battle Squandron features 25 different power ups spread across four different types of weapon: particle beam, energy ball, magma wave, and laser. The player is also provided a full-screen clearing Nova Bomb, 3 to start with more that can be acquired during play.A variety of enemy types exist, including space ships, ground based turrents and tanks, genetically engineered living weapons. Some enemies feature cloaking devices that make them harder to track down for a clean shot.Each level ends with a screen filling multi level boss.[CR]",

                "plot": "BATTLEMASTER: The Age of Conflict[CR]Not much is known about the creation of the world. The best we have to go on is the ancient book of Atan, passed down through thousands of generations, whispering to us the secrets of the Legend of Creation. This is its story.[CR]The Four Lords of Creation shaped the world from the random dynamics of time and space. This we know, thanks to the chronicles written by Aran, the first king and potentate of all Magic. It was he who possessed the Keystone of Life set deep into a golden crown. With it he determined the flux of Magical power. He was the chronicler of this world's past, and his chapters are known as the Age of Peace.[CR]Just before his death--after all of his kind had died--he crafted a final entry into the Book of Aran and placed it in a crystal case to protect his words from the scars of time. In a final act of despair, he shattered his crown with the Keystone of Life, splitting it into uncountable shards, left behind in his Tower.[CR]All life ended for a time, but as things go, life returned to our planet, four races led by four kins, wearing crowns bearing the main shards of the splintered Keystone of Life. Each had a queen at his side; all wandered from Aran's Tower to build their kingdoms and weave their own tapestry in the world. And in time, other dark and nameless creatures crept from the cauldrons, bearing the tiny shards of the Keystone that created them, following the kings into a new world.[CR]Four races developed and prospered: Elves, Dwarves, Humans and Orcs. As time passed, the four territories crossed, and their differences spilled out of the shadows. The Elves are a natural people, loving sunlight and forest shade--a tall, fair and elegant species, always vigilant against attack. They have one skill on their side--a knowledge of Magic. They protect their culture with the double-edged sword of defense and art. Theirs is the first great empire, sprawling the central forest of Aldarien and the vast tree belt of the Southlands.[CR]The Dwarves, too, are a solitary race. They are short and stocky, and few in number. As creatures of habit--mainly miners, builders and smiths--their psyche is governed by a desire to delve forever deeper for the magical core metal of the world. They are a disparate, hostile people, going wherever the mining is good, given to territorial defense. Their main settlements are close to the Tower, the place now known as Naugarth, the Dwarf realm.[CR]Men are the Land's farmers. They breed quickly because their lifespan is short, and this makes them more desperate than most. They rejected the power of Magic long, long ago, choosing instead the path of science. They have always been an expansionist species and they soon spread their corruption into the Great Plain and east into Hardor.[CR]Finally, this world hosts Orcs. These creatures, as has been well recorded elsewhere, are warriors--efficient fighting machines who live and die by sword and statecraft, craving power and glory. An Orc runs from battle when it calculates that the odds are against it.[CR]So, the world was divided among the races. The Elves ruled the forests, the Dwarves held the underworld, Men ploughed the plains and the Orcs held sway over the wastes and mountains. The Age of Conflict begins.[CR]After many years of interracial conflict had devastated the land and its inhabitants, the Watcher came and settled in Aran's Tower. From warring and poverty, all four races have slowly declined, their economies and towns crumbling in unison. Once there were great cities here; now there are villages and settlements. Once there were huge nations; now there are dwindling rows of stragglers. Once there were empires; now there are memories.[CR]No one knows from where the Watcher came. Or why. Perhaps he was an emissary from the Lords of Creation-- a restorer of balance. He has withdrawn the gift of Magic--wizards have no power, and the only sorcery in the land emanates from artifacts fashioned before he arrived. It is a time for union: to this end, he has cast a spell of apathy upon the four kings, and spoken this prophecy:[CR] \"Where there is chaos, there will be order;[CR] where discord, harmony will flourish. From[CR] the south will come a hero to conquer the land[CR] and unite the crowns. Where there were[CR] fragments, there will be a whole. Then will a[CR] new age begin.\"[CR]The land awaits its hero.[CR]--From the Genesis Battlemaster instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Choose from 1 of 4 races to go across the continent town by town, killing off monsters and other armies and their leaders to pass to the next area on your map. You must become the Battle Master![CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]After choosing a race of either human, elf, dwarf, or orc and picking a profession of thief, wizard, warrior, or merchant, you set out on a journey to prove that the words of the watcher are true, and that you are the Battle Master. As you make your way through, you follow the map that is provided to head to your next destination. Use magic to ward off the toughest of enemies or go head-on with your sword or club. Watch out for traps in the ground and other sneaky surprises. Check everywhere you go for potions or hidden items. Rationing health and items, you make your way to the end of your journey.

The game begins aboard the space ship \u2018The Vulture\u2019 where Battletoads Rash, Zitz, and Pimple (all disgustingly named after skin diseases) are escorting Princess Angelica back to her home planet. Pimple and Princess Angelica go cruisin\u2019 and get intercepted by the game\u2019s villain, the Dark Queen of Ragnarok. Both are kidnapped and taken back to Ragnarok. The Professor (captain of The Vulture) takes Rash and Zitz to \u2018rumble\u2019 with the Dark Queen on Ragnarok and \u2018get the Princess and Pimple back.\u2019 The remainder of the game takes place on planet Ragnarok where Rash and Zitz set off to save their friend Pimple and Princess Angelica.Gameplay[CR]While the first level is a typical 2d beat em up similar to Double Dragon, other levels have a variety of gameplay styles, including rappelling down a pit, riding speed bikes and surfboards, navigating a level on a unicycle-like vehicle that can ride up walls and on the ceiling, etc. The main objective of each level is to defeat as many enemies and overcome as many obstacles as possible and reach the endpoint. General strategy is to memorize these obstacles[CR]and rely on quick reflexes to reach the end. The entire game rounds up to two difficult levels where you climb a tower and, at the end, reach the Dark Queen.[CR]The most memorable aspect of this game is the absurd difficulty. Not only did it employ a decent amount of memorization but reflexes had to be fast, even for veteran gamers. Another memorable moment for this game would be the humorous way enemies were finished off, be it by using a football helmet or sprouting horns and ramming the enemy off screen.[CR]When the game was released on the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it the scores of 8,8,8,7 saying, \"...one of the best Game Boy games I've ever played\". The Game Boy version had the same basic theme found in the NES adventure, with the toads using all of the same fighting moves. The levels and bosses however were entirely original.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Title Menu Cheats[CR]Enter in the codes at the title screen.",

It starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark woods with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the castle and enchants all animals around it. Initially the beast needs to protect the magic rose against the creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice become involved, and eventually the villagers who invade the castle.[CR]The game takes place in Beast's castle and the surrounding woods.

After regular levels, a sequence with a boss follows. There are also a few mini-games where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The game keeps track of the player's score, based on defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is an unlimited amount of continues and the story is told through static, drawn cut-scenes between missions.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]At the title screen enter the following code:",

A young prince is bored with the life in the palace, and one day manages to go outside the gate, distracting the guards. In the town he meets a young boy who looks very similar to him. The prince offers him to switch their clothes, because he wants to spend the day as an ordinary boy. But when he comes back to the palace, the guards don't recognize him in his beggar's clothes and refuse to let him in. A new life, full of danger and adventures, begins for the young prince...[CR]The game is conceived in the tradition of Japanese RPGs. You navigate the prince on the world map and around towns, fighting random enemies and descending into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from an isometric perspective. You can attack physically or use a variety of magic spells, classified in types. In the beginning of you turn you have a full SP bar; each action reduces it, and when it is depleted, your turn ends. You can for example heal, cast magic, and physically attack different enemies during the same turn. Your enemies utilize the same system and can unleash multiple attacks on you.",

The game has a series of elemental dungeons, where the player can acquire one of four elemental spirits needed to progress through the game. These can be upgraded through finding hidden \"spirit gems\" in the world, often using the corresponding spirit to find it.[CR]The Return of the Prince[CR]In Beyond Oasis, you play as the ever resourceful, Prince Ali. On one of his treasure hunts, Ali comes across an unchartedAli, escaping the island.[CR]island, and decides to explore the island's cave. There he discovers the Golden Armlet. Curious, Ali decides to put on the Armlet. As he does, a strange glow fills the cave. A face appears and begins to tell Ali that \"[m]any ages ago, a devastating battle was waged in the shadowlands of the Kingdom of Oasis...\", expounding that Ali must find the four spirits that the Golden Armlet governs, to stop the the evil of the one who wears the Silver Armlet. As the face disappears, the cave begins to shake and crumble. Ali swiftly makes his way back to the boat and escapes, and the island sinks below the ocean. Ali arrives at the shores of Oasis.[CR]Ali is in pretty good physical condition, and is able to preform various combat techniques, most of which involve flips and spins. He can also sprint for an unlimited amount of time.[CR]The Map[CR]Oasis[CR]The Map is used throughout the player's adventures to check the current location and itinerary. While the world is open, the player may only go to certain places through certain quests, revolving around one of the four spirits and beyond. While it may look small, Oasis is quite a big place, full of secret areas and challenges.[CR]The Four Spirits[CR]\"Dytto\" The Water Spirit[CR]The ever helpful Dytto can be a lifesaver in tough situations. She can be summoned from any source of water, including spouts of water and water droplets. She is key to surviving the hidden underground gauntlet.[CR]Abilities:Pressing the A button once will summon a \"Magic Bubble\" to stun enemies.Pressing the A button twice restores a significant portion of health.Holding the A button and releasing will summon a \"Magic Storm\", which will damage anything in its path.\"Efreet\" The Fire Spirit[CR]The mighty powerhouse Efreet can smash through enemies, and destroy certain structures with powerful fire attacks. He can be summoned from any fire, and, if fast enough, though explosions. Efreet punches enemies automatically, protecting you from most threats. Efreet is used to win the special race, using his fireball dash ability.[CR]Abilities:Pressing the A button once will cause Efreet to breathe fire, which can beset enemies and unlit torchesPressing the A button twice will cause Efreet to transform into a fireball, dashing at quick speed in the direction the player is facing.Holding the A button and releasing will summon a \"Melt Bomber\" firestorm, which can decimate multiple enemies, and also set unlit torches on fire.\"Shade\" The Shadow Spirit[CR]While not as attack focused, Shade offers a special passive effect, protecting you from attacks and saving you from falls unscathed. This, of course, comes at the price of the SP bar being reduced per hit and fall. Shade can be summoned from reflective surfaces, including Knight's armor.[CR]Abilites:Pressing the A button once will summon Shade's \"Dark Claw\", which can be used to grab hooks and hard-to-reach objects, as well as damage enemies.Holding the A button and releasing will cause Shade to become your \"doppelganger\", which can be used to solve certain \"puzzles\".\"Bow\" The Plant Spirit[CR]The hungry plant Bow is required often, to eat through certain green \"caged\" doors; however, he can also be used to attack. Bow can be summoned from tiny plant saplings.[CR]Abilities:Pressing the A button once will cause Bow to bite.Pressing the A button twice will summon Bow to where the player is standing.Holding the A button and releasing will cause Bow to pop, releasing \"Poison Pollen\", which slows and stuns enemies in the area.[CR]Food and Items[CR]Throughout the game a variety of foods can be used to restore health. These can be found in numerous areas and are often awards for defeating a room of enemies. Not all types of food will heal, however, as fruit will restore spirit. Some items will effect both statuses. Here is a comprehensive list of foods and their effects:[CR](H.P = Hit points[CR]S.P = Spirit Points)Cheese H.P 1/4Fish H.P 1/2Steak H.P 3/4Roast Beast H.P To FullOrange S.P 1/4Apple S.P 1/2Pomegranate S.P 3/4Grapes S.P To FullMushroom H.P/S.P 1/4Lettuce H.P/S.P 1/2Garlic H.P/S.P 3/4Toadstool H.P/S.P To Full[CR]There are also summon items, which can be used to summon a specific spirit, without having to use their traditional method of summoning. A pitcher of water will summon Dytto, a lantern will summon Efreet, a mirror will summon Shade, and a plant pot will summon Bow.[CR]Genesis Collection[CR]Beyond Oasis recently appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Even though Beyond Oasis was called The Story of Thor in other parts of the world (including Europe), the European \"Mega Drive Ultimate Collection\" version still contains an emulated version of \"Beyond Oasis\", even when the menu still says \"The Story of Thor\". This is easily understandable, as there is no reason to emulate a separate version of a game that is identical. The same applies to all of the box art for the games, which are all North American.[CR]Freeing Dytto earns a 20G Achievement[CR]Soundtrack & Trivia[CR]The game's soundtrack is provided by Yuzo Koshiro and his studio Ancient, and an early demo of the game's song 'Concentration' can be found on the Streets of Rage 3 soundtrack, which he also contributed to. Strangely, Ancient ported over most of the sound library from Streets of Rage 3 and while they can be found in the cartridge data, hardly any of them are used besides the item pickup/eat food sound.[CR]System Requirements[CR]OS: Windows\u00ae XP or higherProcessor: Intel Pentium 2.0 GHzMemory: 2GBGraphics: 32MB or greater graphics cardDirectX\u00ae: DirectX\u00ae 9.0 or greaterHard Drive: 50MB free disc space[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Best Players Screen[CR]To view the best players screen (which is firstly seen on completion of the game), press B + Start at the title screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Best Players Screen[CR]At the title screen, press and hold Down + Right + Start to view the demonstration.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Best Players Screen[CR]To instantly switch from your Alt.

The Sega Mega Drive version was developed and published by Ma-Ba, although certain elements were recycled from the Super Famicom version.[CR]The game is set in the first series of Sailor Moon, and you control one or two of the five heroines (Guardian Senshi). Each Senshi has some sequences of blows , three aerial attacks (neutral, moving forward/backward, downward) and a special charge-up projectile.[CR]The game is divided into five stages:[CR]    - Latin Quarter (boss: Bakene)[CR]    - Amusement Park (boss: Muurido)[CR]    - Secret Machine (boss: Zoisite disguised as Sailor Moon)[CR]    - North Pole (boss: Kunzite)[CR]    - Dark Kingdom (boss: Prince Endymion and Queen Beryl)[CR]NOTE: If the game is played on Easy Mode, only Stages 1 and 2 are playable, and the ending only shows a stationary image of the Inner Senshi with Usagi as Princess Serenity from the ending scene although the music does not play at that point.[CR]The five heroines are:[CR]    - Sailor Moon alias Usagi Tsukino; her special attack is Moon Tiara Action[CR]    - Sailor Mercury alias Ami Mizuno; her special attack is Shabon Spray. She is faster than the other Senshi but has a shorter attack. She has a move where she can slam enemies into the ground, making the level shake.[CR]    - Sailor Mars alias Rei Hino; her default attack is the kick, which is stronger than her punch. Her special attack is Fire Soul.[CR]    - Sailor Jupiter alias Makoto Kino; her special attack is Supreme Thunder. She is stronger than any other Senshi and is the only one who jabs enemies with a fist, she does not flip anytime she jumps, and is the second Senshi that can slam enemies on the ground making the level rumble rapidly.[CR]    - Sailor Venus alias Minako Aino; the only Sailor Senshi who uses a weapon (a chain) in battle - her special attack is Crescent Beam. She is the most difficult Senshi to control, but her chain has a better reach than the other Senshi that are unarmed.[CR]The enemies are mostly the youma of the Dark Kingdom that appeared in the anime, but if more than one of the same kind appears at once, the others are coloured differently (a common device for this genre of games):[CR]    - Akan[CR]    - Crane Arashino Joe[CR]    - Garoben[CR]    - Jumeau[CR]    - Jiji[CR]    - Chiffon Puppet (unique to the game)[CR]    - Clown (unique to the game)[CR]    - Female magician (unique to the game)[CR]This game was translated into French in Europe, but was never imported to the United States. In the French translation, there were many errors:[CR]    ?If the player loses the game, \"SIN\" is displayed onscreen, rather than \"FIN\" (\"GAME OVER\").[CR]    - After each level, Tuxedo Mask appears to grade each Senshi's performance. If the player gets a \"C\", he says \"MOYENE\" (a non-existent word) rather than \"MOYENNE\" (\"Average\").[CR]    - Sailor Venus was renamed \"Sailor Mathilde\" on the screen where Tuxedo Mask grades each Senshi's performance.[CR]    - The final scene's dialogue has many incomplete sentences.[CR]The Mega Drive counterpart had most of the stages from the SNES game but a few were removed such as the time dimension but had a new stage where you ride an elevator and a roof stage and has different boss battles along with a hidden final boss, Queen Metallia if playing on Hard Mode. The Mega Drive counterpart did not conain any of the music from the SNES game, with the exception of the main theme song at the title screen, bosses also had their own song rather than sharing the same one. The game had different endings depending on which character you play as.[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon_video_games[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Final Boss[CR]In order to unlock the special boss fight at the end of the game, you must beat the game by defeating Queen Beryl on hard mode and then you will be taken to another boss fight. This boss does NOT have a health gauge and can only be defeated by attacking its giant eye a certain amount of times.",

There is the huntress(fast character), the warrior(powerful character), and the sorcerer(ranged character). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses and are somewhat balanced.[CR]The game features simplistic, 2-D environments and fantasy combat. Enemies are typical representations of fantasy lore and each level ends with a boss to conquer. Many secret areas can be found in each level, along with many items to help ease the character through the tougher boss battles.[CR]Each level has a few power-ups that will evolve the player character a bit, changing their appearance as well as the strength of their attack. There's a bit more customizability via an item shop which can be accessed between levels.[CR]The game is somewhat of a challenge, even though extra lives can be bought throughout the game with collected coins. Once a player has run out of lives and continues the game was over and would have to be started over. Lives were easy to lose as well since there were many chances for the character to fall to their death.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Level Select[CR]In the first level, play through the first part of the level all the way until you get to the door that takes you to a new part of the level.  This is the door near the button on the ground that pops out a treasure chest behind you.  Use your jump attack to jump onto an invisible platform just over the left part of the top of the door.  It's fairly difficult to reach, unless you are the girl, but you can reach it with any character.  Once you're up there, jump up and to the far right, there's another invisible platform against the wall.  Once you're against the wall, just keep jumping up until you get to the secret door!  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Level Select[CR]Inside the door there are several chests with gold and silver and all kinds of potions, several power stars, and 7 more doors.  The doors will take you to the different levels of the game.  The first door takes you to level 2, the second to level 3, etc...",

This triggers a self destruct sequence in the level giving the player limited time to retrace their steps back to the entrance before the node explodes.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]On the 29 of December 2049, an Earth Moon base known as Yaz 67 is destroyed by an unidentified Alien battle cruiser. Earth Federation Starfleet Command (EFDC) responds by sending two ofThe Alien Battle Cruiser[CR]their own battle cruisers in an attempt to disable it. The boarding party finds upon entering the ship that instead of an organic crew it is manned by robots, some of which are pre programmedkilling machines. Eventually the boarding party is completely destroyed by these machines. Earth Federation defense force (EFDF) decides that boarding the ship is not an option and so instead tows the Alien cruiser back to Earth until it\u2019s robot protectors can be disabled by electromagnetic fields. Upon completion of this it is found that the Aliens plan to send a fleet of these carriers each containing thousands of robots. The troop\u2019s transporters cannot be destroyed via conventional weapons and instead must be boarded and destroyed from within. The player is drafted as an Elite Trooper, after weeks of training within environments that will simulate the challenge ahead you are deemed worthy. On the 7 of February 2050 EFDS detects that the troop transporters have entered the Solar System and are heading for Earth. On the 8 of February 2050 your brain is implanted with a Battle Frenzy Chip (BFC) that will give you lightning reflexes, superhuman strength and the desire to kill. On the 12 of February 2050 you and 11 other Elite Troopers board the largest Alien transporter and the battle begins.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]RB101 Ricochet Bullet Deflector[CR]Fires high energy bolts that while slow moving are capable of bouncing off walls and inflicting very heavy damage.Lock-on Zero One[CR]Fires moderately fast bolts in rapid succession that will lock on to any enemies standing within direct line of sight of the player; however it drains ammunition very quickly.MTX225 Plasma Mortar Assault Cannon[CR]Fires very slow but very powerful rockets that can eliminate any medium sized enemy in only two hits. Also inflicts splash damage on nearby targets.40-40 Semi-Automatic Rapid Pulse Rifle[CR]The fastest firing weapon in the game. The bolts inflict little damage but are so high in number that it can make quick work of any enemies.TRIBOLT[CR]Fires three bolts, a central bolt with 2 slower bolts either side of it. The spray effect allows for poorer accuracy and can hit three enemies simultaneously. While it has relatively small power the ammo drain is very low despite its spray effect.WEPONEX Hi-Charge Matter Independent Combat Launcher[CR]Also known as \u201cThe Piercer\u201d, it fires a single slow moving but extremely powerful bolt that can pierce through walls and shields. The games maze like design makes this very handy for eliminating enemies taking cover around corners.GRENNA-KIL Pump Action Grenade Propulsion Unit[CR]Fires high explosive grenades in a parabolic arc in front of the player. Direct hits will instantly eliminate all but the toughest enemies and high levels of splash damage can critically injure enemies close by.MTX 9X1: User Controlled Shrapnel Grenade[CR]Also known as \u201cThe Breaker\u201d, this weapon fires a disk directly in front of the player which can be remote detonated releasing seven powerful shells in an arc. Tricky to use but when mastered can destroy multiple high level targets in a single shot.\u201cKing Hell\u201d MegaFluxll Local Fusion Reactor[CR]Extremely rare and powerful weapon. Will only be found once per level and fires a single but massively powerful shot that can destroy any target on a single hit.60-60 Wide Area Cover Plasma Rifle[CR]Similar to the 40-40, this fires in an arc but displays the same ammo drain. As such it can eliminate medium range enemies very quickly.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Sentry[CR]Basic foot droid. Comes in four varieties, these are found in high numbers in each level and will attack en masse to compensate for their little power and durability.Stroller[CR]Similar to the sentry but more powerful and highly durable. It requires a great deal of damage to be destroyed and present a much greater threat to the player throughout the majority of the game.Beast[CR]Eight foot tall mutant electro beast. It carries an indestructible shield that can only be defeated by grenades or piercer bolts. Careful timing required with other weapons to only fire when he lowers his shield to attack.Plasma Man[CR]A very rare, fire-based creature that has the ability to transcend matter. Presents a high challenge to destroy.Tatbot[CR]Very large and slow robot that requires enormous amounts of damage to destroy. Some carry grenades and all posses a high degree of accuracy with their weapons. Players are recommended to use grenades when fighting these behemoths.Bborg[CR]Floating head creature from another dimension. Very fast moving and is formed via a mixture of biological and mechanical technologies. Bears close resemblance to cacodemons from the Doom series of games.Wirehead[CR]Similar to the Bborg but possesses a fully formed body. Each of its limbs in turn must be destroyed before it will fall. Very rare enemy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle Frenzy Cheats[CR]Pause the game, and press one of the following button sequences.

In the game, the player takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, who must stop the vampire Dracula. Versions of the game were released for a multitude of platforms ranging from the Amiga and NES to the Sega CD and PC.[CR]There were numerous variations between each version, though they all played similarly and shared the protagonist Jonathan Harker.NES, Game Boy, Game Gear and Sega Master System[CR]The 8-bit and portable versions of the game skewed closer to standard platformers than the other console versions, with floating platforms and other standard platformer obstacles.SNES and Genesis[CR]The 16-bit versions were action games that focused more on combat and adventure game elements than platforming. The sprite used for Harker was larger, and the games had more enemies to face down.Sega CD and Amiga[CR]Similar to the SNES and Genesis, these versions were more action-oriented. They included FMV cutscenes from the movie and digitized backgrounds.DOS[CR]The Bram Stoker's Dracula for PC MS-DOS systems was a first-person shooter, taking after games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (or Blood and Heretic, which share similar gothic horror settings).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain Health and 99 Lives[CR]At the ''Beware'' screen, press A, Left, U, C, A, Right, Down.

If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.[CR]Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case).

This pun-filled game stars an anthropomorphic wise-cracking bobcat named Bubsy, as he tries to stop enemy aliens (called Woolies) from stealing Earth's supply of yarn balls.[CR]The game later spawned a series of platformers (ending with Bubsy 3D). An enhanced version for the PC, titled Super Bubsy, was released in 1995. Super Bubsy contained upscaled graphics, new sound effects, and the unsuccessful pilot episode for the Bubsy animated series.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like a traditional 2D sidescrolling platformer similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. Players run through levels, attempting to reach the end of the level (before the time runs out) while eliminating enemies, gaining score, collecting powerups, and avoiding deadly obstacles. The game includes fifteen main levels (called \"chapters\") split up into six main areas (ranging from forests to the Wild West) and one final level (set in space).[CR]Bubsy has two abilities at his disposal: jumping (by pressing the Jump button) and gliding (by pressing the Glide button). Gliding reduces his downward falling speed, and activating it at the right time before bouncing up allows Bubsy to be propelled much higher than usual.[CR]Running into enemies, touching deadly obstacles (such as water, spiked pits), and fall damage can kill Bubsy in one hit (as he has no health system whatsoever). However, jumping or gliding onto enemies can eliminate them (getting them out of Bubsy's way while giving the player score). Due to the difficulty, there are plenty of checkpoints (for Bubsy to respawn at) and extra lives (as if starting with nine lives, like the cat mythology, is easy enough) scattered around levels.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Enter the following at the title screen on Control Pad 2, A, Left, A, Up, Down, Down, Down, Left, A, Right, Right, B, Up, B.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday is based on TSR's Buck Rogers XXVC setting created in the late eighties and based on the character whose exploits had been seen in nearly every medium and through several revivals since his debut in 1928. In this adventure, players must help Buck Rogers uncover and destroy a doomsday weapon that could spell the end of resistance to the empire that holds Earth within its grasp.[CR]SSI adapted the Buck Rogers setting (another TSR property using the same rules) using the Gold Box Engine that they had pioneered with its work within the Forgotten Realms campaign setting via such titles as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds.[CR]Based as it was on the \"Gold Box Engine\", players interfaced with the game via a grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. Party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]The console variant of the game eschewed the 3D exploration interface in favor of an isometric view instead, although the tactical combat view was still included.[CR]The game is a sci-fi role player, although it uses the same rules as AD&D (which was the case with its tabletop original). Classes and weapons are analogous to certain aspects of the system, but it is firmly rooted within its high-tech setting.[CR]The packaging, as was typical of SSI's attention to detail as exemplified by their treatment of the Gold Box series of games, took this opportunity to immerse the player within the fiction of its world via an included booklet outlining its history and systems.[CR]Included were:The Rule Book (manual)A logbook containing the history leading up from 1990 to 2356 (the date the game takes place) and describing the systems that it uses as well as text paragraphs describing different areas of the gameAnd a data card (a quick-start card on how to get started with the game on specific machines)[CR]The main disks of the game could be freely copied, although players would be challenged to find certain words within one of the booklets that the game had come with in order to proceed as a test. This mechanic would also be used in a variety of other games within SSI's RPG lineup.[CR]The logbook doubled as a key part of the game as it contained dialogue, scene descriptions, and maps that it would reference. This technique was also used in several other RPGs such as Wasteland and Dragon Wars. As with those titles, Countdown to Doomsday's paragraphs also contained several red herrings designed to mislead players who chose to read ahead and potentially spoil the story for themselves.[CR]Setting[CR]One of the restrictions of the creative credo governing the franchise is that the realism of Buck Rogers' world had to be based on what could be scientifically plausible and possible - hard science as opposed to more fantastic versions. As a result, the series was focused more on the Solar System and the problems associated with terraforming its planets as well as traveling among them.[CR]As another result, the history of game reflects this within its protagonists. In 1999, the United States and the Soviet Union engage in a final war, exchanging blows via nuclear weapons. As a result of this terrible conflict, conventional warfare is abandoned and the survivors band themselves into large alliances. The Russo-American Mercantile (RAM) forms out of an alliance between what is left of Russia and the United States, for example. The Indo-Asian Consortium (IAC) and the Euro-Bloc Faction (EBF) also form and become the pre-eminent superpowers of the day.[CR]Over the next few centuries, these superpowers form an alliance of their own to expand their efforts into space and colonize the planets. RAM colonizes Mars, the Moon (Luna) is colonized by the EBF, and Venus is colonized by the IAC. Fusion rockets transport men and materials to their destinations throughout the Solar System.[CR]In 2275, RAM revolts against an increasingly oppressive Earth government. Venus signs a nonaggression pact with Mars and ten years of war follow. Battered, broken, and cut off from its colonies, Earth starves allowing RAM's forces to dominate what is left. The colonized worlds continue to grow on their own, developing their own unique socieities thanks to the success of their terraforming efforts. for example, Mercury develops a thriving industry based on mining and solar power.[CR]Humanity has also changed with its expansion into the Solar System. Earth is still home to those now known as the Terrans. Mercury's people have become strong and powerful. The Martians have become prideful with their successes, and the Venusians have focused more on matters of study and of the mind.[CR]However, in the first half of the 25th century, the New Earth Organization is set up by Terrans (Earth natives) that seek to overthrow RAM and restore Earth to its former glory. With the revival of Buck Rogers from cryogenic sleep and with his daring leadership and heroic exploits across the Solar System, NEO manages to thwart RAM's attempts to stop them.[CR]High technology has also enabled the construction of robots and Digital Personalities, programs that emulate human thought and emotion but think at the speed of a computer. Genetic engineering on a vast scale has also created tailored creatures found on specific worlds, each made to fulfill either a specific purpose during terraforming or as part of a new product line. As another example, RAM makes use of Combat Gennies, disposable soldiers bred and equipped to fight their wars.[CR]This is the world that the player will be caught up within as they do their part to stop RAM and its allies.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player's party are new NEO recruits and arrive at Chicagorg (formerly Chicago, but far larger) to undergo their final training when it is attacked by RAM troops. If they manage to fend off the attack and save the base, they join efforts to salvage what is left and discover a RAM ship among the wreckage.[CR]Entering the ship, they discover a RAM science program named Scot.dos who joins them as he wishes to defect to NEO after having enough of RAM. Onboard, they discover a batch of ECGs (Experimental Combat Gennies), genetically enhanced soldiers, and find a way to stop them before they mature and create problems for Earth. Scot.dos tells them that the ECGs were created on an asteroid base which they go to investigate.[CR]At the research facility, they discover other projects that RAM is involved with, one of which happens to be a very powerful, laser-based weapon capable of demolishing entire cities at will. A series of satellite reflectors are also being used as a part of its aiming system, and the party is able to destroy these before heading out to Mars where the weapon is located and a test is scheduled.[CR]Unfortunately for them, space pirates under the employ of RAM capture them with the intention of selling them off to their enemies. But Buck Rogers, who has been following a rumor that the pirate leader, Talon, may be employed by RAM, intervenes and helps the party damage the ship to prevent pursuit while they escape.[CR]On Mars, they eventually discover the base where a smaller version of the weapon is being tested and destroy it. They also learn that one of the components for the real weapon is being manufactured on Venus and head there to learn more on what is going on, discovering that the Doomsday Laser is housed on a solar satellite (a Mercurian Mariposa) controlled by a Mercurian noble called the Sun King.[CR]Believing that the party are actually there to help the Sun King take over the Doomsday Laser for himself, the minions of the Sun King let them pass through security. There, the party discovers that the Laser is already targeting Earth and cause a power outage to delay the countdown. After setting it to self destruct and fighting their way from the core of the Mariposa, they manage to escape and watch as the Marisposa explodes taking the Doomsday Laser with it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a party-based RPG using the same engine that SSI had initially built for its Gold Box titles such as Pool of Radiance. As a result, it has many visual cues that make it appear very similar to its more fantastic cousins, but the differences lie mainly within its gameplay conventions.[CR]With the use of more conventional armaments, such as laser guns and plasma throwers, ranged attacks have a greater emphasis in this game. The use of grenades and other explosives are considered key to winning many battles quickly. As it is also space-based, the use of that medium has also opened the door on opportunities to attack and board enemy spaceships, often giving them a great deal of loot to recover and sell if need be.[CR]Limited dialogue with NPCs, puzzles, and the exploration of bases, secret laboratories, caves, and a variety of other venues are also found throughout the game.[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what career a character may be restricted in playing as.Races[CR]There are six races that players can choose from in order to build their party. Four of these are considered \"human\" types while two others are \"gennies\", those that have been bred to include certain other attributes that lie outside of the human gene pool.Terrans - These are unengineered humans. They can be a part of any career path and have no distinct weaknesses with fairly average statistics across the board.Venusians - Venus' civilization is a diverse mix of cultures and are often involved as traders, farmers, or herdsmen. They can also be a part of any career path.Martians - They are the oldest and most advanced civilization in the Solar System having benefited from RAM's continuing work there. Because of the lower gravity on Mars, they are slightly weaker than Terrans but equal to most everyone else. Any career path is open to them.Mercurians - Mercury is ruled by the Sun Kings, those descended from the original owners of the great Mariposa solar satellites that orbit the planet, holding court within their palaces. Three other cultures live on the surface of Mercury, descended from the refugees that had fled the chaos of the rest of the Solar System. They can be a part of any career path.Tinkerers - These were bioengineered with lemurs and gibbons to be able to work in small spaces and maintain machinery. As a result, they are very good with technology, but they are restricted to only to careers: Engineer and Medic.Desert Runners - One of the oldest bioengineered races, they were bred to survive on the harsh surface of Mars during its latter terraforming years. They bear feline features from the genetic stock they were mixed with, can run long distances, and fight with their own claws if need be. They are great fighters and good with their hands which help considering that they are restricted to the Rocketjock, Warrior, and Engineer career paths.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Warriors must have a good Strength score in order to be effective in melee combat.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as with a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as laser rifles, bolt guns, and even their ability to pilot a rocketship without crashing.Constitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. Sheer physical toughness.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a character, especially the leader. Helps with Intimidation and Acting.Intelligence (INT) - This is required for most of the careers in the game and reflects wit and memory. Still prized in the 25th Century.Wisdom (WIS) - Common sense and important to Medics in their practice, Rogues in keeping them from robbing the wrong people, and aids in certain skills.Tech (TCH) - Technical Knowhow that determines a character's affinity for machines and equipment. If a character has a high Tech skill, they have a better grasp on fixing things as well as people.[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are allotted across them as a result. For examples, Desert Runners are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]This game does not use an alignment system. The party is expected to be on the side of \"the good guys\".Careers[CR]Instead of classes, Buck Rogers' uses a system based on careers instead with a series of skills associated with each one.Rocketjocks - They are the pilots of the Solar System, the daredevils that can drive anything as long as it can move.Warriors - These are seasoned fighters dedicated to the arts of combat. Every second level (2nd, 4th, etc..), warriors also earn a specialization bonus to their weapon of choice up to a maximum plus of 3 for each one.Medics - Advanced technology only means that medics can work their miracles even better than before. They can use onboard Medical Centers, cure poison, and otherwise bandage everyone back up.Rogues - No security system can stand in their way for long and they can also stay out of sight when someone comes looking for something they may be missing.Engineers - If it's broken, they can fix it. Not quite as much of a braggart as a Rocketjock, but they're close.Skills[CR]The also uses an extensive skill system based on what career a character has chosen along with a number of general skills that each can also develop, roughly similar to that used in Interplay's post-apocalyptic RPG, Wasteland.[CR]These represent a character's expertise with a particular field. Every new character gets an allotment of points to distribute among their career's skills and every level-up awards them with 40 points to distribute among their abilities. A maximum total of eighty points can be assigned to any one skill which translated as a percentage. Ability skills, such as those under the heading for Dexterity, also benefit from its score.[CR]For example, if the Pick Pocket skill has 20 points allocated to it and the character's Dexterity is 16, the end total for the skill would be 36 which translates into a success percentile of 36%.[CR]One unusual factor to consider is that among the skills offered to the player in this game, not all of them are actually used. The reason behind this is that they have been included in anticipation of the sequel, although this won't prevent a player from putting points into those skills.[CR]Dexterity SkillsAcrobatics - The skill of balanceClimb - The ability to scale over obstacles without equipmentDrive Groundcar - Anything on the ground is fair game. Not used in the game.Drive Jetcar - Ability to use a car powered by jets.

They are, in the order of easiest to hardest:NoviceCadetTrooperVeteranAce[CR]The game is preset at \"Trooper\" difficulty which is considered the average, or median, range of difficulty that is not too hard for newcomers yet not too easy as to present little challenge.[CR]The party-based Gold Box series of RPGs had standardized themselves on the engine that was pioneered with this game for both exploration and combat explaining the similarities between each one. Although each subsequent game would feature tweaks and modifications as a result of further gameplay enhancements, the basic structure and approach within this formula was always the same.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacker shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.Space Combat[CR]With rocket ships and pilots, the game also involves space combat which is handled both from the pilot's perspective and that of the crew's. From the Pilot's Menu, the player can fire its weapons, target specific systems on the enemy ship, ram the enemy vessel, or even board it once they have pummeled it to the point where it can no longer move.This is not in real-time.[CR]During combat, the player can also give orders to the crew to help repair the ship, jury rig systems to get them working again, boost the engines, use sensors to probe the other vessel (thus revealing additional information), or administer aid to those injured.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Budokan: The Martial Spirit is a video game by Electronic Arts, originally released in 1989. The game saw release on multiple platforms, including Amiga, DOS, Sega Genesis, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game starts with the player at the gates of the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo, the training hall headed by Tobiko-Sensei. In order to continue and enter the courtyard, the game requires you to identify a family crest which is displayed on the screen, typical of the copy protection methodology employed by PC games in those days.[CR]The game mechanics are vastly different than what are commonly employed in the 2D fighting game franchises that followed it (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Samurai Shodown, et al). Combat is heavily focused on single strikes from a variety of stances, which you engage and disengage by pressing towards and away, respectively. (Movement is handled with the diagonals, down-towards and down-away.)[CR]Thus, where other games mix up your attacks by employing multiple buttons and mixing in the distance from your opponent, Budokan allows you specific control over whether you strike with (for example) a front kick, side kick, or a reverse roundhouse kick, and whether that kick is aimed at the head, chest or shin, using only the d-pad and a single button. Which strike you use is determined by (a) the stance that you engage to open the attack and (b) the directional button that you end up pressing when you finally press the Strike button. (Blocking is handled similarly, and requires the same amount of attention to precision with regards to high, medium and low.)[CR]Examples:Street Fighter II, Dhalsim's stretch double punch: Stay far away, press Fierce punchStreet Fighter II, Dhalsim's two-hit headbutt: Get in close, press Fierce punchBudokan, Karate side-kick: press away to engage side-kick stance, then press attackBudokan, Karate front-kick: press towards to engage front-kick stance, then press attackBudokan, Karate reverse roundhouse kick: press towards to engage front-kick stance, then press away and attackBudokan, Karate chest punch: press and hold attack to engage punching/blocking stance, then press towardsBudokan, Karate mid-block: press and hold attack to engage punching/blocking stance, then press away[CR]While it offers maximum control and is arguably what makes Budokan unique, the mechanics can also be a bit cumbersome and lead to slower, more plodding matches when compared to the faster-moving 2D fighters of today. There are no physics-defying special moves such as fireball or body launcher attacks.[CR]Below your stamina meter (which recovers slowly over time), there is a \"Ki\" meter that builds up very slowly when you're not attacking, and though it's not really analogous to today's \"Super\" meters, the higher your Ki is when attacking, the harder you strike (after which the Ki empties out). Thus it's entirely possible (though quite difficult) to knock out an adversary in a single strike after defending and withholding attacks long enough to fill up your Ki entirely.Fighting Styles[CR]Throughout the game, you have the ability to choose from four different fighting styles. The following styles are available:Karate: Unarmed martial arts styleKendo: Form of Japanese fencing with use of a wooden swordNunchaku: A weapon consisting of two sticks connected by a chain or ropeBo: A long wooden staffTraining[CR]Once in the courtyard, you can select from five different dojos, all of which allow you to practice individual fighting styles. The available training options are jiyu-renshu (practice), kumite (sparring against instructors), and Budokan (tournament). By entering the dojos, you will enter the training mode and be able to practice your moves.Budokan[CR]Aside from training, you also have the option of entering the tournament at the Budokan. In this tournament, you will face challengers which use fighting styles that are not practiced at the dojo. The player can only choose a single fighting style a maximum of four times. The tournament pits you against twelve different challengers.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]While the game only features one playable character, you do face a variety of challengers in the Budokan tournament, all with their own individual styles and weapons.Goro Suzuki[CR]Dojo: Ozeki-Ryu[CR]Rank: Shodan[CR]Weapon: Karate[CR]Goro is better known for his sushi-eating ability than his karate skill, but don't underestimate him. He's got a good punch and a hefty kick. You'd better stay alert.Eiji Kimura[CR]Dojo: Yagyu-Ryu[CR]Rank: Shodan[CR]Weapon: Kendo[CR]Known around town as the \"kamikaze kid,\" Eiji knows only one thing -- all out offensive fighting. He'll want to take you out early, so watch out for his opening combination.Jimmy Doran[CR]Dojo: Shito-Ryu[CR]Rank: Nidan[CR]Weapon: Tonfa[CR]Jimmy was introduced to karate when his dad was station on Okinawa. He quickly fell in love with the beauty of its form and its spiritual depth. Dedicated and serious, Jimmy is solid karate-ka.Shigeo Kawahara[CR]Dojo: None[CR]Rank: No Rank[CR]Weapon: Nunchaku[CR]Shigeo has spent the last two years on a deserted island striving to perfect his nunchaku technique. Undefeated in local tournaments, he'll crush your spirit if it isn't strong.Tetsuo Okabe[CR]Dojo: Miyate-Ryu[CR]Rank: Sandan[CR]Weapon: Bo[CR]He quit his full-time job as a \"salary man\" to devote his life to the study of budo. Okabe-san's hard and diligent training shows in his strong techniques. Keep your guard up and the pressure on.Arnie Gustafson[CR]Dojo: Hakutsu-Kai[CR]Rank: Godan[CR]Weapon: Karate[CR]Martial arts continue to thrive in Europe as exemplified by Arnie. His strength has earned him top rankings worldwide. His kicks are fast, powerful, and accurate. Respect him.Hiroshi Ikeda[CR]Dojo: Araki-Ryu[CR]Rank: Hachidan[CR]Weapon: Kusari-Gama[CR]\"Mountain Man\" Ikeda lives in a small secluded village high atop Mt. Ueno. Once a year, he travels to Tokyo to compete in the Budokan. Unfortunately for you, he has returned again this year.Miyuki Hirose[CR]Dojo: Shinkage-Ryu[CR]Rank: Yondan[CR]Weapon: Naginata[CR]She started training at age ten and continues to improve and refine her technique. Don't let her delicate appearance fool you - it may be the last mistake you will ever make.Randy Wu[CR]Dojo Sekiguchi-Kai[CR]Rank: Hachidan[CR]Weapon: Nunchaku[CR]Randy started his training in Honolulu but then decided to move to Japan and study under the notorious \"White Tiger,\" Mizukami-Sensei. His style may be rather unorthodox, but it is deadly.Ayako Maruyama[CR]Dojo: Unknown[CR]Rank: Unknown[CR]Weapon: Ninjitsu[CR]People speculate that Ayako studies a very ancient and obscure form of Ninjitsu. Though many argue about its origins, there's no arguing about its effectiveness.Kazuo Sakata[CR]Dojo: Hozo-in[CR]Rank: Shichidan[CR]Weapon: Yari[CR]\"Fight hard, fight fair, and fight with honor!\" are the words that Kazuo lives by. He abides by the strict Bushido code of honor, so mind your etiquette in battle.Tokage[CR]Dojo: Unknown[CR]Rank: Unknown[CR]Weapon: Various[CR]\"Tokage,\" the Chameleon, has the unnerving ability to mimic and copy his opponent's fighting styles.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cadash is a multiplayer action RPG developed by Taito for the Arcades in 1989. The cabinet supported up to two players (though two cabinets could be \"linked\" for four-player), where each player would control one of four classes much like Gauntlet. The game uses a side-scrolling perspective, and characters can become stronger by defeating enemies and leveling up, or finding and purchasing items. There was also a non-linear element to the game, allowing the player to return to past locations with keys they found for additional items.Cadash was also adapted for the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis. The Genesis version reduces the number of characters to choose from to just two, removing the Priestess and Ninja/Rogue. Both console versions allow for two players (using the TurboTap accessory for the TG-16 version). The Arcade version determined the length of time the player could spend on the game with a strict time limit, rather than waiting for the player to game over naturally. As well as by spending more money, this time limit could be extended with special items found in-game, and a special spell that only the Priestess can use.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player, as one of four classes, pass through largely linear 2D side-scrolling stages full of monsters and traps. The game is similar to Nintendo's Zelda II, as it combines a standard platformer/action game with RPG elements; as monsters are defeated, experience is added to the character's meter and they'll eventually level up, gaining more health and doing more damage. Ideally, the player should be leveling up at a rate to match the increased difficulty of the monsters.ClassesThe player can choose from one of four classes (the latter two are unavailable on the Sega Genesis version):Fighter: A burly fighter that takes on monsters at close range and has the highest defense and attack strength as well as the second highest speed. He's disadvantaged against ranged creatures, and needs to purchase a shield to block their attacks.Wizard: A versatile spell-caster that is very slow and weak, but can launch all manner of offensive ranged spells at foes, making him very effective at a distance and especially against bosses. He also levels up the fastest. He is disadvantaged against undead foes, which are inexplicably immune to his magic, forcing him to rely on weak physical attacks with his staff.Priestess: A female spell-caster who focuses on defensive and utilitarian magic. She has a decent range of stats and her protective skills make her an easy character to play as. She's also the only character able to increase the timer in the Arcade version. She is disadvantaged by her limited offensive capabilities, which means she has the most trouble against bosses and other tough creatures.Ninja/Rogue: Called a Ninja in the Arcade version, and a Rogue in the TurboGrafx-16 version, he is the fastest and deadliest character at a range. Unlike the magic-users, he can use his range attacks immediately without selecting it from a menu first, and his damage output and speed makes him very powerful against bosses and most enemies in the game. His disadvantage is that he takes the longest to level up, making him less effective in the mid-game as the other characters edge ahead in health and other stats.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Free Play[CR]When \"Press start button\" is displayed on the title screen, press up, down, C, A, left, right, B, C.  If entered correctly, a sound effect will play.  The game is now set to Free Play.",

In most versions of the game, the player chose to compete in individual events or an event series. Unlike Epyx previous games, in which players chose a nationality, players get to choose a sponsor. The Commodore 64, for example, includes Maxx-Out, Costa Del Mar, Kawasaki, Santa Cruz, Ocean Pacific, Casio, Auzzie, Spin Jammer, and Ray-D-O, while the NES release adds publisher Milton Bradley to the roster.As a multi-platform game, the visual fidelity of California Games really depends on the machine that is powering it. In general, the art style was heavily informed by Californian imagery. The footbag event has the Golden Gate Bridge as a backdrop. On other platforms where space was at a premium, events were sacrificed. The Atari Lynx and 2600 releases only included four of the events: BMX, surfing, footbag, and halfpipe.Each event featured a different soundtrack, including some renditions of well known hits. Richard Berry's song \"Louie Louie\" accompanies the titles, while The Safari's hit \"Wipe Out\" sounds out during the surfing event.[CR]Events[CR]SurfingSet under a crashing pipeline wave, players gain speed to do aerial tricks and avoid falling off their board. Most versions of the game rate the player on a 10.0 scale, though some give points to the number of rotations in an aerial trick.HalfpipePlayers are given a time limit in which to earn points for rotation and hand plant tricks in a skateboarding half pipe. Not only must they execute these tricks, but they must turn their board in time to descend the ramp and keep momentum into the next trick.Flying DiskThis event requires throwing a frisbee to a partner off the screen. Players time their button presses to a meter to execute angle and speed and, once released, gain control of the offscreen player the catch the flying disk. Points are earned for successful catches.BMXPlayers ride along a dirt track with ramps and obstacles, doing wheelies, flips and spins to earn points. They are also judge on the time it takes to reach the goal, which can be impeded by falling off the bike or crashing.FootbagJuggling a hackysack with feet, head, and body, players must keep the bag from touching the ground while doing fancy moves to earn more points. Players can hit seagulls with the bag for bonus points.Roller SkatingPlayers skate along a path running parallel to the beach, doing tricks and spins while avoiding obstacles on the sidewalk.[CR]",

They both make use of reflex-based puzzle solving with some later levels requiring a high level of dexterity and good timing to complete. The games use a darkly-humorous anti-war theme, reflected in the theme song \"War Has Never Been So Much Fun\" (which had lyrics in the Amiga versions of the game) and in the pre-mission screen where a queue of recruits line up in front of a hill scattered with gravestones - one for each soldier lost during the course of the game. Each soldier is uniquely-named (some after the developers), standing in contrast to the \"fodder\" in the game's title.[CR]The player is able to split the initial squad of soldiers into smaller groups and switch between the groups. Squads are armed with guns (primary fire) and with a limited number of grenades and rockets to destroy enemy buildings and vehicles. Missions are usually along the lines of \"Destroy Enemy Buildings\" or \"Kill All Enemies\". Some missions take place over a number of phases and different locales such as Jungle, Snow and Desert areas.[CR]War Has Never Been So Much Fun[CR]...the game's tagline and opening lyric for the game's theme tune.

This is also the first Castlevania game to refer to the Vampire Killer whip by it's name. The game is also known for its attempt to connect the Castlevania franchise to Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula (even by referring to the father of the game's protagonist as Quincy Morris, the name of a key character in the novel).[CR]Castlevania: Bloodlines is also known for being the precursor to Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, in which the player plays as John's son, Jonathan Morris. Eric Lecarde also plays a prominent role in the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Castlevania: Bloodlines plays like a traditional Castlevania platformer. Players guide either John or Eric through six stages spread throughout Europe, increasing their score by defeating enemies and collecting bags of money (dropped by enemies or destroying scenery). Players will also find jewels (which serve as ammunition for sub-weapons and super \"Item Crash\" attacks), the \"Mirrors of Truth\" (which clears the screen of all enemies), black orbs (which grant the player temporary invulnerability), Coat of Arms (which upgrades the player's primary weapon), mutton chops (which restroes some of the player's health), and 1-Up items (which grant the player an extra life). Each stage is linear (with the exception of certain parts that must be completed with a specific character). Along with one boss to close the level, each stage also features one or more mini-bosses.Character Differences[CR]Castlevania: Bloodlines allows the player to pick one of two playable characters, each with their own unique primary weapon and special attributes.[CR]John Morris utilizes the legendary Vampire Killer whip, which can be charged by holding down the attack button. Like Simon Belmont from Super Castlevania IV, John can use his whip to swing from special blocks, allowing him to easily pass certain chasms. Although he can only attack horizontally on the ground, he can whip diagonally and under him while in the air.[CR]Eric Lecarde wields the Alcarde Spear, a long spear that allows him to stab at enemies in multiple directions. When jumping out of a crouch, Eric uses his spear to propel himself into the air, allowing him to reach new heights while attacking airborne enemies.[CR] Sub-Weapons/Item Crushes[CR]Along the way, John and Eric can pick up sub-weapons that consume jewels for a special attack (which, unlike most early Castlevania games, is given its own attack button).BoomerangBattle AxeSacred Water[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Music With Final Upgrades[CR]Enter the options menu.

[CR]Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. [CR]One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. [CR]Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. [CR]When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight. [CR]When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. [CR]Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]To start the game at one of the most powerful levels, with 11 consular legions and 35,000 talents: [CR][B]TAGY-V6P5-QAAA-AH3K-VKVA-MIES[/B] [CR]To Rule the Empire: [CR][B]QDUA-YQ25-5555-55NK-VKXW-IPJI[/B]",

Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.[CR]The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.",

If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.[CR]All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. [CR]There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:[CR]1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.[CR]2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:[CR]1. 14.1 Challenge  After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.[CR]2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.[CR]3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.[CR]4. Equal Offence  Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.[CR]5. Three Pool  Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.[CR]6. Speed Pool  Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).[CR]3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:[CR]1. Eight Ball (2 Players)   A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.[CR]7. Nine Ball (2-8 Players)   A standard nine ball game with up to 8 players taking turns. First player to get the 9-ball in wins.[CR]8. 14.1 Continuous (2 Players)   Players can hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is missed then other player plays. If there is only one ball on the table the pocketed balls are re-racked. Play continues until one of the players reaches the score chosen at the start of the game.[CR]9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.[CR]10. Rotation (2-8 Players)   Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.[CR]11. Straight Pool (2 Players)    Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.[CR]12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)    Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.[CR]13. Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Rotation except that any ball can be hit not just the lowest.[CR]14. One Pocket (2 Players)   The two players are given one of the two pockets at the end of the table. The player must hit all the balls in there nominated pocket with the one with the most balls wins.[CR]Three Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Three Ball in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.[CR]15. Speed Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Speed Ball in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.[CR]4.

Still, any bundle of joy is not without its poo, and the game has plenty of that, too. And so I ask: does the poo outweigh the good? Well, no.

The number of laps varies, as does the shape of a given course, but there are typically somewhere around three laps and there are only around six different course patterns.[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/console/genesis/review/R72364.html[CR]",

If you catch up with the criminal's vehicle, you can ram into it to do some damage. If you do enough damage, the car malfunctions and you arrest the suspect. You can also use up to three turbo boosters that comes equipped with the car if you are far behind the suspect.[CR]However, what makes this game different is the fact that you can choose one of three vehicles to drive: a sports car, 4-wheel drive, and a semi truck, with each one of them having their advantages and disadvantages. For example, the truck may be slow in speed, but can do a massive amount of damage. The sports car, on the other hand, can perform at higher speeds, but has a poor attack efficiency. As well as passing cars, your task is made difficult by obstacles, such as barricades, on the freeway. Finally, some vehicles in the game will have someone shooting at you.

Chester Cheetah   orders a motorcycle from a  catalogue to help him escape from the zoo, but Mean Eugene intercepts  the package and hides the parts around the zoo. With the help of his  friends, The Hip-O and Funky Monkey, Chester must find the parts to his  motorcycle so he can \"ditch this zoo and ride away to Hip City, USA.\"  Too Cool to Fool's illustrious cast of characters. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is a fairly straightforward platformer with the only actions available to the player being walk, run and jump. Enemies are dazed (occasionally killed) by being jumped on. Extra lives are gained by collecting one hundred Paw Badges. The factor that differentiates Too Cool to Fool from other platformers is the objective of having to find a motorcycle part in each level. The player can find the exit to each level, but they can't use it until they have found the motorcycle part. [CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are five stages in Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool each with a different theme and different enemies.Stage 1: Four Corners Zoo Park  My God it's full of sewers!  This stage starts with Chester chilling on a bench when Mean Eugene and Grunt, his dog, run by with a box full of Chester's motorcycle parts. Chester leaps off the bench and hops into action. This appears to be an entirely flat plane with a few areaa, but the majority of it takes place underground in a maze of sewer pipes. Stage 2: Monkey Pits This stage has a jungle theme and is a fairly vertical level with lots of vines and trees to climb. Funky Monkey helps Chester in this level by jumping on enemies and retrieving the motorcycle from a branch that Chester can't reach.Stage 3: Gator Alley A very horizontal level taking place over water that is filled with enemies and areas where Chester will fall into the water. The Hip-O helps Chester by acting as a moving platform so he can cross some water. There is a lengthy boat section where Chester must avoid Mean Eugene's boat and some logs.Stage 4: Hidden CavesA cave stage filled with bats and boulder punching pigs. This level has many pitfalls that will cause the player to be looped back to the beginning of the stage. It also has a lengthy   mine cart sequence that, like the boat section in the previous level, involves dodging Mean Eugene. Stage 5: Bird HouseThe first seconds of this level take place on a jungle canopy but as soon as you can say \"Dangerously Cheesy\" Chester is launched onto the back of a large butterfly-like creature and the beginning of an incredibly long flying sequence begins. Mean Eugene attacks in a helicopter with rockets, but is finally defeated for good and Chester grabs the final part of his motorcycle.  [CR] Power-ups[CR]There are a number of items that can be grabbed that help Chester in his muffler-hunting quest.Cheetah Paw: This health restoring item resembles one of the cheeto paw snakes that were in production in the early nineties. This is surprisingly the only possible reference to cheetos in the game.Sunglasses: Although Chester is always wearing sunglasses, he can grab this additional pair to turn the screen monochrome and reveal hidden badges.Guitar: This guitar will make Chester invulnerable as he rocks out. The problem with this item is that it relinquishes control from the player as Chester stands in one spot and takes a few hops to the left and right. In one stage grabbing the guitar will cause Chester to jump off the platform he is on and get damaged by water. Sneakers: These give Chester the ability to dash by holding down a button. When dashing Chester can jump a considerable distance. Until the Chester gets these he can only walk at a pace that should make him ashamed to call himself a cheetah. Skateboards: The skateboard will bring Chester to the bonus stage. In the bonus stage Chester rides the motor powered skateboard to collect as many badges as possible. Paw Badges: The standard    collectible. Get one hundred and get an extra life. [CR]Manual   [CR] Don't walk, run! To buy some Cheetos brand corn snacks!     Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool comes with a gem of a manual. Not only is it filled with      Engrish, but the writers have attempted to have every line rhyme. This leads to sentences  such as \"Good gain by swipin' the motorcycle frame!\" and \"If you're hip and brave enough, check out these Hidden Caves and stuff.\"The manual also has a coupon for 50 cents off a bag of paw shaped Cheetos. The coupon expires 12/31/93.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Kakusi Mode[CR]At the title screen, press up, A, B, C, right, A, B, C, down, A, B, C, left, A, B, C. If entered correctly, a sound effect plays. Now, enter the Option screen. A menu will appear with a stage select, sound test, and settings for the amount of lives and credits to start with.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild West is the second of two games for the Super Nintendo and Genesis based on the radical feline Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah. Like the first, Too Cool to Fool, Wild Wild West is a side-scrolling platformer that pits Chester Cheetah against his old nemesis Mean Eugene the zookeeper as well as various other less-than-cool humans and animals. He can collect one-use items that will help him survive, and the player can determine which stage he visits next via a map of the USA.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Well, it finally happened. Chester Cheetah escaped captivity at the zoo and was cruising down the road on his awesome motorcycle following his map to Hip City. Suddenly, Mean Eugene stole his map, ripped it to pieces, and scattered them across the United States. He needs to recover all the pieces by travelling the breadth of the continent, avoiding Mean Eugene all the while. Because, after all...it's not easy being cheesy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Chester on the way to 7-Eleven for some Cheetos[CR]The gameplay in Wild Wild Quest is fairly different than its prequel. The mechanics and sprites are completely redone and, in most cases, of much higher quality. For example, the artists went through the trouble to put shading on things.[CR]Now that he's out of the zoo Chester has decided to add a bit of pep to his walk and goes at about twice the speed that he did in Too Cool to Fool. Chester can also dash without the need for a power-up and perform super jumps. Chester is a fragile kitty though and will die after one hit if he isn't carrying a bag of Cheetos Brand Crunchy Cheese Flavored Snacks.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Levels are selected from a level select screen modeled on a US map. The player chooses a starting level and from there can choose from the level to the left or right of the level they just played.[CR]In each level Chester must find the map piece before the timer runs out. Once the map piece is found Chester has to find his way to the \"GOAL\" sign at the end of the level. Each level has a bizarre boss fight after the player reaches the goal.Euphreaka: Located in Northern California this beachy level is filled with palm trees, vultures and a very angry fat beach lady.Quakers-Field: This Californian town is filled with orchards, junked cars and buildings of questionable sturdiness.Omahog: A farm level based in Nebraska.Lostin: This town in Massachusetts is filled to the brim with water, pirates and ships.Numb: Chester makes his way up north to Alaska to slide around on the ice and enjoy the auroras.Wall Up: New Mexico's finest sombrero'd cacti watch as Chester runs through this desert.Little Shock: Chester must navigate his way through this power plant in the heart of Arkansas.Un-Clearwater: Will Florida's swamps thwart Chester's need for a map piece?Not-So-Great-Falls: Lots of hyphens don't keep this mountainous Montana level down.Rally: Once Chester gets all of the map pieces he makes his way to North Carolina to beat Mean Eugene in a NASCAR race. This is less of a level and more of a final boss stage.[CR]Collectibles[CR]It's almost like this game is an ad for Cheetos or something...Cheeto Paw: Levels are filled with Cheeto paws of all sizes. Although they are counted, they don't give you any extra lives, just lots of points.Bag of Cheetos: Unlike Too Cool to Fool, this game actually contains Cheetos. If Chester is carrying a bag of these he won't die when he gets hit by an enemy.Map Piece: One in each level, Chester needs this to finish a level.Friend Icon: There are several icons in each level representing one of Chester's animal friends. They give you points.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores 6,9,8,8 stating, \"...Great animations, especially the guitar playing, along with a decent quest and a lot of different levels to keep the game rockin'. A definite winner\".[CR]",

He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally.

The game was known as Probotector in PAL regions, and was known as Contra: The Hard Corps in Japan. The \"Hard Corps\" in the title is a pun on the word \"hardcore,\" which makes sense, as the game is believed to be one of the most difficult Contra games.[CR]There are various differences between the different releases of the game. The Japanese version is notable because it grants the player with a life bar, allowing the player to get hit a total of three times before death, rather than once in the North American version.

Later in the game, the infiltration is revealed to be lead by Colonel Bahamut, who was involved in the Alien Wars. He is attempting at world domination by trying to capture an alien cell that is stored in the defense complex.[CR]After this, the story can branch out into many paths.

Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.[CR]Arashi o Yobu Enji (\"A Kindergartner Called Tempest\") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.[CR]Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.",

If you love Motley Crue, that's not the reason to play this game. Play this game for love of pin ball games.[CR]The sound effects are pretty good and there is a good variety of them. There's also plenty of different kinds of targets to hit. If you're bored with it, it's likely because you haven't figured out the right things to hit to bring out new enemies.[CR]As pin ball games go, this one is pretty good. It's not as flashy and elaborate as Dragon's Fury, but it's still fun to play.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Fire the ball with A. The strength of the fire varies with the length of time you hold A. Experiment with different firing strengths. A special amount could win you big points! Operate the right flipper with the C button and the left flipper with any of the directional buttons.[CR]To tilt (which meant to literally tilt the table in a real pinball game, but is simulated in this one) press B. Use this to give the board a little shake that may just keep your ball from going down the drain. In some games you can tilt too much, but not in this one.[CR]If your ball drops down between the flippers in the bottom section of the screen, it's lost and you'll have to start over with a new one, if you have one. Your score doesn't reset until you run out of all of your balls, but the board resets when one goes down the drain. Next to the flippers at the bottom of the screen are Kickstart lanes. Usually a ball would roll down these and down the drain, but in this game you can press and hold the right flipper button for the left lane and the left flipper button for the right lane and, instead, your ball will be fired up and out of it. Keep in mind that the flipper on the opposite side from the lane you want to activate is the one you want to use.[CR]In the center of the table, knock out all of the letters to spell \"ROCK\" and \"ROLL\" and the center diamond will raise up. Now knock out all of the pieces of the diamond. Next knock out the letter tiles that say \"JUMP RAMP\". Now a ramp will appear in the center of the diamond. If you fire the ball straight up it you'll be sent to a bonus round with a different style and layout! The bonus round works more like pong. Bounce the ball at the skeletons that come out of the wall. If you miss the ball or a skeleton gets past you, it will load a bonus ball (if you have any). You could play here infinitely, if you have the skill.[CR]Destroy the three green haired skulls in the center section. Now knock down the tiles that say \"HEAD\" as well as the skull tile on either end. Now knock out the tiles that say \"BANGER\". Now shoot the ball into the top section. A head wearing shades will come out. Destroy the head and you'll get an extra ball. It'll take quite a few hits. In the top of the screen there is a volume knob, but you can't get to it until you break the walls that are in the very center of the top of the screen. The head will float back and forth in front of this wall, making it difficult to break. When you break the wall down, shoot the ball around the knob and it'll say \"Crank it up!\". Now shoot the ball into the door that just opened that has an arrow in front of it.[CR]Keeping knocking down targets, walls, and the dudes that come out on the screen. Figure out the right order and you'll crank the volume up higher and higher (and the points as well). Bring out more and more beasties until you bring out the final one! Destroy him and you win!

Now knock down the tiles that say \"HEAD\" as well as the skull tile on either end. Now knock out the tiles that say \"BANGER\". Now shoot the ball into the top section. A head wearing shades will come out. Destroy the head and you'll get an extra ball. It'll take quite a few hits. In the top of the screen there is a volume knob, but you can't get to it until you break the walls that are in the very center of the top of the screen. The head will float back and forth in front of this wall, making it difficult to break. When you break the wall down, shoot the ball around the knob and it'll say \"Crank it up!\". Now shoot the ball into the door that just opened that has an arrow in front of it.[CR]Keeping knocking down targets, walls, and the dudes that come out on the screen.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts in an action-platforming game originally published in 1988 by Capcom for arcades. The game has since been ported to several home computers and consoles. It is the second entry in the notoriously-difficult Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. Three years after Sir Arthur rescues his true love Princess Prin Prin from the evil Astaroth, Lucifer (or Loki in some versions) brings forth an army of macabre minions and steals the  souls of several helpless victims; among the souls stolen is that of Arthur's beloved. Once again, Arthur dons his trusty armor to fight the demonic hordes and rescue these lost souls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur unleashes Thunder Magic[CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, but with a few notable exceptions. Arguably the most significant addition is Arthur's new ability to fire any weapon vertically up or down. Most of the original game's weapons are present and a few new weapons have been added, as well as a new set of magically-infused Golden Armor. When equipped, the Golden Armor allows Arthur to charge his current weapon to perform a powerful magic attack. Each weapon has its own unique magic, save for the Psycho Cannon.Weapons & Magic Lance - Fires a lance in a straight line. Thunder Magic fires a powerful magic bolt vertically from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right. This weapon is called \"Sword\" in some versions. Sword - A strong melee-only weapon that is swung in a short arc. Thunder Dragon Magic unleashes a flaming dragon upward that attacks sky-bound enemies. This weapon is called \"Super Sword\" in some versions. Axe - Hurls an axe in a straight line. This weapon can penetrate objects, but has a slow rate of fire. Exploding Magic summons several large explosions around Arthur's position.Torch - Lobs a torch in a short arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Fireball Magic creates four fireballs that swirl outward from Arthur's left and right sides. This weapon is called \"Fire Water\" in some versions.Discus - Fires a bladed disc in a straight line which will follow the contour of any platforms on contact. Firing while crouching causes the disc to move along the ground's surface. Mirror Magic creates a temporary protective shield ahead of Arthur's position.Dagger - Fires a dagger in a straight line. This weapon is comparatively weak, but it also has the fastest rate of fire in the game. Double Magic creates an invulnerable shadow clone of Arthur that mimics his movement and attacks for a short time.Psycho Cannon - Only available on the second playthrough. Fires a blast of powerful magic in a straight line for a short distance. This weapon cannot be charged, although its range is increased while wearing the Golden Armor.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts World[CR]The game features five Stages, each of which is split into two areas by a checkpoint.Stage One[CR]The Execution Place, a mass grave at the edge of the Demon Realm, is where Arthur begins his long quest; however, the murderous skeletons, swooping vultures and hair-trigger guillotines located here will attempt to bring his adventure to a very sudden end. This area is also a tribute to the first Stage of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins, complete with remixed music. The Stage's second half at the Floating Island on the Lake features strong winds that slow movement to a crawl. Past the island's poisonous forest, a giant demon known as Shielder protects the exit by spitting fireballs.Stage Two[CR]A constant stream of demonic turtles bounce down the slope leading to the The Village of Decay, a destroyed human settlement. After crossing a gigantic ant lion pit, Arthur is ambushed by an upgraded version of Firebrand known as the Red Arremer King. Further ahead, earthquakes and demonic flames plague the Town of Fire, a sweltering ruin terrorized by the hell-hound Cerberus.Stage Three[CR]Arthur finds himself riding a treacherous elevator up through Baron Rankle's Tower; quick movements are required to avoid being crushed against the ceiling in this auto-scrolling area. At the peak of the Horrible-Faced Mountain, Arthur boldly leaps across the outstretched tongues of several demonic statues before battling a living storm cloud called Gassuto.Stage Four[CR]Giant bones litter the floor of The Crystal Forest, a cave system leading directly into Lucifer's castle. At the halfway point, Arthur descends down the slippery slopes of The Rotting Grotto, stepping across several man-eating plants to land on the back of Ohme, a gigantic immobile worm infested with smaller creatures that collectively act as the Stage boss.Stage Five[CR]If pain was like food, then Lucifer's Castle of Evil Demons would be a feast. The entryway swarms with skeletal dragons and a gauntlet of four Red Arremer Kings as an appetizer. After climbing an ominous spiked ladder, Arthur does battle with Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins. Once Astaroth is dispatched, Arthur is assaulted by two Shielder heads attached to the walls of the next room. Twin Astaroths flank Arthur for a surprise rematch further ahead, followed by a trio of Gassutos. Past one final Shielder head and a legion of demonic insects, Beelzebub guards the Stage exit.[CR]After completing this Stage, Arthur receives a message that he cannot defeat Lucifer without the Psycho Cannon, a weapon blessed by the goddess of battle. In the series' tradition, Arthur is sent back to the first Stage, where players must complete the full game a second time. While wearing the Golden Armor, players can discover the Psycho Cannon in certain treasure chests on the second playthrough.Final Boss: Lucifer[CR]The enormous Lord of Hell sits atop his throne, firing lasers from his mouth and hands and stomping his feet in a last-ditch attempt to exterminate Arthur. However, his evil strength is no match for the power of the Psycho Cannon, which Arthur uses to destroy Lucifer once and for all before reuniting with Princess Prin Prin.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode[CR]At the title screen, while the words are flashing \"Press Start Button\", input \"A, A, A, A, Up, Down, Left, Right\" and you should hear a chime.

                "title_clean": "Dark Castle",
                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dark Castle is the first game in the    Dark Castle series, and was released in 1986 for the   Macintosh. It was one of the first computer (or video) games to use fully recorded samples for      voices and sound effects, and although they were small in number the corresponding effects for yammering      mutants and dizzy  Prince Duncan were quite remarkable, especially when combined with the detailed backgrounds.The game starts with you - as Prince Duncan - entering the Black Knight's castle and the gate slams shuts behind you. In order to escape, you have to trek through      caves, dungeons, and a tower surrounded by perpetual lightning clouds before you're well equipped enough to take on the Black Knight himself.The game uses a WASD control scheme, lets you duck with Q and jump with the spacebar and aim and throw rocks with the mouse. There was a later Sega Genesis version that featured colour, but the horrific controls implemented for rock throwing almost made the game unplayable due to lack of accuracy. [CR]The Levels[CR] Great Hall Great HallOnce inside the castle you're presented with four exits - two doors on the left, a main double-door in the center and a narrow staircase up on the right side. Each is accessed by tapping the corresponding number key.The first two doors are arguably the most frustrating aspect of Dark Castle, since they're random. You have a 50% chance of exiting the side of the castle and embarking on your brief journey to earn      fireballs, and a 50% chance of getting throw down to the dungeon. DungeonUnfortunately, if you end up in the dungeon, the door locks behind you and you must trek through three screens, get the key, and trek back again, and you're no further ahead (alternatively you could just cheat and restart your game). Final area of dungeon (or first, if you fall in)You also end up in the dungeon if you fall into any of the game's pits - they are far fewer in number than in the original, though, as there are only two or three screens (of more than a dozen) that lead to the dungeon. Once there, you must      sneak up on the      torturer, whack him in the back of the head with a morning star, then leap over his unconcious body and grab the correct key before leaping back again. Time it wrong, grab the wrong key, or take too long and allow him to wake up again, and you're dead. Even if you do earn the key, you have to rock-throw, jump, and run your way back to the main hall again, resulting in an awful lot of painstaking      backtracking (in other words, don't fall in pits if you can help it).  Outer CastleIf you do get the correct door, you get to cross a small plain guarded by rock-throwing, gurgling mutants that constantly respawn and      climb three sets of ropes (allowing you to swap between them to avoid mutants climbing down at you). The following room has a number of moving platforms, requiring very careful jumping. It's the first area where use of the games' different jumps becomes essential - Prince Duncan jumps higher, lower, or longer depending on the direction you hold while tapping jump, and he cannot fall like      Mario. Falling more than twice his height will almost always result in death.Once past the platforming segment there is  a brief river rapids through dank tunnels and finally you meet up with the reclusive      wizard, who will gently anoint you with the gift of fireballs, allowing you to throw them instead of regular rocks. Of course, if you reach him without first obtaining the shield from the lightning tower, his magic spell will instead char you to a crisp. Lightning TowerThe left stairwell doesn't take you directly to the tower - where would be the challenge in that? Instead, the first room is a vague homage to      Donkey Kong, with rocks bouncing back and forth, descending level by level. Since Prince Duncan moves like the      Prince of Persia (that is to say, a bit more deliberate than your average Mario-esque platforming mascot) the best route is simply to sneak up ladder by ladder, pausing midway through for the next rock to bounce past. It is possible to duck under or jump over rocks, but this requires an awful lot of skill and patience.Getting hit by a rock while jumping or climbing near the left side of the level won't kill you like it will anywhere else - it'll send you down to the dungeon.The second screen pits you against divebombing vultures (all pattern based) and a firebreathing      dragon. Since your rocks are completely ineffective against the dragon, you have to climb the stairs and jump to the platform above him, dumping the pot of hot oil on his head in order to make him retreat back inside the tower.After hurrying into the hole left by the dragon, Duncan must navigate along a series of ropes and poles. The poles are distinguished by their solid colouring and are a very bad idea - shuffling over to a pole instead of a rope results in you slipping, which send you not to your death but, yes, the dungeon.The final portion of your task involves leaping diagonally up a series of disappearing platforms, which change in such a way that you must zigzag your way up and down and sideways in order to make it to the very top without dizzying yourself or cracking your skull open on the hard stone floor. The top of the room is the top of the tower itself, with a moving thundercloud that occasionally fires out a bolt of lightning. Avoiding that and grabbing the shield at the end will cause the cloud to home in on you, and you must activate the shield just before it zaps, warping you back to the great hall. Black Knight's SanctuaryThe double-doors in the center lead you to the Black Knight. It should be noted that the game never explicitly states that you need the shield and fireballs to complete the game, but it is physically impossible to navigate the rope/platform maze in the first room before you hear a loud barking/whooping noise.That noise is the gargoyle, who is immune to regular rocks and will fly over to you (wherever you are), pick you up, and toss you into the pit to the dungeon. The only way to kill him is to have the fireball upgrade, and that's the only way you're finishing that level.Once navigated past that you'll end up against the Black Knight himself, who sits in his throne in the middle of the room. There are four switches in each corner of the area that must be pulled in order to defeat him, and as you run and climb he'll toss beer mugs at you. These can be avoided, but it's much easier to just tap the shield button as they fly through you. It's a bit anticlimatic, but once all the switches are pulled, you complete the game and your high score is recorded on the main menu. [CR]The Enemies[CR] Enemies of Dark CastleThere are not many enemies in Dark Castle, but the ones that are present are quite distinct from one another.Altering the difficulty on the main menu changes the level completion bonuses you earn as well as the placement and number of enemies - it also affects how long certain enemies stay stunned when hit by your rocks. Needless to say, there will be many more (and less forgiving) enemies on advanced difficulty as opposed to beginner.  BatBats are probably the most common enemy in the game other than rats. When you enter a level they will be curled up at a particular point, sleeping, and will not awake for about five seconds. You can use that time to hit them from afar and smile to yourself as their lifeless corpse plummets to the ground with a splat, or you can wait for them to wake up and take advantage of a closer target as they fly towards you. They have no real pattern other than a general desire to fly straight towards you and kill you, which is a reasonable urge given Duncan's proficiency with rocks. RatRats are very uninteresting - they cannot kill you instantly, however, so you can touch one ever so briefly while running fast. Just don't linger, or they'll turn you stone cold dead. They have no pattern and simply wander back and forth on whatever ledge or floor they're on. Killing one starts a hidden timer, and after a while a new rat pops out of the appropriate rat hole and charges forth, so time the kills and your dashes well. GuardThe guards wander back and forth in much the same way as the rats - they're just bigger, invincible, and carry crossbows. The guards will only fire when facing you and while you're on the same level as them, although their crossbow bolts are subject to gravity and will lose a bit of altitude if you're all the way on the other side of the screen. Hitting them with a rock will make a thunderous tin can noise and knock them unconscious for about ten seconds, giving you time to sneak past. If you have fireballs, of course, you can kill them outright. Guards are only found in the dungeon. MutantMutants can throw rocks - not well, but they can throw rocks. They have a single, grotesque eyeball in the center of their bodies, massive hands, and yammer and gurgle unintelligibly while waving their arms and smacking their bottoms at you. Occasionally they stop this display in order to hurl a rock in your general direction. Mutants can also descend ropes, and (like rats) will respawn shortly after being killed, up to whatever number of mutants are supposed to be in a particular group. Burning EyeThe burning eye is a gigantic floating eyeball that is, well, on fire. It slowly glides in your direction and only stops when you hit it with a rock. Your reprieve is only temporary, however, and you'll have to stop your platforming occasionally in order to stun the eye before it gets too close to you. Of course, if you're lucky enough to have them, fireballs will drop the eye for good.  [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]If you load Dark Castle when your system clock is set to Halloween (October 31st), a number of the enemies will be altered to fit the Halloween theme, such as pumpkin heads and candy. Similarly, when you set the system clock to Christmas (December 25), there is a Christmas tree in the foyer. The game also responds to setting the system clock to any Friday the 13th.The game also replaces the tilde (~) key with a castle icon, which you can use when entering high scores.Dark Castle for the Mac required a very specific (and streamlined) version of the Macintosh 7 operating system, requiring a boot diskette even for Macs with an internal hard drive. However, even with the game files and OS on the same disk it fit on a regular single density 3.5\" floppy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Pause the game and press B, C, A, Up, Start, A, A. New options should unlock allowing infinite lives, keys, shield, fireballs, rocks and elixir. And also a level select.",

The races take place in a side scrolling fashion, their are also minigames that appear every couple of levels where the characters compete in another not racing event such as seeing who can knock out the most gophers in a limited amount of time.

The game's realism also demands greater accuracy from the player, with them having to choose the right moment to serve the ball and return volleys.[CR]The single-player mode has a selection of fictional seeded tennis players to compete against on grass, clay or hard courts in single matches or in tournaments. There is also a two-player mode available for both console versions. Regardless of how many human players are playing, the serving player is always in the foreground with the receiving player in the far background.[CR]",

It uses a lower-than-normal perspective to depict the tennis court, with the camera a few feet above the ground behind the player character. The Genesis version uses software scaling to change the angle of the court if the player moves far enough to the left or right.[CR]The game has multiple modes, including doubles and a tournament mode as well as the Davis Cup itself, and each of the playable characters represents an international team. Though the athletes are only known by their first names for licensing reasons, it's clear enough from examples like \"Jimmy\" (who represents the USA) who they are meant to be.[CR]The game was released on the TurboGrafx-16 exclusively in the US in 1991, developed by Loriciel and published by NEC directly. A TurboGrafx-CD version of the game was released the following year, but only in Japan.

To take them out, Jade needs to choose the most effective weapons and target specific parts before he runs out of time and ammo. Weapons include missiles, rockets, grenades that slow the opponent down, a machine gun and more. Only three weapons can be acquired at all times.

John Spartan is the countrys most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.[CR]Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.[CR]The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Free lives[CR]Pause the game and press C, A, B, A, Left.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.[CR]Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the \"Madman\" himself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.[CR]There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.[CR]Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]At the campaign select option from the main menu, enter the following codes to unlock subsequent missions.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]Enter [B]ILLBWBY[/B] at the password screen .[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]Enter [B]BQQQAEZ[/B] on the password screen to start with 10 lives.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.[CR]Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the \"Madman\" himself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.[CR]There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.[CR]Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]At the campaign select option from the main menu, enter the following codes to unlock subsequent missions.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]Enter [B]ILLBWBY[/B] at the password screen .[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]Enter [B]BQQQAEZ[/B] on the password screen to start with 10 lives.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dick Tracy is a side-scrolling shooter developed by Sega of America based on the Dick Tracy franchise. While released around the time of the 1990 Dick Tracy movie and heavily inspired by its look and setting, the game does not follow the movie's plot, instead telling an unrelated story about Tracy tracking down a suspicious nitroglycerin shipment.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Receiving word that Big Boy's gang is up to something at the train yard, Tracy arrives just in time to see them getting on a train carrying a shipment of nitroglycerin. Concerned, he tracks the shipment to a warehouse, only to see The Brow speed away with it. The Brow leads him to Lips Manlis, who reveals Big Boy has a secret explosives factory going, using the TNT produced to take out the competition.[CR]Hitting the streets for information on the factory, Tracy corners Shoulders who points him back to the warehouse. Tracy returns to investigate, however Big Boy's hitman Flattop awaits him there, to lure him into a trap. The trap fails, and Tracy manages to get the defeated henchman to give up his bosses' location. Now hot on Big Boy's trail, Tracy tracks him through the sewer, leading to the harbor, before a final confrontation in the nearby drawbridge gearhouse.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a side-scrolling shooter with occasional light platforming. To progress to the next scene, Tracy must get to the right end, avoiding or defeating the suit-clad mobsters who constantly pop out of doorways, behind objects, or the edge of the screen, going after Tracy with fists, knives, guns or explosives. Tracy himself is armed with a revolver and a tommy gun, the former for enemies at his front or back, while the latter fires stream of bullets used to take out enemies hiding in the background. His guns have unlimited ammunition, but Tracy will punch instead of shoot if enemies enter brawling range, gaining a \"punch bonus\" for each enemy defeated that way.[CR]Tracy has 4 to 8 health segments, depending on difficulty chosen, 2 lives, and 3 to 5 continue credits selectable from the options. As there are no items in the game, Tracy only regains health between scenes, but shooting gallery bonus levels between each stage allow Tracy to earn extra points and credits by hitting crooks while leaving cops and civilians unharmed. Most scenes have time limits between 3 and 4 minutes, and must be completed within that time or Tracy loses a life.[CR]Some scenes change the rules somewhat:Unarmed scenes strip Tracy of his guns, usually for flimsy story reasons. Because he does not have the tommy gun, they do not feature the enemy filled extended backgrounds, instead adding a bit of verticality with ladders and paths higher up on the screen.Vehicle scenes are fixed scrolling survival scenarios, where Tracy hangs on the outside of a police car, dodging incoming fire and shooting back at enemy cars, trying to stay alive for a set amount of time until he reaches the destination.Boss scenes play much like regular ones, except the stage boss is running around in the background, constantly attacking Tracy, and the scene doesn't end until the boss's health bar is depleted.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game consists of 6 stages, each divided into 3 scenes.StageSceneNameType1ATracy Gets a Leadregular1BSteve's Train Yardunarmed1CThe Wrong Side of the Tracksboss: Itchy2ADestination - 7th St. Warehouseregular2BThe Chase!vehicle2CA Browbeating Under the Elboss: The Brow3AHitting the Streetsregular3BRacing Down First Streetvehicle3CDrinks Are on the Houseboss: Lips Manlis4AA Hold Up in the Back Alley!unarmed4BBack to the Warehouse!regular4CAn Explosive Confrontation!boss: Pruneface5ASearching the Warehouseregular5BA New Lead?vehicle5CTracy Falls into a Trap!boss: Flattop6AAfter a Rat!unarmed6BHarboring a Fugitive!regular6CShowdown at the Gearhouse!boss: Big Boy[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the options screen press [B]Up, Down, A, A, B, C, C, start[/B].",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Goal! (aka Dino Dini's Soccer on the Mega Drive) is Dino Dini's next soccer game after Kick Off 2. Dino Dini is a musician, singer and songwriter who happens to also be a computer game developer specializing in football games, which is the field he is most known for. It's a top down soccer game.[CR]Goal! might look like Sensible Soccer (little men on the pitch) but plays very differently. In order to pass the ball the player needs to press and hold the joystick button. The player will keep the ball at his feet. Choose a direction with the joystick and release the button. The player will pass the ball in the designated direction. Shooting is done by pressing the button once and applying after touch. You can chip the ball, by pushing the joystick up and down quickly. Pressing the button while the ball is in mid air will result in a header by the nearest player. Sliding is really exaggerated. Sometimes players come flying in. Taking corners and free kicks is easy. Before the kick is taken, a dotted line is drawn away from the ball. This is controlled by the joystick, and is used to determine the angle, strength and trajectory of your shot.Throw-ins also use this method, though, which is a shame because now they tend to break up the flow of the game.[CR]The game is real fast paced.[CR]There are four views to choose from. A bird's eye view and a close-up view, up or down or left to right. The close-up view makes the game unplayable because you almost can't see where your team members are positioned.The game features very intelligent computer opponents who do not just stick to set pieces- they actually think for themselves.The action replay facility has been extended over the previous Kick Off games. The function keys are used to control fast forward, rewind and slow motion functions, very much like a video editor. When a goal is scored, the replay is shown automatically, as is the trend with recent games. The facility is also available for you to record all of the action replays within a game to disk.[CR]Graphics are clear 2D sprites. Sound effects are limited to the occasional crowd noise and ball bouncing and whistle.[CR]You can compete in a lot of different European leagues and international tournaments. No licensed players though. You can play with a range to European country teams, of which you can change the starting line-up and formation. All the Premier leagues are in there, with authentic home and away kits and up-to-date squads, as well as a full complement of international teams. You can also edit them to create your own custom teams, change the names of all the players and redesign the kit designs and colours, although the actual statistics of the individual players can't be altered, and the teams are all of differing standards. You can even choose the referee for the match, with each ref's statistics determining what percentage of fouls he spots and how tough he is on penalising. If a player gets away with a couple of fouls, he's more likely to get a yellow or red card when he commits another foul later on.[CR]Also there, is the arcade Challenge mode, in which your games play successively in five different speeds, until you lose. As you win each game, your goal difference is multiplied by the number of the stage, and added to your overall score.A competition or a practise match is also possible. The most notable exception, however, is the lack of a cup competition. Finally the game lets you adjust some of the settings, like wind strength, the kind of pitch, the game duration, level of difficulty and game speed of the computer opponent, etc. Goal! was published by Virgin games and it shipped 60,000 units on the first day. Goal! is also converted to Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in North America) and Super NES.captioncaptioncaption[CR]",

At the beginning of almost every level, you will find a shop where you can buy powerups, tricks, and extra lives. Buy them all. They will definitely help you on your way. This addition to the Double Dragon series featured some pretty cool improvements. One was a new character. He's a really big guy by the name of Roney. He's pretty tough. I especially like his jump back spin kick. Another improvement was the ability to jump on an enemy while they are down. If you knock someone down, you can push the jump button right afterwards and jump on them. You have to be careful though, some enemies will hit you while you are in the air. Just be sure the foe is all alone before trying it. Double Dragon 3: The Arcade Game is a very fun game and it's a great addition to the Double Dragon family.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II centers around the murder of Marian[CR]Originally released in 1988 as an arcade game, Double Dragon II: The Revenge is the sequel to Double Dragon, which was released in 1987. Double Dragon II once again stars Jimmy and Billy Lee as they investigate the murder of Marian, the love interest of the series. Marian was shot to death by a group known as the Black Warriors. Other than the original arcade release, there have been a variety of home console versions, including releases for the NES, Game Boy, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Amiga. These versions all differ in a variety of ways, from minor elements to major gameplay changes.[CR]On March 10, 1990, Meldac released the soundtrack of Double Dragon II: The Revenge in Japan. Featuring new renditions of the songs from the NES version of the game, including arranged songs and a pop remix of the opening theme, with vocals sung by Manami Morozumi. The soundtrack, composed by Kazuhiro Hara and Nobuhito Tanahashi, contains 13 songs, two of which are different renditions of the same song (Dead or Alive, one with lyrics and one without).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade Version The first level in the arcade game.[CR]The original arcade release is essentially the same as its predecessor. The game is a side scrolling beat-em-up, in which players can fight enemies across a four stages: an airport, lumberhouse, a field, and the base of operations for the Black Warriors. The largest differences between the original Double Dragon and Double Dragon II are improved moves, range of attack, and control scheme. In Double Dragon, players could either kick or punch. Double Dragon II changes this, and opts instead for directional based attacks (e.g. if the player is facing to the right, one button will send out a flurry of punches and the other button will have the character kick from the back).[CR]In addition to friendly characters, all of the enemies have received significant makeovers as well. As well as a range of new enemy characters (including the final boss, Willy, leader of the Black Warriors), enemies now have new weapons to carry around and use, including shovels and hand grenades. Enemy attacks are also modified, including a new range of combos and special attacks (to combat the new moves that Jimmy and Billy have received, such as the Hurricane Kick).NES Version The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard.[CR]Possibly the most well known version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, the NES version was originally released on December 23, 1989 in Japan, and then later released in North America during January of 1990. Published by Acclaim Entertainment and developed by Technos, Double Dragon II for the NES is very different from the arcade version on which it is based. Similar to the previous NES game, Double Dragon, this NES game is a one to two player side scrolling beat-em-up, although this was the first version of a Double Dragon game on the NES that could be played by two players simultaneously in co-op. The game has an expanded story, including cutscenes before each stage (of which there are nine). In addition, there is a separate final boss in the NES version, which can only be fought on the hardest difficult level. Upon being defeated, Marian is brought back to life (unlike the arcade version).[CR]The Lee brothers retain the bi-directional attacks from the arcade version (with B and A on the NES pad corresponding to Left and Right attacks, respectively) as well as the spinning Hurricane Kick special move. In addition, they can execute \"hyper\" uppercut and \"hyper\" flying knee attacks, which send enemies flying skyward and backwards, respectively. The latter move is particularly useful for making quick work of enemies (including boss characters) when fighting near a bottomless pit area. While the Hurricane Kick can be executed on the fly by jumping and then tapping both buttons at the peak of the jump, the latter two must be executed by timing button presses almost perfectly when the player character is just exiting his kneeling frame of animation (initiated by either landing from a jump or getting up from a fall), making them slightly more complex moves to pull off.[CR]Stage design (as well as several new stages with story sequences playing out before each one), modes, and the plot changes are all among the differences between the arcade and NES versions of Double Dragon II. Arguably the largest change is the addition of a two-player \"Mode B\", where the players can damage each other during the game - this factor was subsequently used to discover a number of exploits and shortcuts by the speedrun community. (Another side effect of \"Mode B\" was that if one player killed another, the first player would gain the life that the other player lost, something that could be used to give a single player up to 7 lives.) Additionally, Double Dragon II on the NES adds five new stages, differing enemies, radically different stage design, and a new final boss (named the Mysterious Warrior).Other Versions[CR]Other than the well-known arcade and NES versions, there have been a variety of other ports of Double Dragon II: The Revenge. Two other home console ports were produced in 1991 and 1993 (both exclusively in Japan) for the Sega Mega Drive and the PC Engine respectively. The Mega Drive version is largely unchanged from the arcade game, only slightly altering the second stage. The PC Engine version featured upgraded graphics (including the story sequences from the NES version, which are redone for this version), new music, slightly altered stage design, and voice acting for the main characters, including Billy, Jimmy, and Marian.[CR]Several ports were released for PC platforms as well, with Virgin Mastertronic and Binary Design handling ports to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST in 1989. These companies were the same companies to handle the PC ports of the original Double Dragon as well.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrackDead or Alive (2:48)The Vengeful Demon has Begun to Move (3:37)A Quiet Pursuit (3:01)Tension at the Night Sky (1:43)Advancing Towards Sunset (2:25)Escape to the Forest (3:43)Wicked God (1:25)Breaking the Barrier (2:37)Enter to the Enemy's Base (3:19)Roar of the Twin Dragons (3:55)Miracle of the Twin Dragons (1:25)Sweet Memories (3:13)[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Double Dragon V is based on a cartoon series.[CR]Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls was the fifth game to be released in the Double Dragon franchise. No longer property of Technos Japan Corporation, Double Dragon V is very different from previous games in the franchise. Double Dragon V was released on August 5, 1994 in North America (for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis) and April 5, 1995 for the Atari Jaguar (by Telegames). Developed by Leland Interactive Media and published by Tradewest, Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is a 2D fighting game based on the Double Dragon cartoon series, rather than being a side-scrolling beat-em-up like its predecessors.[CR]The game's plot loosely follows the Double Dragon cartoon series that was also produced by Tradewest. In the game, the Shadow Master creates a virus known as the Shadow Plague. In order to prevent the Shadow Master from unleashing the virus into Metro City, Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee must fight a variety of characters in one-on-one tournament battles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Billy Lee vs. Sickle[CR]Capitalizing on the incredible popularity of the tournament fighting genre in the 1990s (originating from Street Fighter II), Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is similar to many other fighting games from that time period. Players can use weak, medium, or strong punches and kicks to dispatch their opponents, utilizing a six-button layout similar to Street Fighter II. The Genesis version allows for a three-button layout, where allowing players to press the start button to switch between kicking and punching.[CR]Special moves are activated by holding down one direction, and then quickly shifting directions and hitting a certain button (e.g. holding left for two seconds, quickly pressing down and punch simultaneously will unleash a special attack from Jimmy Lee). This combination of button inputs was criticized by fans and critics who found it strange to have to quickly switch directions without sliding the control pad.The Quest Mode takes players through a story.[CR]There are several modes available in Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls. Tournament Mode is the default single player fighting mode, in which the player can fight through every character in the game in a random order. The multiplayer mode, VS. Mode, is a traditional two-player arena fighting mode, allowing players to choose whichever character they want. There is a second single player mode, Quest Mode, which adds a story, but is essentially the same as Tournament Mode. Quest Mode has two stories available; the Lee brothers fighting the Shadow Master, or one of the Shadow Warriors fighting to become his apprentice. Additionally, there is a mode that allows players to choose two computer controlled characters, and watch them fight each other.[CR]Another feature of Double Dragon V are Overkills, which are finishing moves that give a different losing animation for the defeated character. Each character has a special animation, triggered when they are killed with a specific attack. For example, the Lee brothers' Overkill is a flash of light, leaving the Lee brothers as a skeleton, with only their sword remaining.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Billy LeeBilly Lee[CR]Born on October 23, 1969, Billy Lee likes milk and doesn't like the Shadow Master. He is one of the two Lee brothers fighting against the threat of the Shadow Plague, a virus that the Shadow Master has threatened to unleash on the city. His Overkill involves a flash of light, ending with him as a skeleton with only his sword remaining. He was raised by the Oldest Dragon, and left to find his brother after learning the art of fighting.Jimmy Lee[CR]Also born on October 23, 1969, Jimmy Lee like video games and doesn't like bad hair days. The second of the Le twins, Jimmy Lee is the fair-haired brother. His Overkill is the same as his brother's; he transforms into a skeleton after a flash of light. Jimmy was raised by the Shadow Master, who deceived him into believing that the Shadow Master was his father. When he realizes the truth, he joins his brother Billy to become one of the Double Dragons.JawbreakerJawbreaker[CR]Born on March 23, 1963, Jawbreaker likes food, but doesn't like flossing. Originally from Des Moines, Jawbreaker practices the art of Che-Zit-Tsu. In Jawbreaker's Overkill, he falls to the ground after all of the teeth in his mouth fall out. Naturally, he loves eating, and thus his moves center around this.Icepick[CR]Born on February 20, 1965, Icepick likes Eskimo pies, but doesn't like the greenhouse effect. From Nome, Alaska, Icepick is well-trained in the fighting style of Icekido. In his Overkill, he is chopped in half and then collapses into a pile of ice. Icepick is the most intelligent member of the Shadow Warriors, as well as the team's computer expert.BonesBones[CR]Literally a skeleton, Bones is as old as dust.

He is one of the four characters created specifically for Double Dragon V.Trigger Happy[CR]Born on April 21, 1959, Trigger Happy likes crew cuts, but dislikes ballet. His fighting style, lock and load, mostly involves the usage of a large cannon on his right hand. In his Overkill, the aforementioned cannon explodes, killing Trigger Happy.CountdownCountdown[CR]A cyborg, Countdown's date of birth is listed as Cyborg Type 0041 Alpha. He like New Year's Eve, but dislikes DMV eye tests. Originally from New Orleans, his fighting style is the ancient art of dissin'. Countdown was a rejected cyborg from a bionics lab, purchased by a high profile video game company. In his Overkill, he glows until his entire body explodes.Sekka[CR]Another cyborg, Sekka was born on May 21, 1970. She likes talk shows, but hates commercials. With her Wolverine-like claws, she is adept in the art of Re-Boot-Tsu. In her Overkill, she begins to glow until she disappears completely, leaving only her clothes behind. As a child, she kept getting biotic implants, such as armor plated skin and claws. She is one of the four characters created specifically for Double Dragon V.DominiqueThe Shadow Master[CR]A dangerous woman, Dominique's birthdate is unknown. In her Overkill, she transforms into a pile of maggots. Dominique uses a variety of whip, knife, and high heel based attacks. Dominique is one of four characters created especially for Double Dragon V, as well as one of two secret unlockable characters.Shadow Master[CR]The mortal enemy of the Double Dragons and the leader of the Shadow Warriors, the Shadow Master was born centuries ago. His goal is to take over the entire world, something which he attempts in Double Dragon V. He has a variety of abilities, such as teleportation, shape-shifting, and two powerful weapons (a scythe and a sword). The Shadow Master's Overkill involves him melting into a pile of ashes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Disable Dizzies[CR]At the Menu Screen, enter Left, A, Down, Down, A, Right.

It continues several years after where Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes left off with the son of the hero and heroine from the first game investigating an incident in the nearby mountains involving people in strange spacesuits. The game plays similarly to the first, with traditional turn-based battles and additional party members that can be recruited as the game progresses.[CR]Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II (\"Eiyuu Densetsu\" translates directly as Legend of Heroes) was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and ported to the PC-9801, FM Towns, PC Engine, Super Famicom, Sega Mega Drive and MS-DOS. The Super Famicom version was published by Epoch and was compatible with the Barcode Battler system through an adapter peripheral that was sold separately. Several codes could be transferred via the device to unlock features in the game.[CR]Eiyuu Densetsu II marks the first true sequel from a game in the Dragon Slayer franchise, Nihon Falcom's RPG anthology series that changes settings and entire mechanics from game to game. The Legend of Heroes series would continue to receive many more sequels, including the Gagharv trilogy (The Legend of Heroes III, IV and V) and the Trails in the Sky trilogy (The Legend of Heroes VI, split into three separate games or \"chapters\"). [CR]Though The Legend of Heroes II: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch was labelled as the second game in the series for its US title, it was simply renamed as such to avoid sequel confusion, like how Final Fantasy IV was renamed II for its US release due to several games being skipped. Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II has yet to receive an official English localization, unlike its predecessor and five immediate successors.[CR]",

                "plot": "Dragon's Fury is an awesome pin ball game, and there's just not much I like better than a cool pin ball game. The graphics are really amazing. I haven't found a pin ball game on any system that looks this cool (besides Sonic Spinball, which you should check out if you like this game). The jewel tones and textured backgrounds are real eye candy. Knock the ball into a vortex or open mouth and you'll be taken to a bonus round where there will be some foul creature (one of them looks like it has been turned inside out and one is a hydra... how cool is that?) that you'll have to destroy.[CR]So, the music is terrible 80's rock. I'm willing to overlook it.... this time. This game is loads of fun and quite a challenge. All pin ball games are challenging, but with this one you get cool bosses to beat and not only do you have to have the skill to hit your target, but you also have to figure out where to hit to begin with. Animation is pretty smooth, though sometimes you can lose track of the ball with all the stuff going on on screen.[CR]WARNING! Very, very addictive game![CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]The first thing you probably want to do is to go into options and change the controls. I usually don't mess with this, but this game starts out set up kind of strange. The default has you using the B button for the right flipper, the A button to tilt and the D pad (down) for the left flipper.[CR]You might like having the flippers set up this way, but I found myself very uncomfortable with this configuration, so I changed it. You can go to Options and set the controls as whatever you like by highlighting each thing and then pressing the button you would like that function to be.[CR]To begin with, you probably want to launch the ball all the way to the top. Just pull it back all the way and let it fly. This will put you in the center section of the screen. Here there is a head that can be changed by launching the ball into the red pentacle vortices (that's plural for vortex) and when it is changed fully (into a dragon head) you can enter the mouth to go on to a bonus stage. If a vortex (or any other likely place) has a yellow arrow in front of it, the bonus stages can also be gotten to through there. There's also a top section. Here there is a skeleton stretched out along the top, a clock in the center which little guys will march around occasionally, and several vortices. Hitting one of these vortices or going into the skeleton's mouth when there is a yellow arrow in front of them will take you to a bonus stage. Also there's a bottom section. Don't drop out of the bottom of the screen or you will lose a ball.[CR]In the bonus stages you will have to face different monsters, for example:[CR]Stage 2 Bat Pots[CR]In this stage there will be three gold pots on the screen out of which fly bats. Bats explode when you hit them and can send the ball off in random directions. The object here is to break the pots by hitting them over and over.[CR]Stage 5 The Wizards[CR]In here you will have to hit wizards as they roam around the screen. If you hit them while they are over a black dot on the floor it will turn the dot red. The object on this level is to turn all of the dots red. This level will require a lot of flipper catching to wait for wizards to be where you need them as there are fewer and fewer dots to change. Bust open the doors at the top center of the screen and it will give you another wizard producer. The more wizards on the screen, the better your chances of changing all the dots.[CR]Stage 6 Ewwww[CR]This is the one that looks like an exploded person. Out of the head at the top center of the screen will come a blue snake-like thing. You must hit this snake-thing on the end (head?) 9 or 10 times. Then it will turn loose and begin to fly around. Now hit it 9 or 10 more times and it'll blow up. Now the head at the center of the screen will begin to spout smoke. It's very easy to lose track of the ball at this point so be careful. Now hit the head 9 or 10 times and it'll explode.[CR]Getting to a bonus stage can be tricky. Some places will take you to random stages and some will take you to the same stage over and over. The Hydra at the bottom of the screen will always take you to the Hydra stage and going into the mouth of the helmeted dragon lady in the center of the screen will always take you to the \"Ewwwww\" stage. Dropping out of the bottom in a bonus stage does not cause you to lose a ball. This only means that you will be transported back to the first screen without having completed that stage. The object of the game is to complete all of the stages, but is 6 all there is?.....[CR]Two players will alternate each time a player loses a ball. Extra balls are awarded by completing special tasks, not necessarily through points.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An alien invasion has begun on Earth. The aliens are turning police officers into Pig Cops, abducting women and impregnating them with alien fetal spawn, and generally causing massive death and destruction across a variety of locations. As Duke Nukem, players will make use of a variety of unique weapons, such as the Devastator, Shrink-ray or Freezethrower, all in the name of saving Earth's women and busting alien skulls. For the first time in the series, the franchise was taken to a first-person perspective and took the big rival franchise of Doom head-on. The gaming market was filled with first-person shooters at the time of release, but Duke Nukem 3D's unique mix of setting, attitude, and sense of humor made the game into an instant hit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The first level of the game.[CR]Duke Nukem 3D was a technical step forward for the first-person shooter genre at the time of release. The player was able to crouch, jump, and look up and down, which allows for more interesting level design and enemy placements than was previously seen in other games in the genre. To complete a level, the player must find the exit marker, which is depicted as a nuclear symbol, and press it. To reach the exit, the player must often search the level for key cards and open their corresponding doors. Unlike many other games in the genre at the time of release, the levels of Duke Nukem 3D took place in relate-able and recognizable real-world locations such as movie theaters, streets, Chinese restaurants, and even strip clubs.[CR]Another aspect of the level design that made Duke Nukem 3D stand out from other games in the genre at the time of release, was the unseen high amount of interactivity the player had with the game-world. Players have various ways of interacting with the environment; light switches can be turned on/off, urinals can be used, water can be drunk, strippers can be tipped, etc.[CR]Duke Nukem frequently spouts one-liners; the majority of which are lifted directly from various movies with heavy cult followings like Big Trouble in Little China, Army of Darkness, They Live, and others.[CR]Duke Nukem 3D contains a big roster of enemies ranging from simple sharks to huge missile-firing Assault Commanders. The enemies all have different characteristics and attributes, which allowed the designers to create interesting combinations to challenge the player. To overcome the enemies, the player had a wide range of very different and unique weapons at his disposal. Besides the traditional firearms such as a pistol and a shotgun, Duke Nukem 3D includes many innovative weapons such as the shrink ray, pipe bombs and the freezethrower.[CR]To further aid the player in their victory, the game includes various different useable items such as first aid kit, scuba gear, body armor; and more unconventional items such as Holoduke, steroids, and a jetpack. The Holoduke allows the player to place a copy of themself in the world for a limited time to confuse enemies, the Steroids allow the player to move faster for a limited time, and the jetpack enables the player to fly within the boundaries of the levels.MultiplayerCo-operative play.[CR]Duke Nukem 3D on the PC offers multiplayer via LAN and modem-based services for up to 8 players. The game's multiplayer can take place on the levels from the game's single-player as well as some included multiplayer-only levels. The included editor also allows the players to play on their own created levels. Duke Nukem 3D shipped with two modes of multiplayer, and a third was added in the Plutonium Pak.Co-operative allows the players to team up and play single-player levels together.Dukematch is the deathmatch of Duke Nukem 3D. The first player to reach a certain score, or being on top of the scoreboard when the time runs out, is declared the winner. It is also possible to set up teams, so that the players both have allies and enemies in the same match.Duke Tag is akin to the capture the flag game mode. This game mode is not available from any menu, but is in fact hidden in level E4L10. If the level in Dukematch is started with at least four players present, a switch at the starting area of player 1 will become visible. Pressing this switch will enable Duke Tag mode, and the players will have to choose whether they want to be on Green or Brown team by walking into a teleporter.[CR]When a game is in progress it is possible to communicate with the other players by typing chat messages. It is additionally possible to taunt the other players by making use of the game's 12 pre-recorded Duke Nukem one-liners. These can be played by pressing \"Alt\" + \"F1\"-\"F12\" during play.[CR]Technology[CR]Almost as important as the game itself was Duke Nukem 3D's use of Ken Silverman's Build Engine. The Build Engine allowed for rooms to be built directly above another, sloped surfaces, and even moving geometry. The player is able to interact with the environment in revolutionary ways, causing buildings to collapse, blasting holes in walls, riding moving tramways, as well as other ways to interact with the environment.Continued Development by FansThe High Resolution Pack for Duke Nukem 3D.[CR]The source code for Duke Nukem 3D v1.5 was released as open-source on April 1st 2003, and fans quickly begun porting the game to different operating systems. As of 2010, the game supports online multiplayer and several 3D engines exist which allow the game to be enjoyed by fans with newer, higher quality graphics - the most popular being EDuke32. To further enhance the visual quality of the game, a community project is creating high-resolution textures and 3D models for the game.EDuke32 - Windows/Linux/Mac OSX port.High Resolution Pack - New textures and 3D models.[CR]Expansions[CR]In the wake of Duke Nukem 3D's success, the game received four expansion packs:Plutonium Pak was the first expansion pack for Duke Nukem 3D and the only one created by 3D Realms themselves. The expansion added the 4th episode \"The Birth\" consisting of 11 new levels, and introduced a new weapon (the Microwave Expander), two new types of enemies, and a new boss. The Plutonium Pak upgrades Duke Nukem 3D from version 1.13d to version 1.4 which is dubbed \"The Atomic Edition\".Duke it out in D.C. was developed by Sunstorm Interactive and was the first expansion pack not developed by 3D Realms. This expansion adds a new episode, in which Duke Nukem heads to the white house to save President Clinton. This expansion did not alter any of the enemy types or weapons.Duke: Nuclear Winter was developed by Simply Silly Software with permission from 3D Realms. The expansion added a new episode in which Duke Nukem heads to the North Pole to kill an alien-controlled Santa Claus. The expansion adds new enemies, such as snowmen and elves, and new music.Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach was the second expansion developed by Sunstorm Interactive and the last official expansion for Duke Nukem 3D. The expansion adds a new Caribbean-themed episode with areas like hotels, swimming pools, and beaches. Furthermore, the expansion altered the visual appearance of every weapon and enemy.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The enemy roster of Duke Nukem 3D consists primarily of different types of aliens with aid from mechanical/robotic machinery. The enemies are shown as 2D sprites in-game due to the limitation of the Build Engine, which mean they appear as flat and paper-like. In the Nintendo 64 version, the last boss (the Cycloid Emperor) was remade as a fully 3D polygonal model. The enemies are listed in order of appearance.Standard Enemies[CR]The standard enemies populate the levels of Duke Nukem 3D. Six enemies are introduced in the game's first episode, five in the second, one in the third, and two in the fourth.Assault Trooper[CR]One of the weakest and most common enemies in the game. The assault troopers often appear in groups and have the ability to use a jet-pack to attack the player from different altitudes, but their low amount of HP prevents them from becoming a serious threat to the player; a single shotgun blast, or a few pistol rounds, is enough to kill it. Despite using alien laser guns for their attacks, they may drop Pistol ammo upon death for the player to pick up.Assault Captain[CR]An upgraded version of the assault trooper. They have the same amount of HP as the Assault Trooper, but instead of having the ability to use a jet-pack, they can teleport. Upon using the teleportation skill, the Assault Captain will disappear for a few seconds, only to appear again - usually behind the player if possible. Just like the assault troopers, the assault captains may drop pistol ammo upon death despite using alien laser guns for their attacks.Pig Cop[CR]The pig cop is, together with the assault trooper and the assault captain, one of the most commonly encountered enemies in the game. They are depicted as pig-mutated members of the police force. They are armed with shotguns which makes them a serious threat for the player at close quarters. They are twice as tough as the assault trooper and captain, and require two shotgun blasts to kill. May drop a shotgun or a used body armor upon death.Turret[CR]The damage of this rarely-encountered enemy is low, but they're often placed in hard-to-reach spots, which makes them dangerous to an unaware player. Due to their small size, they are hard to hit with conventional firearms without getting too close. The players best bet is to use explosive weaponry.Recon Patrol Vehicle[CR]Although encountered in one of the first levels of Duke Nukem 3D, this enemy is one of the rarest in the game. Their damage is the same as a turret, but they are much tougher and can take a high amount of damage before the vehicle crashes to the ground. From the exploding wreckage, a pig cop pilot will emerge and continue to attack the player just like a regular pig cop.Octabrain[CR]These eight-brained monsters will attack the player by shooting plasma matter towards the player. They will even bite the player if he gets too close. Their plasma attack travels slowly through the air and are easy for the player to dodge. The octabrains have no legs and are floating slowly though the air instead. Their head is covered with thick skin and are one of the toughest standard enemies in the game in terms of amount of hit points.Assault Enforcer[CR]This enemy type is first encountered in the game's second episode, \"Lunar Apocalypse\". Assault enforcers are agile lizard-like aliens that are able to jump, which make them able to traverse ledges. They use a chaingun as their primary form of attack and will occasionally spit acid at the player, which will both deals damage and obscures the vision for a short amount of time. The assault enforcers are about as tough as the pig cops and may drop ammunition for the ripper chaingun, or even the weapon itself, upon death.Sentry Drone[CR]This enemy type is a slow-moving aerial bomb. Once they sense the player is in proximity, they will emit a distinctive sound and head right towards him. When the sentry drone reaches the player, it will self-destruct and deal a high amount of damage. The sentry drones should therefore be a target of high priority for the player in any given battle. The sentry drones are quite tough and can take a lot of damage before exploding. Whenever a sentry drone is hit by the player, they will slow down noticeable which allows for the player to keep them at bay.Protozoid Egg & Slimer[CR]The protozoid eggs aren't a threat to the player until they hatch. They usually hatch when the player comes within a certain range of them and unleash a protozoid slimer. The slimers are slow-moving, but they are able to crawl on ceilings as well as the floor and are able to quickly transition from one surface to the other. When they reach the player, they will block the screen and attacking with a low-damage bite. The slimers are very weak and die instantly from any damage source, and they often appear in high numbers.Assault Commander[CR]The Assault Commander is one of the toughest types of enemies in the game. It has a high amount of HP and he fires missiles towards the player as his primary attack. The missiles are somewhat slow-moving, but they deal a high amount of damage in a large radius on impact. If the player moves into melee distance of an Assault Commander, it will start spinning its blade-equipped platform and damaging the player. Assault Commanders are an aerial enemy and can follow the player anywhere. Once the Assault Commander has spotted the player, it can be heard making grunt noises and the occasional taunt \"Suck it down!\" and \"Die, human!\"Shark[CR]The only enemy in the game from Earth. Sharks are rarely encountered throughout the game, as they can only appear in pools of water. Their only attack is a melee attack and even in water they are very slow-moving. Sharks have a low amount of hit points, which makes them one of the easiest enemies to kill in Duke Nukem 3D.Protector Drone[CR]Added in the Plutonium Pak.[CR]The toughest standard enemy the player will encounter in the entire game. Protector drones have a high amount of hit points, are fast-moving, and deals a lot of damage. They primarily use their melee attack, but occasionally they will shoot a Shrink-ray projectile towards the player. This projectile has the same effect as the shrink ray weapon the player possesses, which mean the player will become shrunk if he gets hit by the projectile. Should this happen, every enemy in will attempt to step on and squish the player, which results in an instant death. As protector drones were added to Duke Nukem 3D in the Plutonium Pak, they only appear in the fourth episode.Pig Cop Tank[CR]Added in the Plutonium Pak.[CR]A pig cop driving a single-seated riot tank. Just like the recon patrol vehicle, a pig cop will appear and fight on when the vehicle gets destroyed. The pig cop tank are slow-moving, slow-turning, deals a moderate amount of damage, and have a very high amount of hit points. They do, however, have a weak spot on their back. This, combined with their slow turning speed, allows the player to circle around them and attack them from behind. As pig cop tanks were added to Duke Nukem 3D in the Plutonium Pak, they only appear in the fourth episode.Boss Enemies[CR]At the end of each episode, the player will have to fight a boss-type enemy. These boss fights often take place in arena-like surroundings with lots of weaponry and ammunition for the player to pick up.Battlelord[CR]The Battlelord is first seen at the end of episode 1 and his death marks the end of said episode. He is wielding a huge chaingun with an attached grenade launcher, which makes him very dangerous to the player. Being a boss-type enemy, the Battlelord has a very high amount of hit points. This, combined with the high damage output, forces the player into a battle of resources, where he continuously have to collect health items and ammunition to ensure the boss drops dead before the player himself.[CR]As with all bosses, actually touching the massive beast results in instantaneous death. In the later episodes, Duke will encounter Mini-Battlelords, which are visually identical, lesser versions of the Battlelord with less health and without the ability to crush Duke on contact. The Mini-Battlelords are the the toughest non-boss enemies.Overlord[CR]The Overlord is the leader of the alien invasion force stationed on the moon, and is the last boss of the second episode in Duke Nukem 3D. He has a huge fast-firing dual rocket launcher attached to his back, which is his only way of attacking the player. Although the Overlord constantly barrages the player with incoming missiles, the Overlord is proclaimed to be the easiest boss in the game, since his attacks can be avoided by simply circle-strafing around him.[CR]Like other bosses, he has a large amount of hit points, high damage output, and can instantaneously kill the player if he gets too close. Unlike the Battlelord, the Overlord only appears once in Duke Nukem 3D. He did, however, appear in a weaker state on some levels in the Nintendo 64 version. The Overlord's real claim to fame was when Duke Nukem threatened him with: \"I'm gonna rip off your head and shit down your neck.\", a threat he carried out in the end-of-episode cutscene.Cycloid Emperor[CR]The final and most powerful boss of the original three episodes of Duke Nukem 3D. The Cycloid Emperor is the leader of the alien force, and the final battle takes place on en American football stadium. When attacking he uses one of his robotic arms to rapidly fire missiles towards the player. The Cycloid Emperor's missiles are moving faster than the Overlord's, which makes them harder for the player to avoid. Similar to the primary attack of the octabrains, the Cycloid Emperor is able to shoot plasma matter at the player through his mouth. Like the other end-of episode bosses before him, the Cycloid Emperor can instantly kill the player if the player gets too close.[CR]After the Cycloid Empreror dies, a cutscene is shown. The cutscene features Duke Nukem kicking the back of the Cycloid Emperor's head so hard that his eye rockets out and sails between the uprights, causing Duke to throw his arms up in the traditional touchdown-gesture and triumphantly shout \"Game over!\".Alien Queen[CR]Added in the Plutonium Pak.[CR]The final boss of the episode added in the Plutonium Pak. The Alien Queen is the mother of all Protector Drones (the new alien threat), and it is Duke Nukem's goal of the episode to kill her. The final battle takes place under water in an alien cave-like environment, and the Alien Queen will occasionally give birth to additional Protector Drones throughout the fight. She has a lightning attack with a large range, and the player will die instantaneously if he gets too close.[CR]Since the player will have to deal with the additional protector drones, the Alien Queen herself does not have that many hit points compared to the other bosses, but the situation is still a challenge to the player. Not only does he have to kill the Alien Queen, he is also required to take care of the Protector Drones and make sure he doesn't run out of air.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Mighty Boot[CR]Can be used when Duke's either out of ammo. Duke Nukem is able to kick alien monsters in the face, while he's shooting them at the same time. Truly the ultimate alien ass kicker. Since this is the unarmed weapon of the game, the damage is rather low. The quick kick (which can be immediately triggered no matter what weapon is currently in-hand), however, is a nice addition to damage whenever an enemy is up close.Pistol[CR]The most basic weapon in the game. Whenever Duke's low on ammo, or simply want to save the powerful weapons for a better time, don't hesitate to use the pistol. Its damage is low, it is fast-firing and accurate, making it a reliable all-around weapon.Shotgun[CR]The shotgun is generally considered the \"workhorse\" of the game, doing most of the hard work. The damage is - like any shotgun - great up close, but rather dull at longer distances. It's able to kill most enemies in the game with one or two direct hits, and ammo is plentiful.Ripper Chaingun[CR]The Ripper, like the pistol is a rapid-fire bullet weapon. It does more damage and fires faster than the pistol, but has reduced accuracy and scarcer ammo. Most enemies will no fare well against the Ripper, their health rapid depleting. Weaker enemies are eviscerated almost instantly.RPG[CR]This unbelievably powerful weapon is a danger to everyone - including Duke. One misfired rocket into a wall, and he's dead. It's often a good idea to save the ammo for very hard encounters (e.g. boss fights).Pipe Bomb[CR]The pipe bomb is the grenade of Duke Nukem 3D. When tossed, Duke pulls out a remote detonator, and upon pressing the fire button again, blows up the pipe bomb. The explosive damage of the pipe bombs are massive. Players are able to pick up a thrown pipe bomb to cancel out of the detonation prompt. Pipe bombs can also be detonated by being shot, and players who have thrown a pipe bomb can press the 6 button again to bring up another pipe bomb without detonating the first one. Upon hitting the big red detonator, all pipe bombs the player has placed will simultaneously explode. This can be used to set large clusters of pipe bombs as a trap for aliens or unsuspecting players.Shrink Ray[CR]The Shrink Ray is a unique weapon, and is an iconic weapon in the Duke Nukem franchise. It does exactly what it says on the box - shrinks enemies to the size of an action figure. After doing this, the player can run up to the victim and stomp him into goo. When he's the victim of the shrink ray, Duke moves extra fast and are unable to attack. He can, however, still use items (medkit, holoduke etc.), while fleeing the feet of his enemies. There are certain points in the game where Duke himself must be shrunk in order to get through small areas. There is a time limit when Duke is shrunk and if he is in a place too small for normal Duke, he will die upon expanding back to normal size.Devastator[CR]The devastator is a double-barrelled fully automatic rocket launcher able to clear a room of enemies in seconds. Its firing rate is quick, and though its ordinance does less damage than the RPG, it has a higher DPS. However, the ammo for this weapon is relatively scarce.Laser Tripbomb[CR]The laser trip mines are mines that are placed on any wall by the player, creating a beam that extends to the other side of the wall. When an enemy crosses the beam, the laser mine explodes. Valve had their own version of the laser trip mine in Half-Life, but it was practically identical. In practice, the laser trip mine was of limited usefulness, as the explosion was only the size and strength of an RPG blast, and it only came from the mine itself. In the single-player mode, it was only ever deployed in areas where the explosion would hurt or kill Duke, but in multiplayer, it could easily be placed on a open area where a player could set it off far enough away from the mine that they take no damage.Freezethrower[CR]The freezethrower is an automatic weapon that fires ice crystals, which freeze victims solid. When frozen, any sort of damage will instantly kill them. When walking up to a frozen enemy, Duke will automatically shatter them with a kick. In addition, the ice crystals ricochet off walls, giving them the tactical ability to be shot bounced around corners as well as the danger of self freezing. The freezethrower's ice crystals will only hurt a victim until they reach 1 HP, at which point they will be frozen. Players can save ammo by hurting them with regular weapons before using the freezethrower to finish them off, or use the freezethrower to weaken the enemy to the point of becoming frozen, then shooting the enemy to shatter and kill it.Microwave Expander[CR]Added in the Plutonium Pak.[CR]The new microwave expander weapon looks a lot like the Shrinker from the original game, but instead of a green glowing crystal it's equipped with a red crystal and a small satellite. Compared to the shrinker from the original game, the expander does the exact opposite: expands enemies until their bodies burst. The burst even deals damage to nearby enemies, making the Expander one of the coolest and funniest weapons in the Duke Nukem arsenal.[CR]Episodes & Levels[CR]Duke Nukem 3D and Plutonium Pak level designers:AB - Allen H. Blum IIILL - Richard Bailey Grey (also known as the 'Level Lord')RP - Randy PitchfordKS - Keith SchulerGB - George Broussard[CR]Since the game followed the famous shareware-model, the game was released in episodes. Duke Nukem 3D consisted of three episodes at the time of release: L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Scrapnel City. A fourth episode, The Birth, was later added to the game in the Plutonium Pak. Following is a list of the game's four episodes with included designer credit:Episode 1: L.A.

Released on October 31, 1997, Duke Nukem 64 featured a number of major and minor changes to the game to make it more suitable for its new platform and audience. Some of these changes were superficial censorship edits to fit better with Nintendo's family-friendly policies while others were governed by the technical limitations of the platform.[CR]Some of the most obvious alterations to the game are the removal of Duke Nukem 3D's more controversial elements. All women have been given additional layers of clothing, strippers won't actually strip, Duke never uses profanity or makes lewd comments, steroids have been renamed to \"Vitamin X\", and pornography on TV and movie screens have been replaced with alternate content. Some mature locations were replaced, such as the pornography store being replaced by a gun store and a strip club being replaced by a warehouse. Captive women in alien pods were left in the game (though with more 'pod' added to better cover their nudity) and, instead of killing them, Duke saves them by \"teleporting\" them - this counts towards a new end level goal.Some of the sexual references were replaced in this version. [CR]The new engine for the Nintendo 64 includes new elements not seen in any other version at the cost of technical limitations. The game is no longer played in episodes, just as one long sequence of levels. Some aliens and levels along with the new weapon from the Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D have been added. Most of the maps have received a large number of modifications to them. (Such as a new area in the Red Light District level) Most of the graphics for the weapons and the enemies have been replaced. Some polygonal 3D effects have been added, such as advanced explosion and smoke effects. However, skyboxes are simple one color textures and mirror effects were not implemented. Music was completely removed from the game, with the exception of the memorable title theme.[CR]The game also adds local multiplayer via splitscreen for up to four players on dukematch and two players on co-operative, along with the addition of bots. Three of the weapons from the original game are replaced (dual-wielded SMGs replace the ripper chaingun cannon, a grenade launcher replaces the RPG, a plasma cannon replaces the freezethrower, and a missile launcher replacing the devastator). Some weapons have alternate ammo, such as the missile launcher gaining heat seeking missiles, the handgun firing powerful dum-dum rounds, and the shotgun firing explosive shells.Sega SaturnDuke Nukem 3D for the Sega Saturn.[CR]Duke Nukem 3D for the Sega Saturn was developed by Lobotomy Software and published in 1997 by Sega (the last game under its Deep Water label for adult games). It featured a unique in-house engine, dubbed SlaveDriver, previously used in the Sega Saturn port of PowerSlave. The engine allowed enhanced lighting effects and a unique viewpoint tilt while turning and strafing, at the cost of \"level splitting\" (where Toxic Dump, Fusion Station, Dark Side, The Abyss, and Overlord are split into two levels) and no moving sectors (such as the train cars in Rabid Transit). The game also featured online multiplayer via the Sega NetLink accessory for up to two players in DukeMatch or Co-operative.[CR]The game, like the Nintendo 64 version, is no longer played in episode, just as one long sequence of levels. The player can no longer save at any point during the gameplay, only after a level has been completed. The game also features a new secret joke level, named Urea 51, which is reached from Fahrenheit. All of the remastered music were arranged by Scott Branston.[CR]Also featured in the Sega Saturn version is a hidden game, named Death Tank Zwei. It is the sequel to the hidden bonus game, Death Tank, from the Saturn version of PowerSlave and the predecessor to Death Tank for the Xbox Live Arcade. The game was accessed either by playing through the main game, smashing every single toilet in the game, or by having save data from the Sega Saturn port of Quake. The game is a 2D multiplayer real-time tank shooter similar to Scorched Earth, supporting up to seven players at a time. A limited version of Death Tank Zwei was included in Death Tank for the Xbox Live Arcade.PlayStationDuke Nukem: Total Meltdown.[CR]Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown (also known simply as \"Duke Nukem\" in Europe) is a direct port of Duke Nukem 3D for the PlayStation released in September 30, 1997 (for the U.S.). It contains the original three episodes along with an additional unique episode called \"Plug and Pray\", which added six new levels (complete with new music, graphics, and enemies) parodying games at the time (like Wipeout and Resident Evil). All the new enemies are variants of older enemies, such as blue-colored Assault Troopers, underwater Sentry Drones, and variants of Pig Cops. The episode also contains a new end boss (CyberKeef, who is similar to the Battlelord) All of the original music was remastered by Mark Knight.[CR]The Plug and Pray episode consists of:Level 1: Nightmare ZoneLevel 2: Trackside TragedyLevel 3: Gates MotelLevel 4: Duke RoyaleLevel 5: Alien RendezvousLevel 6: Ministry of FearSecret Level: Faces of Death (reached from Alien Rendezvous) (can be found in Duke Nukem 3D with cheats or multiplayer)Game.comDuke Nukem 3D for Game.com[CR]Duke Nukem 3D for the Game.com, developed by Tiger Electronics and released on January 1, 1997, is a loose adaptation of the PC game and is the first portable Duke Nukem game ever released. Due to the limitations of the platform, it was significantly altered from the PC version. Player movement was degenerated to the point of walking forwards and backwards and strafing left and right. By pressing either B or C, players could briefly turn left and right to shoot, but there was no way to permanently turn to face in another direction. The game engine was primitive, with orthogonal walls, only 4 weapons (Boot, Pistol, Shotgun, and RPG), only 4 enemies (assault troopers, pig cops, enforcers, and octobrains), and no items except for keycards, armor, and a health kit. The game came with 12 levels that were either completely linear or had a point that loops around the level, due to the control limitations.Mega DriveDuke Nukem 3D for the Mega Drive[CR]Duke Nukem 3D for the Sega Mega Drive is an obscure port that was developed and released by Tec Toy in 1998 in Brazil only. The game engine was drastically simplified to conform to the console's hardware, and came with 9 levels that were loose adaptations of the \"Lunar Apocalypse\" episode.Xbox Live ArcadeDuke Nukem 3D for XBLA[CR]Duke Nukem 3D was released for the Xbox 360 over Xbox Live Arcade on September 24th, 2008 for 800 Microsoft Points ($10). The game is a direct port of the Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D, adding new features such as automatically recording and saving game demos (and uploading a size-limited demo for Xbox Live friends to watch) and a new \"rewind\" ability, which allows Duke to respawn at any previous time point. Unfortunately, the game offers no local multiplayer, but allows Co-operative or Dukematch on Xbox Live for up to 8 players.[CR]The game features 12 achievements worth 200 gamerscore, with only 3 of those achievements requiring Dukematch play over Xbox Live. The game also features 2 unlockable gamerpics, one for loading the game (a portrait of Duke Nukem smirking) and one for unlocking all achievements (the biohazard symbol).[CR]On September 29th, 2008, VGChartz announced that Duke Nukem 3D had sold 40,000 units in 1 week -- making it the first game to beat Castle Crashers, which sold 19,000 units in its first week.iPhone[CR]This port features the three main episodes of the original Duke Nukem 3D. This version suffers from technical issues and doesn't include the in-game music. The framerate drops low when there are several enemies on screen, or even just several moving objects (in Episode 1 Mission 3, for example, the moving gears on the way to the blue key card slow it down), and mirrors slow it down as well (though there is an option to turn this off). The game is controlled using two touch-sensitive areas in each side of the screen. It can be switched to analog thumbsticks or digital touch areas, where one side of the screen is movement and the other is for aiming. Both have their ups and downs, but if the player can get used to the analog controls, they may be a better option.Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded[CR]A fan project to remake the entirety of Duke Nukem 3D using the Unreal Engine 3. Green-lighted by Gearbox Software (the current owners of the Duke Nukem IP,) Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded aims to use current technology to faithfully recreate the original game. Although it is unknown how long the project will take, multiple renders and concept art is available on the site, as well as updates from the team responsible for the task.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The soundtrack was composed by Lee Jackson and Robert Prince (a.k.a Bobby Prince). Both were previously employed at id Software; working on such titles as Wolfenstein 3D, Commander Keen and Doom & Doom II.[CR]There are a total of 42 tracks found in the game's files. Each level has it's own track, and so does the title screen, the opening cinematic for The Birth, and the multiplayer-only level 'Episode 1, Level 7'. The midi files themselves use the EMIDI format, designed by Lee Jackson and Jim Dose.NoTrack NameComposerLevelNotes1GrabbagLee JacksonTitle Screen / Main Menu / Main Theme2StalkerLee JacksonE1L1: Hollywood Holocaust3Taking the Death TollRobert PrinceE1L2: Red Light District4The City StreetsRobert PrinceE1L3: Death Row5Water WorldRobert PrinceE1L4: Toxic Dump6Sneaky SnakeRobert PrinceE1L5: The Abyss7The Call of DeathRobert PrinceE1L6: Launch FacilitySecret level8Ah, Geez!Lee JacksonE1L7: Faces of DeathDukematch-only level9Future Military ConquestsLee JacksonE2L1: Spaceport10Space StormRobert PrinceE2L2: Incubator11Gut WrencherRobert PrinceE2L3: Warp Factor12RoboCreepingLee JacksonE2L4: Fusion Station13Stalag 3-DLee JacksonE2L5: Occupied Territory14Pissed!Robert PrinceE2L6: Tiberius Station15Aliens, Say Your Prayers!Robert PrinceE2L7: Lunar Reactor16PlasmaLee JacksonE2L8: Dark Side17Alfred H.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The story begins during the closing onslaught of a goblin siege upon Duke Barrik's castle.  In the dying seconds before the castle is overrun, it magically teleports to a new and strange land!  In a valley surrounded by sheer cliffs, it falls to a likely band of heroes to venture into the unknown in an attempt to find allies and preserve the kingdom and culture.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game follows the relatively straightforward rules of party system adventuring, with the benefit of the player being allowed to customize their party before the game begins.  Like many RPG games, your party members start out as mere weaklings surrounded by superior beasts and enemies.  Progression in the early stages of the game demands some time spent on grinding levels and improving inventory items.  Combat has two modes, depending upon the given situation:Out in the open (valley, swamp etc) battles are a strategic affair utilizing a combination of ranged, magic and direct melee attacks.  It becomes important here to have a well rounded party to effectively dispose of enemies.  Attacks are based on turns during this combat, for instance, once your party has attacked, the enemy will counter.  In dungeons/caves the combat moves towards real-time, requiring the player to cycle through attacks using the A or B buttons.  Each attack is followed by the next party member, with the ability to actively retreat or pursue enemies should it be necessary.  In both cases the attack ritual is the same, with a different attacks mapped to both A and B. [CR]Visual Style[CR]In normal adventuring mode, 70% of the screen shows your party in the world from a distorted isometric viewpoint.  The other 30% of the screen shows status bars and pictures of each member of your party including which attacks are mapped to A and B buttons.  During underground adventuring in dungeons/caves, the screen changes to include a notepad section that describes traps, smells, approaching enemies and items found.  This effectively limits the viewport down to about 25% of the screen which displays a 3D dungeon/cave.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ClericProficient in both spell casting and fighting.  Many of their spells heal damage or negate adverse effects on party members.  FighterThe primary warriors of any party.  They generally have the most hit points and deal the most damage.  Fighters are great leaders to a party as they can absorb lots of damage, effectively protecting the other members.Magic-UserSpellcasters who have the lowest hit points yet can cause tremendous damage from range.  Magic-Users also have the ability to 'entangle' enemies effectively paralyzing them so they become vulnerable to melee attacks.ThiefSpecializing in stealth, sneaking up on opponents and removing traps.  Thieves are good in battle using ranged weapons such as bows and slingshots.DwarfA shorter, stockier version of the Fighter.  Dwarves receive as many hit points as Fighters and are just as good at dealing out damage.ElfCombining the skills of fighting and magic, elves are a good all rounder to any party.  They are neither as strong as Fighters, or as powerful as Magic-Users however.HalflingAn interesting combination of Fighter, Cleric and Thief, the Halflings can handle their own in a battle yet don't have the highest hit points, and they can also hide like a thief without some of the trap spotting abilities. Each character class can be male or female with the added ability to customize color, name and beginning stats. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronics Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 4,7,4,7 adding, \"...exceptional graphics for this type of game.  If you are into RPGs give this one a try you won't be disappointed\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Hold Start on controller two and quickly press Down, B, Right, Up, C, Left, A on controller one at the Sega logo when the game starts. A sound will confirm that you've entered it right. Begin playing the game and press Start to display the options screen. Use the ''Specials'' selection for a sound test and gold options.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim is a side-scroller shooter from Shiny Entertainment and the first game in their Earthworm Jim series. The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.[CR]Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.[CR]The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, \"New Junk City\". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blaster[CR]Jim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.[CR]Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping.[CR]Planets[CR]New Junk CIty[CR]Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck.Andy Asteroids?[CR]Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way.Psy-Crow[CR]A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue.What The Heck?[CR]Planet heck is a strange hell-type planet. This is where Evil the Cat lives and where the player must defeat the likes of lawyers and an un-meltable snowman. The player must complete the level while listening to horrifying elevator music.Down the Tubes[CR]Down the Tubes is an underwater level in which Jim must ride giant hamsters, knock over Bob the Killer GoldFish and complete the infamous tube race.Snot a problem[CR]Major Mucus is out to get Jim! Compete with him in a 3 round battle in which Jim and him both bungee jump down to infested waters and fight by swinging into each other and seeing which cord breaks first.Level 5[CR]The 5th level takes place in Professor Monkey for a head's lab. Watch out though, Jim may just lose his suit, make sure to get it back.Who Turned Out The Lights?[CR]A hidden area found in Level 5 which is completely blacked out besides spotlights, the enemies' eyes and doors.For Pete's Sake[CR]Jim has to escort a cute, tiny puppy named Peter through a level that consists of holes, tentacles and meteor showers. Peter is a small cute timid little dog, but when very frightened he becomes a raging monstrous Hulkish beast.Intestinal Distress[CR]The level takes place in the intestines of a strange creature and at the end of the tunnel Jim must face off against Doc Duodenum. The level is missing from the SNES and PC versions of the game.Buttville[CR]It's all come down to this, Jim is nearing the end of his journey! At the end of stage, prepare to face off against the appropriately named The Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Stinky, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt.[CR]Avatar Awards[CR]The XBLA version has 2 avatar awards to be earned.Earthworm Jim Suit - Complete a bonus level.Earthworm Jim T-Shirt - (Achievement: Bin Collector) Beat Billy the Bin in New Junk City.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim has an awesome soundtrack which consists of -Banjo RaceSnot a ProblemParty TimeFallingWhat the HeckButtsvilleBass MixJunkitBos AnneildPsy-crowDarkworm RagSubmergedYou're the bestEnd theme[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Pause the game and enter: [CR]A + B, C, C, A, A, B, B, B + C[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Any time during the game, pause it and press A and Left, B, B, A and Right, B, B, A.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 2 takes place right after the first game with our favorite worm hero, Earthworm Jim! He is once again caught up in another adventure as his old foe, Psycrow has taken interest in Jim's love interest, Princess What's Her Name. It's up to Jim to stop his enemies yet again in order to save his love, or in any other case, become the hero and save the day (again). But this time, Jim is not alone as his best friend Snot (a booger) joins him on his quest by making Jim stick to certain parts of any level and swing him into action. Along with his trusty Plasma Gun and a new Manta Shield, Jim must traverse into strange new levels and stop Psycrow before it's too late![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 2 has the same basic controls as the first game but with a few extra features added in. One of the first few things is that Jim does have a new friend called Snot and he can use him as a grapple like hook to get to some extra parts of the level. But in order to use Snot, make sure to find green spots on top of certain areas in the level. Replacing Jim's copter from the last game, Jim can use Snot to float down to other areas in order to catch himself.[CR]There is also some added items for Jim to collect and other weapons in this game. Jim can now collect Can O' Worms this time around by going into hidden areas in the level as well as collect health that goes up to 200%. Also as an added bonus, Jim can now collect Flags so that if you do collect all three flags in a given level, you unlock a password so that you can enter the level again.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]With the age of technology upon us, Jim now must travel to new, strange and often times, creepy, levels in order to get to Psycrow and save his love. But Jim must face many dangers in his path of justice and a hero has to start somewhere in the game and nowhere involves the beginning of any game then with pigs.Anything but Tangerines[CR]The start of Jim's crazy adventure begins in a distant planet of some kind where he encounters one of his foes, Bob the Goldfish and Number 4, his trusty cat friend with muscles the size of a few planets. Jim must use pigs in this level in order to bypass the many traps and falling grandmas in order to face Bob and defeat him in an epic battle of wits (or in this case, Bon's wits vs. Jim's small I.Q.).Lorenzo's Soil/Lorenzen's Soil[CR]Depending on what version of EWJ 2 you have, you might get a different name for this level in the game. Jim is deep underground and has a drill laser gun with unlimited ammo to get out of the dirt. However, he must collect clocks in order to stay alive. By the time you reach the end of this crazy place, Jim must face Pedro Pupa, a larvae on a unicycle in order to move on on his journey.Puppy Love Parts I, II and III[CR]Throughout the game, Jim must stop and ponder what he has to do in life but Psycrow has other plans by kidnapping the nephew's of Peter Puppy, Jim's best friend with anger management issues like no other. Using a giant marshmallow (where he found it, I don't know) and bounce the puppies back into Peter's home. Psycrow will throw in a bomb in there as well so make sure Jim can manage to get it to Peter. But don't drop any puppies, you really don't want to see Peter that mad and tear Jim's head of his super suit.The Villi People[CR]Jim's Now a Blind Cave Salamander!: As the title says, Jim has become a blind cave salamander and this level just gets the vote for making it the most interesting and weird level in an Earthworm Jim game. Just throw in a chance to be on a game show to actually get some prizes and this level has it all. Well, actually, it really does have a game show towards the end of the level and the questions are just plain weird and doesn't make any sense but hey, this is an Earthworm Jim game.The Flyin King[CR]Looks like Major Mucus hasn't learned his lesson since he and Jim fought in the first game and now he is back and greener then ever. Jim rides his trusty rocket and must move a bomb from one side of the level to the Major himself but it is no easy task when you got ships and people coming at you. Jim must be careful for if that bomb explodes at any time, he must go back to the beginning and do it all over again.Udderly Abducted[CR]Well, as the title suggests, aliens are trying to take all the cows on the planet and it looks like Jim has to stop them. The only way for Jim to even go past a checkpoint in the game is to literally pick up one of the many cows and milk them to get the checkpoint gate open. But you can't level them for too long however cause if you do, the aliens will take them away. And to make matters worse for Jim, some cows are bombs and you must soak them with water before taking them to a checkpoint. Jim isn't getting any love around here, that's for sure.Inflated Head[CR]Looks like our favorite evil cat has returned from Heck to bring Jim some pain. Evil the Cat runs the Carnival of Scars and will stop at nothing to defeat Jim. Jim uses the power of hot air to inflate his head to go high into the level and reach the end. Jim must dodge many neon lights and light bulbs or he will be sent down a few levels or even towards the beginning of the level again.ISO9000[CR]By the time Jim reaches this level, he really wants this adventure to end. Jim must traverse into the world of the office worker and jumping filling cabinets in order to pass the level. Jim must always go into paper shredders to progress in the level. And did i mention that towards the end, you must stop and trap a running door in order to move on in the game? Yup, nothing like that in any game you know huh?Level Ate[CR]This is by far a level most people might not want to stay forever. As the name suggests, Jim must traverse in the world of food and a never ending salt shaker floating in the air and dropping salt you. Lucky you, you run into some running snails to prevent yourself from getting hurt like crazy. But once you get to the end, you must face Flamin' Yawn on a giant pizza box. Yup, only Jim can have these kinds of adventures.See Jim Run, Run Jim Run[CR]This is it. Jim finally made it towards the end of the game and now must face Psycrow in an epic battle of foot racing? Sure enough, a race towards the end of the level is the goal and Jim must beat Psycrow in a race in order to get the hand of the Princess. Jim must destroy many traps and hope to stay ahead from his foe or Jim's adventure might end on this dangerous trip.[CR]Game Boy Advance Version[CR]While Earthworm Jim 2 had many critics loving the game, a few scratched their heads in confusion and anger when they released the game on the Game Boy Advance/game-boy-advance/60-4/, which contained many problems from the original game. Instead of having a great game for the portable system, you get a game that wasn't even tested right and a very buggy game, many saying that it is the worst game to ever be ported in the Earthworm Jim series (and that says a lot considering how well Earthworm Jim 3D was received).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Pause the game and enter the following:",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco the Dolphin (also known as Ecco) is an aquatic side-scrolling action-adventure game developed by Novotrade and published by Sega for the Genesis in Europe (on July 31, 1992), North America (on December 29, 1992), and Japan (on July 30, 1993).Players control a bottlenose dolphin named Ecco (unique to other dolphins for the six star markings on his forehead) as he embarks on a journey through the oceans, trying to figure out the whereabouts of his group (who were sucked up in a mysterious waterspout) while helping fellow dolphins along the way.Along with its unconventional gameplay mechanics (including a dedicated \"sing\" button for interaction and echolocation), the game is known for its extreme level of difficulty (which would be a staple for the main games of the series) and bizarre plot development (including time travel and alien abductions). It would later spawn a sequel (Ecco: The Tides of Time), a kid-friendly spin-off (Ecco Jr.), and a 3D reboot (Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future).Along with downscaled ports to the Sega Master System and Game Gear, the game was ported to the Sega CD less than a year later. This version (known in Japan as Ecco the Dolphin CD) features a bonus set of levels and new soundtrack (using Redbook audio), and was later ported to the PC in Japan and North America (both in 1996, featuring new high-resolution sprites). The original game was digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console on November 27, 2006), Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2007), PC (via Steam on June 1, 2010), and most iOS devices (on July 22, 2010), and was included in two compilations: Sega Genesis Collection (for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable), and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3).An enhanced port was made for the Nintendo 3DS (as 3D Ecco the Dolphin, part of Sega's 3D Classics remake series) and digitally released on the 3DS eShop on December 12, 2013 (June 26, 2013 in Japan). This version features stereoscopic 3D and a significantly-easier difficulty setting (adding invulnerability and unlimited air).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Enable the Super Cheat Menu[CR]Begin the game and move Ecco left and right.

It frequently attempts to emulate the appearance of the Super Famicom's mode seven graphics, and is a fairly high-speed action game for the era. The game also features a fairly well developed story, presented in the form of cut-scenes between stages.[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it scores of 8,8,7,8 calling the game, \"one of the greatest combinations of hot graphics and play action\".[CR]The heroine, Annet, is controlled with the D pad. The A button is used to attack with a boomerang, the B button is used to jump, and the C button is used to cast spells. Annet can also dash quickly by holding down on the D pad and pressing the jump button.[CR]Annet has a variety of spells and tools at her disposal.The Wind Cutter spell.[CR]SPELLS: Spells consume Annet's MP bar. If Annet takes a break from using spells, her MP bar refills over time. Spells are used by pressing and holding the magic button (C). The longer the button is held, the higher the level fo the resulting spell.Fireball: The weakest spell, Annet begins with this. A simple fireball projectile which can be fired fairly rapidly. It is stronger than the basic boomerang attack.Water current: The second spell. It isn't any stronger than the fireball, but it \"flows\" forwards and downwards, and consequently take out multiple enemies or enemies in odd positions.Explosion: A powerful explosive spell which costs a lot of MP to cast.Wind Cutter: A very powerful spell that covers a wide area.Homing beam: The final spell obtained, this makes Annet fire a stream of beams from her for a period of time that target enemies.[CR]OTHER ITEMSHealing potion: These restore Annet's life.Extra boomerang: Allows Annet to throw an additional boomerang, allowing for even faster attacking.Magic stones: These reduce the damage Annet takes for a limited period.[CR]STORY[CR]In the year 1928 an evil cult calling itself the \"Hastur Group\" is attempting to summon the Lovecraftian deity Hastur to Earth. They intend to sacrifice a young woman, Restiana to achieve this, and have secretly pushed to have the Empire State Building constructed for use as a temple to accomplish this dark goal. Annet, who shares the blood of Hastur, will put a stop to all of this![CR]CHARACTERS[CR]The heroine.[CR]Annet: Originally from Peru, Annet is a 17 year old girl who was brought up in a village that worshiped Hastur. She was found and rescued by Earnest Evans and is devoted to him. She shares the blood of Hastur, granting her magical abilities. She is apparently shy around strangers.Earnest.[CR]Earnest Evans: A handsome, 31 year old archaeologist who stopped the Hastur group from summoning Hastur and rescued Annet in Peru. He adopted Annet, and she seemingly has a crush on him. He possesses a PHD in archaeology, and is obviously a homage to Harrison Ford's character Indiana Jones.[CR]Zigfried: An ex-German national who is an informant on the Hastur group's doings for Annet and Earnest. He had been a close associate of Al Capone's. There is something deeply suspicious about him.[CR]Restiana: A 17 year old girl who also shares the blood of Hastur, she is from the same village as Annet and is her rival. The group intends to sacrifice her, but they have lied to her and said she will become extremely powerful during the ritual. She doesn't particularly care, as she is trying to summon Hastur on her own, without them.[CR]Henry: The leader of the Hastur group, he is 52 years old. He is so dedicated to his cause and has done so many cruel things that he has virtually lost his humanity.[CR]Al Capone: Alphonse Gabriel Capone, the infamous gangster responsible for the Saint Valentine's Day massacre. He has been bribed to assist the Hastur group and has lobbied for the Empire State Building to be constructed. However, he turns on them and assists Annet and Earnest. Apparently he was known as \"Snorky\" to his closest friends. For some reason he was renamed \"Vincente DeMarco\" in the U.S. release.[CR]Hastur: The \"Unspeakable One\" dwells in the star Aldebaran. It is a god associated with wind on Earth, and while it is beyond such simple concepts as good and evil, its actions generally seem evil to humans.[CR]STAGES[CR]Stage 1.[CR]Stage 1: The slums of New York city! Large numbers of mafia hit men attack Annet constantly. The mafia fields a surprisingly advanced tank as the stage boss.An argument with Restiana.[CR]Stage 2: A strange valley with amusement-park like devices, apparently in South Dakota. Annet encounters and fights Restiana here.He used to clean dungeons.[CR]Stage 3: Anett starts in a liquor bootlegging operation and then enters the sewers. Silly looking giant mice and slimes swarm down there! The sewers eventually lead to a cave inhabited by club-tossing troglodytes, giant insects, and water dragons. Here Annet learns the water current spell; it is necessary to advance. The boss is a gelatinous cube.[CR]Stage 4: Annet rides the back of a dolphin to a ship waiting offshore, encountering horrible avatars of Cthulhu en route. The ship's maze-like interior is covered in spikes, and strange creatures hide in the ship. Annet finds the wind cutter here. The boss is a strange electric life form resembling some kind fibrous mass.[CR]Stage 5: Thanks to info from Al Capone, Annet heads to a temple to Hastur near the grand canyon. Various demonic creatures roam this place, and most of the statues seem to be traps. Annet finds the spell Explosion here. The boss is a foul, bubbling blue slime.[CR]Stage 6: An automobile factory in Detroit. Conveyor belts and other obstacles get in the way here. The boss appears to be a Mi-go, aka a \"fungi from yuggoth\", a race of extraterrestrial creatures from H.P. Lovecraft's writings; it plays a deadly variation of \"the shell game\", hiding in metal crates.[CR]Stage 7: An airship controlled by the Hastur group. Get inside and destroy its power source! Short and sweet.[CR]Stage 8: Return to New York! Annet must scale the Empire State Building, which is still under construction, to stop Henry from performing the ritual to summon Hastur. Of course, the building is now crawling with various demons, such a spear-wielding snake men. Annet arrives too late, however, and must do battle with Hastur itself! Is Annet strong enough to defeat a Great Old One?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Color Test[CR]As the game starts up, when the wolf team logo screen comes up hold [B]A, B, C[/B] and press [B]Up + Start[/B] to access the color test option.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Color Test[CR]Enter the following code at the Pause screen....

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Eliminate Down is a Sega Mega Drive game developed by now defunct developer  Aprinet. It was released in 1993 and solely in Japan. The game uses standard horizontal shooter mechanics but differentiates itself by offering a different level of intensity and difficult gameplay. The player must brave eight rounds of space, insect, and mechanical worlds before defeating the final enemy, each world more difficult than the last. The player is also offered three modes: easy, normal, and hard to play, as well as a scoring system for replayability. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Only two power ups are available to the ship: 'E' or energy shield and 'P' or power. The energy shield absorbs a certain amount of hits before it is destroyed, leaving the ship vulnerable to a single attack before it explodes. 'P' power ups allow the player to level their weapons. A level is gained for every 5 'P' power ups gained. There is a maximum of 3 levels that can be obtained. If the player's ship explodes, the ship will respawn with one less level than before the explosion. A ship can be sped up or slowed down by pressing Start and then pressing left or right to increase or decrease ship speed. This can be very helpful in a tight squeeze.  The ship may also take on a variety of shooting styles that will be described further in the next section.  [CR]Shooting Styles[CR] The player can choose different styles of shooting on the fly using buttons A or C (by default). These buttons can be changed in the options menu. The styles are as follows: Forward The ship fires a barrage of fire in one direction forward. This leads to maximum damage to obstacles or enemies in front of the ship, but leaves the back vulnerable to attack. An example of the backwards shooting style  Backward  The ship fires a single stream of bullets forward and sends most of its firepower backwards. As power levels increase, these shots are able to richochet off walls or obstacles. Vertical The ship fires a single stream of bullets forward while firing missles or bomblike objects up and down, effectively preventing any enemies or projectiles from striking from above or below. As levels increase, the projectiles fired by the ship are able to move along walls until an enemy or obstacle can be hit. [CR]Rounds [CR] Round 1: An outer space battle begins. The ship must overcome a line of missile launchers and defeat the first boss. Round 2: An alien battleship must be defeated.  Round 3: The ship scales a giant vertical structure and must defeat the structure's mainframe at the top.  Round 4: The ship has entered an alien world. A mechanical robot boss must be defeated.  Round 5: An electrical world that houses many strange electrical enemies including a long-armed electrostatic mini-boss and a mechanical boss.  Round 6: The ship must battle a gigantic eye monster.  Round 7: The ship must battle a giant green brained monster with dangerous claws.  Round 8: The final battle over a planet that closely resembles Earth. The final boss takes on two forms and must be fought twice.     [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Weapon Cheat[CR]On the title screen, press A, B, Right, Left, Right, Left, Down, Down, Up, Up on Controller 1.  You should hear a confirmation sound. After starting the game, press Button A on Controller 2 to cycle through different weapon types and Button B on Controller 2 to cycle through the powerup levels.",

The screen doesn't transition to an overhead view while fielding, unlike many other baseball games. Along with the traditional tournament and exhibition modes, the player can try their hand at a Home Run Derby and receives a score based on how many homers they hit.[CR]ESPN Baseball Tonight was originally released on the Sega CD in 1993. It received additional versions for the core Sega Genesis system, the Super Nintendo and PC MS-DOS, all in 1994. It would be followed by other ESPN-branded sports games, the next being ESPN Sunday Night NFL in August 1994.[CR]",

Standing in his way is the terrorist organization E.Y.E., which is determined to bring down ESWAT at any cost with equivalent hi-tech gear.[CR]The game changes as the player progresses, evolving from the moderately underpowered patrolman to the ESWAT cyborg and adopting new weaponry and powers along the way. The game plays similarly to other Sega side-scrolling games of the era, such as Shinobi.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level select[CR]Start a game, the Hero and Mission screen appears.

The game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handle by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the top of the screen.[CR]Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, dominant hand and stats emphasis. Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.[CR]During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.[CR]Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them.

It was originally released as XZR II for the MSX2, PC-88 and PC-98 computer platforms in 1988.[CR]Exile received a full 16-bit remake in 1991, featuring cutscenes and a brand new Red Book soundtrack. Renovation Products handled the Genesis version, whereas Working Designs localized the Turbo CD version. The dungeons were less difficult to navigate in the 16-bit versions; the original MSX2 version's were maze-like, so it was easier to lose one's way. The game's soundtrack was composed by Shinobu Ogawa and Tenpei Sato.[CR]Like its predecessor, the gameplay contains heavy drug use, with drugs being used instead of potions. These drugs, however, have side-effects, such as stat and health abnormalities and sometimes even death. Many of these drug references were censored for the North American releases, however.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In a war-torn Middle-Eastern land ravaged by a century of religious Crusades, a force of evil has emerged to prey on the weak and defenseless people. As Sadler, a battle-hardened veteran of the Holy Wars, you have answered the call to defend the people and rid the once peaceful land of the dreaded \"Masters of Evil\".[CR]The plot of the game detailed the further adventures of Sadler, taking place after the events of XZR. Now living in the time of the Christian Crusades, Sadler makes an attempt to unite the world under one God and achieve world peace. Along the way, he performs several rituals and fights various Hindu and Buddhist deities.[CR]Sadler meets the head of the Knights Templar, Hugues de Payens, and helps him search for the Holimax, a holy artefact. Sadler travels to several different countries, including France (where his love interest Rumi is kidnapped), India, Cambodia, and Japan. In a Cambodian temple, Sadler resurrects the Persian Manichaean prophet Mani. In Japan, Sadler rescues Ninkan, who in real life was head of Japanese sex cult Tachikawa-ryu. Afterwards, Sadler travels back in time to Eden and meets Bacchus. Sadler also murders Hiram Abiff, a Masonic figure. After defeating Jubelum of the Three Ruffians, Sadler receives the Holimax.[CR]Although the console versions end there, the computer versions continue the story, having Sadler warp to present-day Manhattan, where he fights skateboarding punks and zombies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the TG-CD version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 7,8,7,7, adding, \"...Working Designs has established a reputation for quality software, and this disc demonstrates how good a CD RPG can be. This quest is challenging and not linear as some of the newer ones are\".[CR]",

The \"Circus\" part of the title is actually a mistranslation of the word Circuit. The view is top-down which is considered a tricky view for most gamers[4]. Players must try to either win as many races as possible or achieve a podium finish. Every new Grand Prix at worldly destinations like the Canadian Grand Prix and the Japanese Grand Prix requires the player to learn new skills and new turns. The racing action consists of open wheel vehicles capable of going more than 200 miles per hour (321.8 kilometres per hour) on the long straight portions of the track.[CR]While loosely based on the 1991 Formula One season, the game uses drivers and racing teams with similar names to the officially licensed counterparts of that era. Career mode only permits racers to race up to eight seasons; retirement is mandatory after the eighth season. Preparing for each and every indvidual race requires setting up the right racing parts for the individual demands of that particular course (all of them are road courses with no oval courses as seen in the actual Formula One league). Team Lotus is considered to be the official co-sponsor of this video game along with its publisher Nichibutsu.[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_Circus_MD[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test Menu[CR]To access the sound test menu, press and hold A + B + C + START at the title screen.",

If a team correctly guesses all the answers, or correctly guesses one answer after the other family has given an incorrect answer three times, they win the round.[CR]These particular versions were all published by GameTek for various systems, but were functionally similar. The first game to be published by GameTek was the 1991 version for the NES, which was developed by Beam Software (which has since been rebranded as Krome Studios Melbourne). The SNES and Genesis versions were released in October 1993, developed by Imagineering Inc and Eurocom Entertainment Software respectively. The 3DO version from 1994 was also developed by Eurocom Entertainment Software -- this version used digitized actors and clips from the show.[CR]This Family Feud is not to be confused with the many other games that have had that title, a complete list of which can be found on the Family Feud franchise page.[CR]",

The musical notes on the paper float away, captured by the win! Mickey, do something! And Mickey does? He follows the notes in his dream, rising into the air and drifting after them.  But is Mickey too late? The tricky wind scatters the notes throughout Fantasia. It drops a few in the master's workroom, and loses others in the ancient jungles and under the sea. Some notes fall into deep, dark caverns. Many of the notes are scattered about in the garden's and meadows, where mushrooms skip. And far, far into the land of Fantasia, even more of the notes drift among airy columns, between floating bubbles, flying horses, and hippo's dancing on their toes. Take care, Mickey.

                "plot": "Dizzy's cartoon adventure in Zakeria - a magical kingdom ruled by the evil wizard Zaks. Explore the mysterious diamond mines, fabulous caverns, dragon's lair, cloud castle, find secret treasure maps, encounter strange magicians, wizards, trolls, pirates, leprechauns and many other weird and wonderful creatures.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]- Characters -[CR]Fantastic Dizzy contains all of the characters in the series, 16 in total. While most of the Yolkfolk were harmed by Zaks, others have other problems. Other characters include Good Wizard Theodore, which grant an extra life to Dizzy if he completes his puzzle, Blackheart the Pirate, who has his ship docked in Keldor, the Palace Guard, who lets Dizzy get inside the city if he bargains with him, Prince Clumsy, looking for a princess, Rockwart the Troll, Shamus the Leprechaun and the Shop Owner.[CR]- Locations -[CR]There are several places for Dizzy to visit, including the whole complex of the Yolkfolk secret treehouse, with its lifts and houses, the mine, where a dragon lives, the neighbour city of Keldor, where the Pirate ship and the Castle are, the grasslands, Carber Bay, the cemetery (including inside a grave) and finally Zaks' Cloud Castle.[CR]The game engine is able to scroll horizontally, but most areas do not scroll vertically. As soon as Dizzy climbs a ladder or jumps to an off-screen platform, new screens are loaded to memory. It is also able to render day and night cycles and also rain (which gives Dizzy a sad face).[CR]- Concept -[CR]The game is hard to qualify in a genre: while it seems at first a platform game, Dizzy is vulnerable to all enemies while unable to eliminate them, and puzzles are completed by bringing an object to a location (in the same fashion as Gods and adventure games), and also has to capture all 250 stars scattered in the game. The game can also be seen as a union of all the previous games where user can find a lot of familiar puzzles (e.g. Elevators, magic beans) and places (e.g. mines, deep sea) as well has several arcade minigames based on older games in the series (like Bubble Dizzy).[CR]- Stars -[CR]Scattered around the game world are 100 or 250 stars (depends on version) which must be collected to grant access to the final confrontation with Zaks. While most of them are accessible in the regular parts of the game, others are placed inside the minigames, which forces the player to run through them as many times needed to get all stars. If the player tries to reach the tower without the stars, Dizzy is stunned by the electric door. This element of the game is similar to the Super Mario Series.[CR]- Objects -[CR]To complete the game, Dizzy has to carry items (three at a maximum) like keys and objects to be used to solve puzzles like a match, a weight or cymbals to certain spots in the game. Some objects are not meant to be traded, given to another characters or placed, but used to reach other destinations (like the rope, the swimfins or the aqua-lung) or to protect from danger (the umbrella). This element is similar to the game Puggsy, also released for Sega.[CR]- Minigames -[CR]While most of the game is passed in the slower platform sections, there are three minigames required to complete it, plus one to get all the stars.[CR]    - Mine carts: Dizzy can travel in the carts found in the mine into other places in the game, collecting stars along the way. There are a number of dangers in the rails, from falling rocks, dead ends and carts in the opposite direction. Nearing the end, both cart speed and number of dead ends increase.[CR]    - Dizzy Down the Rapids: Some versions of Fantastic Dizzy feature a section where Dizzy must ride a barrel down a river avoiding a pursuing troll and several natural hazards while riding surface currents and attempting to collect stars. This minigame is omitted from several versions, including the Mega Drive/Genesis and PC releases.[CR]    - Castle Capers: A minigame based on the Operation Wolf concept, Dizzy, armed with a crossbow, has to get a 5 hit advantage over the trolls, who are occupying the castle. However, if the trolls get the same advantage, Dizzy loses a life.[CR]    - Bubble Trouble: Dizzy has to reach a small island before his oxygen wears out. To do so, he has to ride air bubbles formed in the sea bed, and jumping into the platforms in the sides or other bubbles before they burst. Larger bubbles endure more, but are slower, while smaller ones are fast but burst shortly after Dizzy rides them. This minigame was adapted into a standalone title, called Bubble Dizzy however due to further development required on Fantastic Dizzy and Dizzy Down the Rapids, Bubble Dizzy was released November 1990.[CR]    - Theodore's magic puzzle: The extra life minigame is a regular 4x4 shuffling puzzle, which has to be completed in inside a time limit. As the number of lives increase, so does the complexity of the puzzles.[CR]- Lives -[CR]Dizzy can be harmed by all enemies in the game, but also by staying underwater for too long without an aqua-lung. He also dies immediately on contact with some parts of the game which require an object to be safely traversed, such as the spikes at ground level in the Yolkfolk tree house or the plant near his house or some other parts in the game where Dizzy isn't supposed to go. While he is unharmed by butterflies of any kind of falls, he becomes dazed and can be harmed by a rat or a snail in a potentially dangerous situation. In some versions contact with a butterfly caused Dizzy to move in reverse to the player's input for a short time. Fruit restores some of Dizzy's health, while a gemstone clears the damage gauge.[CR]- Dead ends -[CR]It is possible to reach a dead end in the game if, for instance :[CR]    - The rope is dropped at a platform that can only be reached with it.[CR]    - The fire to save Denzil is started at the wrong place. (As a consequence, Denzil cannot be saved, you don't get the flippers and so on.)[CR]    - If the crossbow is left inside the trolls' castle, but there was something that still needed to be done (e.g. picking up all the stars and the bridge building kit inside)[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Extra life ??-[CR]Pause the game and press C, Right, A, B, B, A, Left, Left, Start - Extra Life (note: this can only be used once per game)[CR]- Hidden menu -[CR]At title screen press Right, Up, B, A, Down, Up, B, Down, Up, B - Hidden Menu[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Dizzy[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/console/genesis/home/586175.html[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury (also known as Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, and known in Japan as Legend of the Hungry Wolf: The Battle of Destiny), is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on December 20, 1991.The first fighting game released for the Neo Geo (and the first fighting game developed by SNK), Fatal Fury was designed as a spiritual successor to the original Street Fighter (by its creator, Takashi Nishiyama). Developed around the same time as Street Fighter II (and released a half a year later), Fatal Fury introduced a special \"dual line\" system (where most stages allow players to fight between the foreground and the background areas). It also introduced the concept of team fights (as a second player joining in must help the first player defeat their opponent before the versus match begins) and mid-match stage changes (changing either the time of day or the weather). The game would later receive numerous sequels throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle.Set in the fictional American city of South Town, Fatal Fury follows American martial artist Terry Bogard, his younger Ninjitsu brother Andy Bogard, and their Japanese Muay Thai kick boxer friend Joe Higashi as they enter the \"King of Fighters\" tournament (which is not to be confused with the tournaments in the King of Fighters game series) to seek revenge on its sponsor: underworld crime boss Geese Howard.[CR]The game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (removing the dual line system, team fights, and bonus rounds) and the Genesis (removing two opponents) during 1993, both by Takara. These ports made the other characters playable but removed or changed some of the other features (both versions removing the standard bonus rounds and team fights, the SNES version removing the dual line system, and the Genesis version removing some opponents) Other ports during that era include the Sharp X68000 (on May 21, 1993 for Japan only) and the Neo Geo CD (by SNK on September 9, 1994). The original version was also included in two compilations: Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 1 (for the PlayStation 2) and SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 (for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Wii) compilations, and was digitally released for the Wii (via the Virtual Console on September 21, 2007), PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network on December 21, 2010, later made available for the PlayStation Vita).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury plays like a traditional fighting game. The player has three attack buttons: Punch, Kick, and Throw. Each character have special moves whose input commands are shown during the course of the game (after every bonus round) as opposed to being given in an instruction card in the game's cabinet.The game introduced a unique and novel fighting game concept to the franchise: that fighters can fight on two different areas (known as \"lines\" or \"planes\") instead of just one. This allows characters to dodge attacks and projectiles completely rather than block them. While this was heavily expanded in later games, this game does not allow the player character to freely move among the lines. Instead, the player character can knock the opponent to the other area and follow up with a quick roll or a jump kick. Some stages have only one area, with the other area blocked off by obstacles (in which knocking the opponent into the obstacles bounce them back to the main area).After every two matches, the player is allowed to participate in a bonus round in which they arm wrestle a machine by mashing the Punch button as fast as possible.Fatal Fury is the only fighting game in the series where if a second player joins in the middle of a fight, the fight is not interrupted so that the two players could battle. Instead, before the actual versus battle takes place, both players fight the CPU opponent in a two-on-one fight.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Despite there being 11 total fighters in this fighting game, only three are playable in the arcade version. The other fighters are only playable on the SNES and Genesis ports in their Versus Modes only (although the SNES version only allowed the second player to play as the other players).Hwa Jai and Billy Kane are not included as fighters in the Genesis port. Instead, the matches against the second and fourth initial opponents in the campaign are first \"interrupted\" with match against one of the other remaining protagonists.Playable CharactersTerry BogardAndy BogardJoe HigashiCPU Opponents[CR]After initially choosing one of the three protagonists, players must then choose their first opponent to fight:Duck KingRichard MeyerMichael MaxTung Fu Rue[CR]Defeating their first opponent then cycles them through the other three initial fighters.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury 2 (known in Japan as Legend of the Hungry Wolf 2: The New Battle) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on March 5, 1993.The second installment of the Fatal Fury series, Fatal Fury 2 heavily improves the fighting mechanics of the original (including a traditional control layout with four basic attack buttons, the ability to move freely between fighting areas with special commands, and a less restricted character roster) while introducing some mechanics from Art of Fighting (including dashing and powerful situational super moves). A major update to the game, titled Fatal Fury Special, was released later in the year.Set after the death of crime boss Geese Howard in the original Fatal Fury, a new worldwide \"King of Fighters\" tournament is held by mysterious German nobleman Wolfgang Krauser seeking the fighter responsible for the defeat. Along with the three original protagonists (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi), players can pick one of five new fighters to progress through the tournament, including Japanese ninja Mai Shiranui, Korean taekwondo master Kim Kaphwan, and Australian wrestler Big Bear (formerly Raiden from the previous game).Along with the standard Neo Geo CD port (by SNK on September 9, 1994), the game received a worldwide port to both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis in 1994 by TAKARA. Japan-exclusive ports were also released for the Sharp X68000, PC Engine CD-ROM\u00b2 (requiring the Arcade Card add-on), and Game Boy (where all characters are redone in a \"super deformed\" style). The original Neo Geo version was also included in the Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1 compilation for the PlayStation 2 and was digitally released for the Wii (via the Wii Virtual Console) on June 30, 2008. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Neo Geo's Four Button Configuration Unlike the previous game, Fatal Fury 2 now makes full use of the Neo Geo's four-button configuration by removing the dedicated throw button and separating the Punch and Kick buttons to Light and Strong. Throws are now performed by holding forwards or backwards on the joystick while both fighters are close and pressing Strong Punch.New techniques to the series include dashing backwards (by tapping backwards on the joystick twice), crouch walking forwards (by holding down+forward on the joystick), and taunting (by pressing Strong Punch from afar). Also new are \"Defensive Attacks\", which allows players to counter-attack a whiffed attack by holding forward and pressing Light Punch while blocking, and \"Desperation Attacks\", powerful super moves that can only be executed when the player's life gauge is nearly depleted (as indicated by a flashing red life gauge).The \"dual line\" fighting system from the original Fatal Fury also applies to the game. However, players can now move freely among lines. When both players are in the same line, pressing both Light Punch and Light Kick simultaneously lets the player jump to the opposite line. From there, either player can follow up by performing a special attack (by pressing either Punch or Kick button with certain joystick combinations) or by rolling harmlessly (by pressing either Up or Down on the joystick). Players can also knock other players into the opposite line with a \"Strong Attack\" (by pressing both Strong Punch and Strong Kick simultaneously). Only the first three boss characters have \"one-line\" stages with obstacles.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury 2 contains eight playable characters and four CPU-only boss characters, which can only be playable in the SNES, Genesis, and Game Boy versions with a cheat code. Much like the Street fighter 2, Fatal Fury 2 made a point of picking fighters from around the world, selecting many different nations for fighters to represent. Fatal Fury 2 was notable for introducing popular characters Mai Shiranui, and Kim Kapwhan. These characters would go on to become regulars in the popular King of Fighters Series.CharacterNationalityList of Special MovesStageTerry Bogard AmericanPower WaveBurn KnuckleRising TackleCrack ShootPower Geyser* Andy BogardAmericanShadow SliceRising Dragon PunchSonic SplitFlying CrunchChoReppadan* Joe HigashiJapaneseSlash KickTNT PunchTiger KickHurricane UpperScrew Upper* Mai ShiranuiJapaneseCherry DreamDragon Flame FandangoDeadly Ninja BeesButterfly FanSquirrel AttackCho Hisatsu Shinobibachi* Kim KaphwanSouth KoreanFlying SliceMoon Cresent SlashFlying KickHouou Kyaku*Big Bear AustraliaGiant BombSuper Drop KickFire Breath* Jubei YamadaJapaneseNihon Seoi DashBody DropCookie CutterDynamite Izuna OtoshiCheng Sinzan TaiwanTempest BlastBelly BlastBone Crusher blastBakuri Hoh*[CR]Unplayable Boss Character[CR]In the MVS version of Fatal Fury 2 the boss characters are unplayable.

Your World War II era biplane has been modified to shoot lasers and drop powerful bombs. [CR]There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock you from the sky. [CR]In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and maintenance.  You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.[CR]There are also many power-ups available in each level.  Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes.  Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed.  These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.[CR]The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot.  As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16.  The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.[CR]The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire.  It will fire continuously while the fire button is held.  Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Test Mode[CR]Pause the game, then press [B]Up, A, Down, B, Left, C, Right, Start[/B]. Here you can manage your weapon.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flashback: The Quest for Identity is a sci-fi 2D action-adventure platform game in the style of Delphine's earlier Out of This World. Like Out of This World, the game's most notable feature is its use of rotoscoped animation, which allowed for extremely fluid representation of the main character's actions, like running, jumping, climbing, rolling, turning, drawing his gun and shooting.[CR]The game was originally released for the Commodore Amiga, a home computer very popular in Delphine's native France. It was ported to MS-DOS, SNES, Genesis, Atari Jaguar and the Acorn Archimedes the following year. In 1994 a CD-ROM version was created and released on the Sega CD, CD-ROM, CD-i, 3DO and FM Towns. Many of the ports were developed in part or wholly by Tiertex.[CR]Flashback was followed by a 1995 sequel, Fade to Black. It was also remade in 2013 as Flashback. The original has also been rereleased on several systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Flashback starts off with the main character, Conrad B. Hart, being chased by some armed men who openly fire their weapons at him. After being chased for down a corridor Conrad commandeers some sort of flying motorbike and escapes the complex he was in. The men give chase however in a much larger ship and eventually catch up and shoot Conrad out of the sky. They search the crash area for a brief time but fly off either believing Conrad was dead or just unable to find his body.AmnesiaFlashback features rotoscoped cutscenes.[CR]Conrad awakens the next day in an alien jungle on a planet known as Titan. It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.[CR]A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game.Employment[CR]With his memories restored Conrad decides he needs to return to Earth. With little money however, this was never going to be as easy as it sounds. Ian suggests that Conrad should take part in a TV Show where he must fight Cyborgs for a chance to win a ticket to Earth. As it would be too dangerous to compete under his own name Conrad has to get false ID papers. Ian sends him to a contact named Jack, who demands 1,500 credits for the papers. Since he doesn't have that sort of cash on hand Conrad partakes in multiple odd jobs available in New Washington.[CR]First he is hired by Titan Spaces Lines for an apparently easy job of collecting and delivering a parcel. Just outsides the parcels destination he is attacked by a member of the NWPD but overcomes him and delivers the package.[CR]The second mission comes from Virtual Crop that requests Conrad escort a VIP to their research center. It is made clear that the mission will require a firearm ad the area traveled in will be dangerous. The warning is well advised since mutants infest the area in addition to malfunctioning Security Spheres. Like previously though Conrad succeeds.[CR]Titan TV hires Conrad for the third mission. They report that a Model Cy-Borg 2.1 has escaped with the possible assistance of an outsider. It carries a virus which could spread to all other functioning cyborgs. A police officer informs Conrad that the Cy-Borg wants to make a deal. This turns out to be a trap however and Conrad kills the Police Officer for access to 2.1\u2019s lair. Once in his hideout Conrad eliminates 2.1.[CR]The penultimate New Washington mission is accomplished for Titan Senior Advisory Board. Sabotage to the generator that supplies power to New Washington means the city is on the verge of blowing up. Conrad has 90 seconds to locate the sabotaged area and repair it. With only seconds left Conrad repairs the generator and saves New Washington.[CR]With only one mission required to gain the necessary credits for the false papers, another party hires Conrad to eliminate the mutant threat that is lurking in all the Restricted Areas. After accomplishing this task Conrad meets Jack one more time who now hands over the papers allowing entry into the game show.[CR]The game show of requires participants to fight their way through eight different levels of deadly situations. Littered throughout every level are Cy-Borg 2.1s, Sentry Spheres and mines. Conrad manages to fight through all levels and win a ticket to Earth.Back on EarthEarth[CR]Conrad believes The Morphs have a hidden base within a night club on Earth but upon arrival is attacked by the local law enforcement and security measures. After some time he locates the nightclub. He breaks in through an upper level thus causing more security measures to become active making his job of finding the Morphs more complicated.[CR]After much tribulation Conrad finds himself in a vent shaft above a group of Morphs that are discussing their plans. They reveal that soon their invasion will begin since millions of their kind are ready to teleport in and destroy humanity. Conrad\u2019s vent then proceeds to collapse under his weight and he is discovered. It is decided that he will be thrown into the dungeon with plans for interrogation.[CR]After he wakes up in his cell Conrad discovers he is unarmed and that Cy-Borgs have been sent to his cell to carry out the interrogation. Unexpectedly though Conrad makes a quick burst for the door and evades the Cy-Borgs. Luckily enough his gun was not too far away and he is able to destroy his would-be interrogators. Further into their lair Conrad finally confronts the Morphs in combat. With their ability to take and lose shape whenever they want Conrad has a difficult time but overcomes everyone he meets. With the realization that the Morph invasion is close with no time to report it, Conrad teleports to the Morph home planet with the intention of stopping their conquest.[CR]On the planet Conrad tries to assist a human prisoner who is in possession of explosives. Unfortunately the man is killed by a Morph upon his release but lives long enough to give Conrad the destructive device. Conrad discovers a diary on the planet that reveals a captive human scientist managed to enter the theory of molecular research into a Titan computer. This theory was taken up by Conrad who made glasses revealing the aliens living among the human population. It is also revealed that The Master Brain, positions at the center of the planet, controls all morphs, destroying him will end the race. The device Conrad holds was created by the scientist and is powerful enough to destroy the entire planet.[CR]With other options being non-existent, Conrad decides to put the scientist's plan into action. He travels all the way into the planet\u2019s core. After battling more Morphs the Master Brain is killed. After dropping the Atomic Charge into the foundations of the planet Conrad races against time to escape the planet in a docked ship before the planet explodes.[CR]Conrad only just makes it, with the ship just out of reach from the destructive force of the Atomic Device. Conrad soon learns though that he is in a galaxy unrecognized by the ship\u2019s systems. With the possibility of being lost in space forever Conrad places himself in cryogenic suspension to be awakened if he is ever discovered.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 9,9,9,8 in addition to the Editor's Choice Gold award. They added, \"...one of the best games ever made for the Genesis. The action is non-stop, and it really feels like you're playing a movie!...get a joystick, because the generic Sega controllers aren't precise enough to handle the diagonal motions necessary for some of the specialized techniques\".[CR]",

Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the \"recipes\" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. [CR]Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies.

The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  [CR]The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.[CR]First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.[CR]A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.[CR]Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.[CR]Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.[CR]Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]When are you are on the number of players screen, hold down C, then press Right nine times, while still holding C, press A or B to increase or decrease the level.

The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle![CR]Unlike most Japanese adventures, \"Fushigi no Umi no Nadia\" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.[CR]Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!",

In arcades, the game was released in three cabinet variants; a standard standup version, a sit-down version and the custom sitdown R-360 cabinet. The R-360 was able to rotate freely on two axes, allowing the cabinet to mimic in-game action, including turning the cabinet completely upside down. Due to the impressiveness of the R-360 cabinet the home computer versions (Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Amiga) were named G-LOC R360.[CR]Some ports of the game included features not present in the arcade version. For instance the Mega Drive / Genesis version alternates between first and third-person perspectives, the Master System port features bosses and the Game Gear port allows the player to spend points earned while playing to upgrade the jet.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls an experimental aircraft in timed missions - the player earns more time and advances stages by achieving goals that are set in each stage. During the course of the game the player is attacked from both the front and the back by enemy aircraft. The player controls the aircraft with a joystick and has two weapons: a cannon and missiles. The player can either try to gun down enemy planes or attempt to gain missile lock by moving the crosshair over them. The game is played mostly from a first person perspective, however once locked on to by an enemy the perspective changes to third person (behind the player's aircraft) to allow for evasive manoeuvers.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Michael Jackson owned an R-360 deluxe cabinet of this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest 8 meg cartridges for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Gaiares is a horizontal shooter developed by Nippon Telenet. Released on December 26th, 1990 in Japan, it was later brought to U.S. markets by way of publisher Renovation. Other than being fairly difficult, Gaiares is most known for its unique weapon-leeching mechanic. Instead of relying on traditional power-ups as shooters usually do, your option-like ship (called TOZ) can be launched outward toward enemy craft with the C button, bringing back one of many weapons for your ship to use. To expand on this feature, the game also features three power-levels to these weapons; this allows you to leech from the same type of enemy multiple times, to increase it's power.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game also dons minimally animated anime-styled cutscenes with dialog at the beginning and end of the game, which serve purpose to the player, and provide a satisfying conclusion to the mayhem. The back of the box can tell it best:[CR]\"Mother Earth has been turned into an environmental wasteland by careless humans: Now, the human race has one last chance to save the Earth...with your help.[CR]The United Star Cluster of Leezaluth, the governing empire of the Galaxy, has sent a warning to the Earth: \"To any surviving Humans--An inter-galactic terrorist group known as Gulfer--led by Queen Zz Badnusty--is planning to invade your planet and use your polluted waste to build weapons. You Humans must stop Gulfer, or we will be forced to super-nova your sun and destroy the earth to stop them. But if you can stop Gulfer, we will give you a new planet like Earth to live on.\"[CR]Unfortunately, Earth can no longer afford to maintain a standing army or military. But there is still one brave hero willing to fight for the survival of Earth. He is Dan Dare, a young ace-pilot. Alexis, the messenger from Leezaluth, was awed by Dan's fighting spirit and decided to stay with him. She modified Dan's spacecraft and is no the navigator of the TOZ weapon system on Dan's ship.[CR]The last epic struggle for the survival of the Human Race and Mother Earth has just begun...all our fates rest in your hands.\"[CR]Visuals[CR]Graphically, Gaiares is heavy on the parallax-scrolling. Each mission has multiple stages, and the environment will change as you traverse through it. Environmental hazards are a plenty, with guillotines, black holes that pull you in, and narrow tunnels filled with swarms of enemies for you to navigate your ship through. There is usually a sub-boss before the actual boss (or several), which serves as a nice warm-up before you encounter these massive sprites. Each mission boss is a hulking beast that takes up the entire screen, which was quite impressive for the time.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Featuring 13 weapons in total, most of the excitement regarding the weapons comes from actually discovering how to obtain them. Most of them are on certain types of enemies, but a few require special conditions to get. You'll likely stumble upon one or two of these by accident, and won't know how you got them. The top-left edge of the screen shows both the name of the weapon you have equipped, and the power level it currently has.[CR]Fire your weapon with the B button, you can hold it down and the fire will repeat indefinitely. Your TOZ works as an Option-like ship in this game, and will fire bullets alongside you. The TOZ plays heavily into some of the powered-up weapon attacks. Your ship will always fire a missiles diagonally.I-Vulcan (Ionic Vulcan)[CR]The I-Vulcan is the default weapon in Gaiares. It's always listed as \"Normal\" on the HUD, but when you leech an upgrade of it off an enemy, it'll say the name for a brief moment. This weapon is usually found on tiny, early-level enemies of no significance. Keep in mind that if you have another weapon equipped, you can't leech back the default weapon. This fires one straight shot at level 1, and can upgrade to three shots at level 3.P-Cannon (Plasma Cannon)[CR]The P-Cannon shoots balls of energy in several directions from you and the TOZ, the amount of which will depend on your weapon level. At level 3, it shoots behind you and your TOZ in addition.G-Beam (Giga Beam)[CR]Too put it simply, the G-Beam is a big ass laser beam. It gets bigger depending on level, and your TOZ will shoot one as well at level 3.S-Laser (Somersault Laser)[CR]The S-Laser fires multiple homing lasers simultaneously, and these will track anywhere on screen where an enemy is. This means that those sneaky top and back entering enemies can't get the jump on you.T-Missile (Tektite Missile)[CR]The T-Missle at level 1 appears to be a single straight-firing missile, but when leveled up, both you and your TOZ are firing missiles in all four directions, making the distinct \"t-shape\" the name obviously spawned from.H-Laser (Horizontal Laser)[CR]The H-Laser fires a thin concentrated beam at enemy ships, and when fully leveled up, your TOZ gets one, and they increase in width.V-Laser (Vertical Laser)[CR]The V-Laser is a good defensive weapon as it shoots out a vertical wall of light, eating up enemy projectiles and ships while it's at it. This weapon seems to be one of the more powerful in the game, especially for a normal weapon that can be captured regularly. At max level, your option helps out, and the vertical beam is taller, covering more area.R-Collidere (Rolling Colador)[CR]The R stands for rotation, as two bullets on either side of your ship will fire, and will change trajectory in a 360 degree pattern. This means if you hold the fire button down, you will have bullets covering every direction on the screen, albeit not all at once. At level 3, it's increased to 4 simultaneous directions, and your TOZ gets one of his own. This one is a pretty particular catch, so don't expect to run into this weapon a lot.E-Smash (Energy Smash)[CR]This weapon features a shield mechanic. By holding down the fire button (B) a circular pattern of energy orbs will swirl around your ship, protecting you from incoming projectiles and ships that brush up against you. At max level, your TOZ gets one as well. You can release the B button after holding for a period, to launch all the orbs forward. There are a couple areas where this is pretty much required, as you'll be surrounded around enemies and unable to maneuver in an enclosed space.F-Formation[CR]One of the four hidden weapons, score in multiples of 10,000 points. Deploy your TOZ onto an enemy when the last 4 digits on your scoreboard are all '0' (such as 10,000, 40,000, 450,000, 1,250,000, etc). As with all the secret weapons, there are no upgrades for it, you start with the maximum potential of this weapon. Your TOZ will split into 5, and they'll swarm around like bees shooting large orange projectiles with high rate of fire.T-Vulcan[CR]Hidden weapon no. 2, you have to deploy the TOZ and leech an enemy 128 times. It doesn't have to be consecutive times without missing, and it doesn't have to be a new weapon or level-up every time. On the 129th capture, you will receive T-Vulcan (probably towards the last stage of the game, as 128 is a lot of times). This will fire a 7-way split of bullets at an obtuse angle in front of your ship, taking up a fair deal of the screen retail with its bullets.A-Bullet[CR]The A-Bullet is a secret weapon with a very specific unlock. At the beginning of the game, you must pause and unpause the game rapidly, for a total of 8 pause screens. Afterward, deploy the TOZ at an object that is not an enemy (the first being the enemy clear powerup on mission 1). This is fully powered up upon obtaining it, it fires a gigantic bullet/missile that deals significant damage. It's important to note that this can only be obtained once per gameplay session.T-Braster[CR]At any time you have the default weapon (I-Vulcan) you can obtain this hidden weapon. Fire the TOZ into empty space and allow it to return to you 6 times. Make sure you don't accidentally capture an enemies weapon during this or it won't work. After, fire it a 7th time, this time capturing an enemy weapon. That weapon will be T-Braster. The weapon is fully powered up upon receiving it, and it fires balls of energy in a spread formation from your TOZ, which go nuts flying all over the screen, when ever there are enemies for it to home into. A good trick to pull out in the clinch when you've just died on a stage and aren't satisfied with the weapons in the area. This weapon will disappear upon mission completion.[CR]Other Upgrades[CR]In addition to weapon upgrades, you can level up two other things in this game. The first of which is your Quark Missile, which automatically fires alongside any given weapon. To start, you have one missile that fires diagonally downward. After upgrading, you will then fire two missiles, both of which will home in on the enemy. To do this, you have to use your TOZ to capture this power on certain grounded enemies, usually gun/turret looking things.[CR]The other upgradable item comes in the form of a power-up, called Break Defender. The power-up itself offers you a shield, which gives you 3 hits of vitality on the ship instead of your usual one. BUT, if you toss the TOZ at the power-up, it'll \"level it up\" in a sense. After, pick up the power-up and you'll find that you have 5 points of vitality. This isn't anywhere visibly on the HUD, you'll just have to take the hits and find out for yourself.[CR]Missions[CR]The game features 8 multi-staged Missions, taking you over a variety of environments beyond the typical space shooter. Expect tunnels, under water sequences, environmental traps, temples, and all sorts of cool looking stuff.Mission 1[CR]This mission starts after a cutscene, and has a non-controllable sequence involving launching your ship and its faithful TOZ companion into space. The mission is relatively easy and is considered a primer for things to come. This stage features some large asteroids, a sub-boss (which you can steal a weapon from) and a giant anime robot for a first boss, named the \"Steel Valkyrie\". One of the \"oh shit\" moments a child would have playing this game is seeing this first boss.Mission 2[CR]A quick change of scenery descends you into the atmosphere of an icy planet, blasting ships right out of the gate. The sub-boss is a serpent creature in this level, and you can steal the fantastic V-Laser by attaching your TOZ to his head. This can prove to be difficult as he moves around the screen like a game of centipede, but it's worth it. Afterward, head underwater and prepare for battle as you fight what appears to be a clamshell with guns mounted on it. Once you deal significant damage, the shell opens to reveal a giant robot mermaid, who of course is still mounted with guns.Mission 3[CR]Another non-controllable sequence of coolness leads you into this level, and immediately you're dropped into the first of two sub-boss battles (you read it right). After defeating this foe, you head into the deepest reaches of space, where black holes wait to foil your plans, and suck you in. You have to fly against resistance here, and also worry about space lightning strikes (go figure). Then you head through a space temple filled with all sorts of booby traps, like spikes coming from the ground/ceiling, wrecking balls swinging like pendulums, and even giant space guillotines. At the end you encounter a giant reaper-like creature, appropriately named \"Death Ghetto\". He changes things up by teleporting behind your ship, firing sickles at you for a period of time before teleporting again. The T-Missiles come in handy here if you have them powered up, as they shoot backwards.Mission 4[CR]You begin in a debris field, forced to swiftly navigate through junk and enemies alike. After, you have a split path top or bottom, which lead to the same point ultimately, but has significantly different routes there. You will encounter different enemies/weapons on each of these branches, so experiment and see which one suits. You encounter several large non-boss enemies, that have shields and pose a serious threat. Eventually you find your way to a tunnel, where you're trapped and forced to fight a tunnel snake. You don't have to defeat him, and it's hard to get clean shots on him. After a while, you can advance to the boss, which is frankly...indescribable. It hovers around the screen in a counter-clockwise fashion as he chases you, shooting energy rays at you that you can dodge. There is a core in the center which you'll want to hit.Mission 5[CR]This is where the game gets serious in terms of difficulty. Mission 5 is a planet that is both fire and ice based, and you face hazards regarding both. On top, ice chunks will fall and damage your ship, and on bottom, fireballs leap out of the lava pit, combined with enemy gunfire for you to avoid. You can shoot the fireballs to split them into several smaller pieces, but you're better off avoiding them. After combating the sub-boss inbetween both of these hazards, you come to a giant space dragon. A good defensive weapon like V-Laser is good here, as it'll thwart both the hand missiles and the energy shooting from his eyes. His weak point seems to be the neck region.Mission 6[CR]Mission 6 takes you to the Gulfer base, and features several mini-bosses from past stages to contend with. At the end, you fight a shield-wielding female robot warrior. She fires waves of light from her shield, and presses you towards the wall at which point she tries to stab you with her sword. The more you damage her, the harder it will be to dodge her attacks as they get more involved. The sword swipe begins to shoot energy that splits into 3, making it hard to out-maneuver. Ideally you want to hit her face region, but that's hard to do with a shield in front of her the whole time.Mission 7[CR]Further into Gulfer base, it's now time for the boss gauntlet. As with any classic game of the late 80's and early 90's, they throw every previous boss you've fought up until this point in this level. The bosses have updated patterns and are generally more aggressive, so more care is advised. At the end of this level is yet another boss, this one never before encountered. A large wall of weaponry, with eyes on it and a mechanical arm that outstretches to damage your ship. There is generally a sweet spot on the screen where you can lay waste to him without fear of his laser beams and arm attack.Mission 8[CR]The final stage is the confrontation with Queen Zz Badnutsy. She's piloting a mech of course, and she has a far more advanced version of the TOZ at her disposal, which will replicate any normal weapon that the player can use. You can steal all 8 of the normally obtainable weapons from her, it seems to be random as to which you get. Whichever you decide on, you'll eventually turn her to dust and beat this difficult game.[CR]Cheats[CR]In addition to all the secret weapons with special conditions to get, there are a plethora of cheats available to the player.Hidden Options[CR]Hold A, B, or C, and press START at the title screen. This takes you to an options menu that allows you to raise the difficulty, listen to BGM/SFX, and toggle the language between English and Japanese. But more importantly, it opens up the ability to cheat.Cheat Mode[CR]To access the ability to cheat, set the BGM to #18 in the options. Using controller 2, HOLD A, and then exit the menu.

The player controls Goliath, (voiced by Keith David) leader of the Gargoyles Manhattan clan, on a journey to catch Demona and prevent her from using the Eye of Odin. There are virtually no connections to the television series's storyline. Only the aforementioned characters appear in any fashion. Most of the game takes place during the first century A.D. before the titular gargoyles are turned to stone for 1000 years to eventually be awakened in episode one of the show. As such, the player defends  Castle Wyvern against an army of vikings...and also giant, evil robots for some reason.  Like the show itself, the game targeted young teenagers and dealt with many mature story themes rarely seen in a side-scroller at the time.    The storyline is widely considered to be non-canon.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Gargoyles played similarly to most other 2-D action games of that era. The player was essentially moving from left to right on every level and there was an abundance of platforms to jump and enemies to attack. It is worth noting that Gargoyles is an incredibly tough game, even by the standards of that time and there was no continue/save system.  [CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR] Gargoyles did not fare very well in terms of sales or critical reception.

Up to four players can take control of four different characters and fight their way through a dungeon of bad guys and loot treasure. Gauntlet was the first arcade cabinet to feature four player cooperative gameplay and it caused a sensation in the Arcade when it was released in 1985.[CR][B]Classes:[/B][CR]The character classes in Gauntlet are the: Thor the Warrior, Merlin the Wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Questor the Elf whose colors are red, yellow, blue and green, respectively.[CR]Each character has its own abilities. Thor the Warrior, the slowest character, deals the most damage and is also the most effective character at close range. Merlin the Wizard is a fast character who is not good at close combat but has the most powerful magic, which is activated by using a potion found in the dungeon. Questor the Elf is the fastest character but is weak at close range. His long range shots make him a good scout (the Elf player often irritates other players since his extra speed allows him to steal all the treasure before anyone else can get a look-in!). Finally, Thyra the Valkyrie is the all-rounder who neither excels nor fails in any given department.[CR]Objectives and Gameplay[CR]The objective of Gauntlet is to progress through a massive dungeon with hundreds of levels. On each level the player(s) must reach the exit in order to advance to the next level. However the dungeon's denizens are there to make reaching that exit a tough task. Dungeons are populated by all manner of nasties including: Ghosts, Grunts, Demons, Lobbers and, of course, Death himself! Enemies in Gauntlet commonly spawn from generators and will do so inexorably until the generators are destroyed. Other features of the dungeon include locked doors, secret rooms, and teleporters.[CR]Each hero has a numerical value representing their health on the the screen. This number steadily ticks down to zero even when the hero is not taking any damage. Since vast hordes of enemies are all competing for a chunk of the heroes health, it is not an easy task to survive in Gauntlet. One remedy for this rapidly diminishing health for the arcade version is to drop more coins into the slot to buy more health points. Food pick-ups are also scattered around the dungeon which boost the health of whoever collects them. Unfortunately, food only gives the hero another 100 points of health, which doesn't last long.[CR]To make life a little easier for the heroes there are power-ups which can be collected; these include temporary invisibility, an armor boost, and extra shot speed or power. Since all characters occupy the same game screen, a good deal of cooperation is required in order for a group of players to successfully navigate the levels. A good team will fairly distribute the bonuses to the most suitable hero, i.e. \"let the Wizard have the potions\". A bad Elf player can spoil the groups chances by snatching everything![CR]One of the most memorable features of Gauntlet is the audio. The game has an announcer who, in all his 8-bit glory, declaims important messages such as \"Wizard shot the food!\" or \"Warrior needs food badly!\" At the time, it was impressive that a game had audible speech in 1985, which was novel.[CR]Gauntlet's Origins[CR]Gauntlet was originally a copy, with some upgrades, of a game by John Palevich, who contributed his dungeon crawler to Atari through the Atari Program eXchange. Palevich later sued for compensation, or at least name recognition in the credits of the Gauntlet arcade games. Atari was said to have recognized Palevich's role in the creation of Gauntlet, but as the arcade machines were already made, they maintained that adding Palevich's name would have been prohibitively expensive. Palevich was later given token compensation from Atari in recognition of his unwitting role in the creation of this game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Quest Mode Password[CR]Enter the password at the QUEST MODE Continue screen.[CR](NOTE - Be sure to enter your name as AETHER-K; or the password won't work.)",

Gauntlet was the first arcade cabinet to feature four player cooperative gameplay and it caused a sensation in the Arcade when it was released in 1985.[CR][B]Classes:[/B][CR]The character classes in Gauntlet are the: Thor the Warrior, Merlin the Wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Questor the Elf whose colors are red, yellow, blue and green, respectively.[CR]Each character has its own abilities. Thor the Warrior, the slowest character, deals the most damage and is also the most effective character at close range. Merlin the Wizard is a fast character who is not good at close combat but has the most powerful magic, which is activated by using a potion found in the dungeon. Questor the Elf is the fastest character but is weak at close range. His long range shots make him a good scout (the Elf player often irritates other players since his extra speed allows him to steal all the treasure before anyone else can get a look-in!). Finally, Thyra the Valkyrie is the all-rounder who neither excels nor fails in any given department.[CR]Objectives and Gameplay[CR]The objective of Gauntlet is to progress through a massive dungeon with hundreds of levels. On each level the player(s) must reach the exit in order to advance to the next level. However the dungeon's denizens are there to make reaching that exit a tough task. Dungeons are populated by all manner of nasties including: Ghosts, Grunts, Demons, Lobbers and, of course, Death himself! Enemies in Gauntlet commonly spawn from generators and will do so inexorably until the generators are destroyed. Other features of the dungeon include locked doors, secret rooms, and teleporters.[CR]Each hero has a numerical value representing their health on the the screen. This number steadily ticks down to zero even when the hero is not taking any damage. Since vast hordes of enemies are all competing for a chunk of the heroes health, it is not an easy task to survive in Gauntlet. One remedy for this rapidly diminishing health for the arcade version is to drop more coins into the slot to buy more health points. Food pick-ups are also scattered around the dungeon which boost the health of whoever collects them. Unfortunately, food only gives the hero another 100 points of health, which doesn't last long.[CR]To make life a little easier for the heroes there are power-ups which can be collected; these include temporary invisibility, an armor boost, and extra shot speed or power. Since all characters occupy the same game screen, a good deal of cooperation is required in order for a group of players to successfully navigate the levels. A good team will fairly distribute the bonuses to the most suitable hero, i.e. \"let the Wizard have the potions\". A bad Elf player can spoil the groups chances by snatching everything![CR]One of the most memorable features of Gauntlet is the audio. The game has an announcer who, in all his 8-bit glory, declaims important messages such as \"Wizard shot the food!\" or \"Warrior needs food badly!\" At the time, it was impressive that a game had audible speech in 1985, which was novel.[CR]Gauntlet's Origins[CR]Gauntlet was originally a copy, with some upgrades, of a game by John Palevich, who contributed his dungeon crawler to Atari through the Atari Program eXchange. Palevich later sued for compensation, or at least name recognition in the credits of the Gauntlet arcade games. Atari was said to have recognized Palevich's role in the creation of Gauntlet, but as the arcade machines were already made, they maintained that adding Palevich's name would have been prohibitively expensive. Palevich was later given token compensation from Atari in recognition of his unwitting role in the creation of this game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Quest Mode Password[CR]Enter the password at the QUEST MODE Continue screen.[CR](NOTE - Be sure to enter your name as AETHER-K; or the password won't work.)",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gemfire is a strategy game from Koei, set in a fictional fantasy medieval nation. It borrows elements from previous Koei strategy series like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga's Ambition. Players raise armies of knights and cavalry and supplements them with fantastical creatures like dragons and gargoyles in order to take control of the nation of Ishmeria.[CR]The game was released on MSX, NES, SNES, Genesis, FM Towns Marty, the NEC PC-9801 and MS-DOS PCs. The NES, SNES and Genesis versions were released in the US. In Japan the game is known as Royal Blood, or Super Royal Blood in the case of the SNES version.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Gemfire takes place on the fictional, war-torn island of Ishmeria. The Gemfire is a crown adorned with seven jewels, each one containing a powerful being. Six of the seven jewels are wizards, the seventh being a vengeful fire dragon. The wizards were sealed inside gems as they fought to save Ishmeria. Their ultimate sacrifice trapped the dragon in a ruby, but they could not escape the spell. The King of Ishmeria turned the seven gems into a crown and used its power to bring peace to the island. When he died, his son Eselred took power.[CR]Eselred used the crown to exact a tyrannical rule. His daughter, Princess Robyn -- encouraged by the whispers of Pastha the water dragon (who once fought alongside the trapped wizards) -- destroyed the Gemfire to thwart her father's oppression.[CR]Breaking the crown scattered the gems to the far corners of Ishmeria where the island's rebellious families found and used the wizards inside to aid their quest to overthrow Eselred and unite the country in peace.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When the game starts, players have their choice of four scenarios: Erin & Ander, Flax's Shame,Terian's War, and Gemfire. While Ishmeria's shape never changes, these four scenarios change which families are in play and what provinces they control at the start of the game.[CR]Gemfire's gameplay is a mixture of stat management and basic turn-based strategy. Between battle sequences, players manage their crops, troop counts, and loyalty. Waging and winning battles depends on having adequate food stores and finances.[CR]While managing stats, the player's provinces are randomly selected. The home province, where the head of the chosen family resides, controls alliances and appointing vassals to outlying territories. All controlled places can build their troops, protect their land, and hire fifth units. They cannot make or break alliances, but they can persuade vassals from other families to defect.[CR]Each character has a unique set of stats, or character facts. Their influence over battle and cultivation is determined by their Leadership, Command ability, Charm, and Fame. The higher the score, the better they perform.[CR]Leadership: ability to protect and develop a province.[CR]Command: ability on the battlefield[CR]Charm: Charming leaders are better at persuading alliances and new recruits.[CR]Fame: Fame grows with good deeds and is important for carrying out secret missions and recruiting vassals.Battle[CR]When provinces go to war, a chess-like battlefield appears. Each side controls five units. Four units are human and the fifth is either one of the Gemfire wizards or a hired monster. The human unit totals depend on the overall hired troop number. If the ruler had 100 troops before going to war, each unit would have 25 solders. It is possible to go into battle without a fifth unit.[CR]Like chess, each piece on the battlefield has a designated range of movement. Horsemen and some fifth units move three spaces. Most units only move two. Archers, riflemen, and some fifth units can attack one space away from where they stand.[CR]The dragon, much like the Queen in chess, has the greatest range of movement and attack radius. Any enemy within a three-by-three grid from the dragon can be attacked.[CR]Battles are won if one side captures their opponent's flag, eliminates all enemies in play, retreats, or runs out of food. Capturing a base sometimes awards the victor a chance to take food or money from the loser, and in some cases capture the opposing ruler. If the ruler is captured, they can be recruited, released back to their family, or banished from the game entirely.The Island[CR]Ishmeria is broken up into 30 provinces divided among 10 families, some with a greater presence than others. Since there are 10 families and only six playable wizards, not all families control a piece of the Gemfire. To make up for this, players can hire bands of monsters to stand in as their fifth unit.FamiliesFamily NameBackgroundLankshire[CR]The King's family and unplayable. The lords loyal to Eselred are some the strongest in the game, boasting high leadership and combat percentages. They control the dragon, which is the most powerful fifth unit in the game.[CR]While many of the Lankshire vassals are powerful, Eselred himself has the lowest combat percentage in the game. He compensates for this by choosing the most fortified province as his home and maintaining a high troop count.BlancheRuled by Erin. Commands Zendor, the wizard of lightning. Erin is at war with his brother Ander, the leader of the Lyle family. Sometimes controls two Gemfire wizards at the start of the game.LyleRuled by Ander. Commands Pluvius, the master of the stars. Ander is at war with Erin and is the second-most powerful leader in the game. In two scenarios, the Lyle family controls two of the Gemfire wizards.CoryllRuled by Lars. Commands Empyron, the wizard of fire. The Coryll family control the southern corner of the island and risk having their lands destroyed by an active volcano. They are perpetually at war with the Flax family.ChrysallisRuled by Garth. Commands Chylla, the wizard of ice. Controls a small island outside of Ishmeria that is connected by a bridge. This is the most difficult family to play.FlaxRuled by Erik. Commands Scylla, the wizard of wind. They are at war with the Coryll and positioned uncomfortably between the Lankshire family and the Lyle.MolbrewRuled by Leander. Commands Skulryk, the wizard of \"clouds\" as the manual puts it. Skulryk emits a poisonous cloud in the shape of a skull when he attacks. The Molbrew family is small and peaceful. On most maps, they are part of the Blanche family.TateRuled by Terian. They are in a power struggle between the Blanche and Lyle families and are the least likely to surrender, no matter how out-matched they are in battle.TordinRuled by Gweyn. A small, weak southern family that is often taken over within the first few years of war. Gweyn changes alliances from Tordin to Blanche across scenarios.TudoriaRuled by Eadric. Eadric is rumored to be the bastard son of Eselred. In the Gemfire scenario, he controls the southern lands.DivasLead by Prince Loryn. Loryn was once loyal to the Lankshire family but lost faith in Eselred. This family is trapped between the Blanch and Lankshire territories and is quickly overtaken.Temperature Zones[CR]Different area of Ishmeria experience different types of weather that can change province stats.[CR]Arctic Provinces 1-5:[CR]At the end of the year, wintry weather storms over the north.

It is surrounded by an omen of doom.[CR]The Plague (all provinces):[CR]All provinces in Ishmeria are vulnerable to the Plague. Rulers must build protection to fend it off.Elves and Ogres[CR]During the stat management phase, random events occur. These events are attributed to the elves and ogres that inhabit Ishmeria.[CR]Elves:[CR]Elvish Troubadour -- sings joyous songs of praise, raises province loyalty.[CR]Kind Redcaps -- Redcaps frolic through the fields, raising crop stats.[CR]Far Gorta -- Bring food to rulers with high loyalty that are in need.[CR]Leprechauns -- Give kind rulers gold.[CR]Fairies -- Round up soldiers for rulers with high loyalty and a low troop count.[CR]Unicorns -- Raise the leadership score of rulers they meet.[CR]Gwraigs -- Raise the charm score of rulers they meet.[CR]Airial -- calms destructive elemental forces.[CR]Ogres:[CR]Black Annis -- Terrifies the people, lowering the loyalty score.[CR]Pixies -- Ruins crops, lowering score.[CR]Aughiskies -- Horse spirits that destroy crops.[CR]Hobgolins -- Raid the land, lowering defenses and stealing gold.[CR]Shrieker -- frightens away troops.[CR]Banshee -- Wails when a ruler is going to die, or has died. Sometimes wails without reason, but when they sound there's a chance a lord or vassal on the island could die.[CR]Durahan -- Brings a message of doom. Can increase frequency of negative events in weather and character death.Unit Types[CR]First Unit: Horsemen[CR]Weapon -- Lances[CR]Range -- Adjacent[CR]Mobility -- 3 spaces[CR]Tactics -- Flanking and rear attacks[CR]Second and Fourth Units: Knights[CR]Weapons -- Swords[CR]Range -- Adjacent[CR]Mobility -- 2 squares[CR]Tactics -- Building fences[CR]Third Unit: Archers[CR]Weapon -- Bow & arrow[CR]Range -- 2 spaces[CR]Mobility -- 2 spaces[CR]Tactics -- shooting over fences and fort wallsFifth Units[CR]Each province can hire a fifth unit, whether or not they possess one of the Gemfire wizards.

Character movement and action is controlled using a cursor to point and click on new locations or enemy combatants. The exception to this is when the player selects a two person squad which can be controlled in freely in real time with the D-pad.[CR]Each character only has one fire mode, but each also handles differently. There were also Medics available to revive downed allies, however the use is limited. Additionally, units like the Launcher can kill characters outright, with no chance for revival. Other options included side objectives on a few of the maps. These usually involve either destroying or defending a rail car or helicopter, and yielding a small bonus if successful.Common battlefield skirmish[CR]General Chaos features a two player co-op mode where each player can control two of the commando classes versus five computer controlled AI players and a four player mode with the multiplayer adapter. Each skirmish takes place on a small battlefield region. Each regions connects together to make the world map - much like a game of RISK. Upon winning, the victorious side will capture the region of the world map and will be allowed to progress to the next tier of skirmishes. As new regions are unlocked the players advance towards the enemies capital city and after completing the final battle eventually sacks the capital, completing the game. After completion the game will reset the world map and the human players can choose to play through the game again on a harder difficulty.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The brief backstory, discovered mostly through the game manual, revolves around Generals Chaos and Havoc, two brothers raised in a military family. Growing up skirmishing against each other until they each became commanders of opposing forces. Generals Havoc and Chaos fought with large armies, causing vast destruction and casualties, but ended in a stalemate. They finally developed the idea of small teams of commando style units, and set out to end the conflict.[CR]Game Mechanics[CR]Close Quarters Combat[CR]Occasionally, if two combatants run next to each other, they will be enveloped in a dust cloud and have some sort of scuffle. At times, this would lead to a \"Close Quarters Combat\" encounter. Each player has at their disposal: a high, medium, low punch and kick, as well as a block. Theoretically, each has a varying strategic use (e.g. a high attack does more damage but is easier to interrupt, while a low attack does less damage but comes in faster).[CR]The computer AI at times simply forces a win by repeatedly throwing punches faster than the player can block. Also, the low punch is oddly a groin punch, which doesn't fit at all with the machismo of the game.[CR]Rampant spamming of a single attack to win a close quarters combat match can sometimes result in the attacking player being shot by the opponent with a pistol after it appeared the victim was defeated.Medics[CR]Each side had one medic per round that could be called in to revive a downed player. Once selected, the cursor turns into a cross and can be placed on a downed character, the medic then runs in from offscreen and performs CPR. The downed character is then revived with lowered health.[CR]While medics are invincible to fire, players can position themselves so as to kill a revived player as soon as they stand up.Instant Death[CR]Characters are able to take several hits before dying, however many explosive weapons would cause them to fall. Once players had reached their damage limit, they would lie on the ground for a time until they expired. Players could use a medic to revive them while downed.[CR]Some weapons, such as the Launcher, can kill players instantly, turning into skeletons and crumbling to dust. The Flamethrower is also capable of doing this. The Blaster can easily trap enemies in such a way as they can not escape between detonations, however this is not an un-revivable, instant death.[CR][B]Classes:[/B][CR]In a time where class based game play was not popular, General Chaos employed a class system to give players more choices and more opportunities for planning out an effective attack.[CR]The classes are listed below with strengths and weaknesses. Weapon range is given in the game's \"Boot Camp\" section.Gunner[CR]Armed with an assault rifle, the gunner excels at doing medium damage at a good range. Effective up to 40 meters, the Gunner is essential for dealing damage and keeping the pressure on the opponent. The downside to the Gunner is that the rifle can be prone to jamming, leaving the Gunner vulnerable for a few seconds.Launcher[CR]Using a rocket launcher, this unit is effectively the game's sniper, as his rockets can hit any target across the map as long as there are no obstacles that block the rocket. His weapon's range is at 150 meters and can permanently kill members of the opposing team . The Launcher's limitation is that he can only fire one rocket a time, thus reducing his effectiveness at close range, and can be harassed by more aggressive units like the Scorcher or Gunner.Chucker[CR]With a handful of grenades, the Chucker can lob his grenades across the terrain and deal splash damage to a group of enemy soldiers. The Chucker's throw is limited to 50 meters, but his grenade tosses can be used to siege out units that are hiding behind cover. Like the Launcher, the Chucker can be taken down by more aggressive units and cannot throw more than one grenade at a time.Scorcher[CR]Armed with a flame tank on his back, the Scorcher's flamethrower and persistence can literally melt away an entire army. Although his weapon only has an effective range of 5 meters, Scorchers can flank the enemy and light units up and, if timed correctly, barbecue an opponent with no reprisals from the enemy. Scorcher's can also permanently kill enemies like the Launcher. However, opposing units can use Gunners to keep the Scorcher away or force the Scorcher to jump into water and render his flamethrower useless as he tries to clear the tank of water.Blaster[CR]Despite having an unorthodox weapon, the Blaster can keep an enemy force suppressed with his TNT charges. While his throw is not as good as the Chucker's, he has more range than the Scorcher, as the TNT throw is effective up to 10 meters and has a greater splash damage effect than the Chucker's grenades. Like the Scorcher, the Blaster can keep units down indefinitely when the TNT is timed correctly. The Blaster's weakness is his range and can be eliminated with long range units.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]General Chaos has several gameplay quirks, including the following:The Gunner's machine gun will occasionally jam during gameplay, signified by a cartoon bubble \"Click Click.\" The character will then spend time fixing the gun, unable to fire. The game manual notes that players can give the Gunner time to unjam his gun by pausing the game, which stops the action but allows him to complete his animation.Similarly, the Chucker's grenades continue to fly when the game is paused (i.e. a player can throw a grenade, pause the game, and the targeted enemy isn't able to run away from the grenade, but the grenade completes its arc and damage the enemy). One Chucker can easy defeat the entire opposing side.When approaching the final battle, the General on the map-select screen announces \"Victory is within our grasp!\" however a spelling error causes it to read \"Victory is within our gasp!\"[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand (who gave the game a 7/10) seemed to have missed the strategy of the game when he wrote, \"...This is the ultimate one-on-one fighting game! The graphic animations and battles are absolutely hilarious -- especially the fist-fights between two individuals!\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Mode[CR]To access the game's secret mode, plug in both controllers.  Pause the game and hold down buttons A and B on controller 1, and button C on controller 2. [CR]Once this code has been registered, you can go to the next battle, war or get maximum medics as follows. [CR]To execute battle advance, hold down buttons a, c and press up on controller 1, and button b on controller 2. [CR]To execute war advance, hold down buttons a, c and press down on controller 1 and press the b button on controller 2.

Any weapons in the air (i.e. rocket, grenade, TNT) will continue to move while the men on the field remain frozen.  Any weapons that hit will damage and possibly kill their targets while the game is still paused.",

The game plays similarly to Koei's other Historical Simulation games, like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga's Ambition.[CR]The game was released on the PC-8801 and ported to various other systems. The SNES version was later rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan and the US in 2009 and again in 2015 for the Wii U eShop.[CR]Scenarios[CR]Scenario 1: The Conquest of Mongolia [Mongolia, 1184 AD][CR]Scenario 2: Genghis Khan's Grand Ambition [Greater Eurasia, 1206 AD][CR]Scenario 3: The Yuan Dynasty of China [Greater Eurasia, 1271 AD][CR]Scenario 4: World Conquest [Greater Eurasia][CR]",

The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.[CR]By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.[CR]All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts in an action-platforming game originally published in 1988 by Capcom for arcades. The game has since been ported to several home computers and consoles. It is the second entry in the notoriously-difficult Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. Three years after Sir Arthur rescues his true love Princess Prin Prin from the evil Astaroth, Lucifer (or Loki in some versions) brings forth an army of macabre minions and steals the  souls of several helpless victims; among the souls stolen is that of Arthur's beloved. Once again, Arthur dons his trusty armor to fight the demonic hordes and rescue these lost souls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur unleashes Thunder Magic[CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, but with a few notable exceptions. Arguably the most significant addition is Arthur's new ability to fire any weapon vertically up or down. Most of the original game's weapons are present and a few new weapons have been added, as well as a new set of magically-infused Golden Armor. When equipped, the Golden Armor allows Arthur to charge his current weapon to perform a powerful magic attack. Each weapon has its own unique magic, save for the Psycho Cannon.Weapons & Magic Lance - Fires a lance in a straight line. Thunder Magic fires a powerful magic bolt vertically from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right. This weapon is called \"Sword\" in some versions. Sword - A strong melee-only weapon that is swung in a short arc. Thunder Dragon Magic unleashes a flaming dragon upward that attacks sky-bound enemies. This weapon is called \"Super Sword\" in some versions. Axe - Hurls an axe in a straight line. This weapon can penetrate objects, but has a slow rate of fire. Exploding Magic summons several large explosions around Arthur's position.Torch - Lobs a torch in a short arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Fireball Magic creates four fireballs that swirl outward from Arthur's left and right sides. This weapon is called \"Fire Water\" in some versions.Discus - Fires a bladed disc in a straight line which will follow the contour of any platforms on contact. Firing while crouching causes the disc to move along the ground's surface. Mirror Magic creates a temporary protective shield ahead of Arthur's position.Dagger - Fires a dagger in a straight line. This weapon is comparatively weak, but it also has the fastest rate of fire in the game. Double Magic creates an invulnerable shadow clone of Arthur that mimics his movement and attacks for a short time.Psycho Cannon - Only available on the second playthrough. Fires a blast of powerful magic in a straight line for a short distance. This weapon cannot be charged, although its range is increased while wearing the Golden Armor.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts World[CR]The game features five Stages, each of which is split into two areas by a checkpoint.Stage One[CR]The Execution Place, a mass grave at the edge of the Demon Realm, is where Arthur begins his long quest; however, the murderous skeletons, swooping vultures and hair-trigger guillotines located here will attempt to bring his adventure to a very sudden end. This area is also a tribute to the first Stage of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins, complete with remixed music. The Stage's second half at the Floating Island on the Lake features strong winds that slow movement to a crawl. Past the island's poisonous forest, a giant demon known as Shielder protects the exit by spitting fireballs.Stage Two[CR]A constant stream of demonic turtles bounce down the slope leading to the The Village of Decay, a destroyed human settlement. After crossing a gigantic ant lion pit, Arthur is ambushed by an upgraded version of Firebrand known as the Red Arremer King. Further ahead, earthquakes and demonic flames plague the Town of Fire, a sweltering ruin terrorized by the hell-hound Cerberus.Stage Three[CR]Arthur finds himself riding a treacherous elevator up through Baron Rankle's Tower; quick movements are required to avoid being crushed against the ceiling in this auto-scrolling area. At the peak of the Horrible-Faced Mountain, Arthur boldly leaps across the outstretched tongues of several demonic statues before battling a living storm cloud called Gassuto.Stage Four[CR]Giant bones litter the floor of The Crystal Forest, a cave system leading directly into Lucifer's castle. At the halfway point, Arthur descends down the slippery slopes of The Rotting Grotto, stepping across several man-eating plants to land on the back of Ohme, a gigantic immobile worm infested with smaller creatures that collectively act as the Stage boss.Stage Five[CR]If pain was like food, then Lucifer's Castle of Evil Demons would be a feast. The entryway swarms with skeletal dragons and a gauntlet of four Red Arremer Kings as an appetizer. After climbing an ominous spiked ladder, Arthur does battle with Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins. Once Astaroth is dispatched, Arthur is assaulted by two Shielder heads attached to the walls of the next room. Twin Astaroths flank Arthur for a surprise rematch further ahead, followed by a trio of Gassutos. Past one final Shielder head and a legion of demonic insects, Beelzebub guards the Stage exit.[CR]After completing this Stage, Arthur receives a message that he cannot defeat Lucifer without the Psycho Cannon, a weapon blessed by the goddess of battle. In the series' tradition, Arthur is sent back to the first Stage, where players must complete the full game a second time. While wearing the Golden Armor, players can discover the Psycho Cannon in certain treasure chests on the second playthrough.Final Boss: Lucifer[CR]The enormous Lord of Hell sits atop his throne, firing lasers from his mouth and hands and stomping his feet in a last-ditch attempt to exterminate Arthur. However, his evil strength is no match for the power of the Psycho Cannon, which Arthur uses to destroy Lucifer once and for all before reuniting with Princess Prin Prin.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode[CR]At the title screen, while the words are flashing \"Press Start Button\", input \"A, A, A, A, Up, Down, Left, Right\" and you should hear a chime.

Global Gladiators is a side-scrolling platformer/shooter where players guide two characters through four different worlds. These worlds include Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-Town and Arctic World. During each world, the player has to blast enemies with guns called GooShooters, that look similar to Super Soakers, except they shoot slimy projectiles. Each of these worlds consist of several sub-stages. The aim of each level is to collect a certain number of McDonald's Global Arches to advance to the next sub-stage. Also, during the game, the characters are guided by McDonalds mascot \"Ronald McDonald\"s its all recycled correctly.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Players control either Mick or Mack over 12 levels in 4 worlds (Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-Town, and Arctic World). The mission is to clean up these levels of their enemies to hopefully progress to the single boss fight in the game.[CR]Development[CR]The game was originally developed for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, but was later ported to the Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear and Commodore Amiga. The game was programmed by legendary developer David Perry, who would later go on to develop such games as Alladin, Earthworm Jim and Cool Spot, all of which would use the same engine as Global Gladiators. After the release of these games, David Perry's programming team would then go on to become Shiny Entertainment.[CR]Advertisements and Messages[CR]McDonald's famous \"Golden Arch\" logo.[CR]The game features abundant references to McDonald's brand restaurants, as well as a thorough environmentalist theme, given that players are fighting monsters made of pollution, going so far as to have a bonus stage in which players must collect falling garbage and throw it into the appropriate recycling bin (paper, plastic, or glass) whilst dodging falling anvils.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 6,8,8,8 adding, \"...An excellent action game with great graphics, excellent sounds, and solid game play. The animation is liquid smooth and the game play is as fast as Sonic in some areas. The graphics are highly detailed and the sounds feature voice and other digitized effects. Plenty of levels and hidden surprises!\".[CR]In the same issue Mike Weigand gave the Game Gear edition the score of 7, writing \"...huge levels and good control. Fans of the Genesis version should take a look\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Press [C, B, A, Start] four times at the Sega logo to display the cheat menu screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]To enable cheat mode, at the Virgin logo, quickly press A, B, C, B, A, C, A, B, C, B, A, C, Start.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Golden Axe II is a side-scrolling 2D Brawler developed by   Sega released for the   Sega Genesis in 1991. Unlike   Golden Axe, with was ported to a large amount of consoles, Golden Axe II was exclusively a home console release. It did eventually find a release on other consoles a decade and a half later in 2006, appearing in the   Sega Genesis Collection for the   PlayStation 2. And in   Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection in 2009 for the   Xbox 360 and   PlayStation 3. It is also available as a stand-alone digital download on the   PC. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like the previous game in the series, Golden Axe II is a 2D brawler, in vein of   Final Fight, but with 'hack-n-slash' elements similar to   Knights of the Round. The game features a singleplayer or two-player co-operative mode. Players can choose between 3 characters:   Ax Battler: The Barbarian  Gilius Thunderhead: The Dwarf  Tyris Flare: The Amazon The player can choose between three difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and Hard. However, when playing on Easy the game can only be played up to the end of Level 5.Golden Axe II plays mostly the same as its predecessor and thus reuses some mechanics. The player can restore their life meter by eating foods scattered throughout the level and dropped by various enemies. Magic can be used once the player has collected a Magic Book, found throughout the level and by defeating Wizards. At the end of each level, Wizards will attempt to steal from the player. The player can also attack the wizards to regain their items and obtain additional ones as well.  Green Wizards will drop magic books, while Red Wizards will drop food. The player can hold up to 8 Magic Books. The more Magic Books the player has, the more powerful the spell they cast can be. By holding down the magic button, it will charge until the player lets go. The first spell only requires one, with the next powerful spell requiring four, then subsequent spells requiring an additional book.Gameplay in The Duel The Duel     A gamemode returning from the Genesis version of the previous game, the player fights through 15 increasingly challenging duels against a group of enemies. The player's life carries through subsequent stages, so risk increases the worse the player performs. After completion, or death, the player receives a rank depending on how well they performed. In two player mode, players fight alone to the death.Battle 1: LongmoanBattle 2: Longmoan, Chicken BizarrianBattle 3: LizardmanBattle 4: 2x Longmoan (Green)Battle 5: 2x Longmoan (Red Armor), Chicken BizarrianBattle 6: 2x Skeleton Battle 7: 2x Longman (Gray Armor), Chicken Bizarrian, Dragon BizarrianBattle 8: 2x Lizardman (Red) Battle 9: 2x MinotaurBattle 10:  Headless KnightBattle 11: 3x Longmoan (Gold Armor) Battle 12: 2x Lizard (Purple) Battle 13: 2x Minotaur (Purple) Battle 14: 3x Neo SkeletonBattle 15: 2x Headless Knight (Red)   [CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Levels Ravaged Village Boss: Minotaur  Ruins Boss: Headless Knight  Tower The stage has many opportunities to knock enemies off ledges for instant kills.

However, they can still be fearsome in numbers even towards the end of the game due to their dash attacks. Heninger  Skeleton Neo-SkeletonA more powerful and agile version of the Skeleton.  Wizard When defeated, they drop items. Lizard-Man  Minotaur First appearing as a boss at the beginning of the first level, by level 3 they become common enemies.       Headless Knight Another enemy that starts off as a boss on the second level, before becoming a regular enemy.   Dark Guld The final boss of the game.Bizarrian Chicken Bizarrian Dragon Bizarrian.  Bizarrians are mounts ridden by the enemy, but can be knocked off and used by the player. They can jump, tail-whip and in the case of the dragon bizarrians, breath fire. They will flee if they are left alone for several moments, or attacked too many times.  [CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Golden Axe II was composed by   Naofumi Hataya, his debut soundtrack for Sega. It did not see an official release until 2008, when it was compiled in the 3 Disc set Golden Axe: The Music.

It was developed by Interactive Designs and published by Sega. A Game Gear version of the title was released subsequently.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Greendog, a surfer dude, was surfing in the Caribbean islands when an unusually large wave wipes him out. He emerges from the water with a mysterious golden pendant wrapped around his neck, one that cannot be removed. Greendog's bikini clad surfer girlfriend Bambi observes the scene from nearby, and explains to our hero that he must now traverse six different islands in order to obtain six lost pieces of an Aztec treasure if he intended on lifting the curse. Unfortunately, the curse turns everyone he comes in contact with against him in his quest. Greendog is also unable to surf until he removes the necklace.[CR]After his grueling journey across the islands comes to a close, Greendog lifts his curse using the surfboard of the Ancients. He then surfs the night sky, while Bambi watches from ashore. She is happy yet aware that the treasure's true power has yet to be unleashed, and Greendog's story has only just begun. No followup to Greendog was ever produced.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A surfer dude that has seen better days[CR]The game plays much like other 16-bit side scrolling platformers and is remembered more fondly for it's setting and character than it's control. His main weapon is a frisbee, which is used for both long and short range attacks. Levels contain an area of location based side scrolling, followed by Aztec temples that hold dangerous terrain and puzzles. Greendog will then ride his cart copter in order to travel between islands. O some levels, such as Grenada or Jamaica, Greendog gets to travel by either skateboarding or rollerblading.[CR]Health items drop frequently in the form of fast food items and desserts. Special items such as the ability to temporarily stop time or equip Greendog with an umbrella hat are often found as well. Collecting both increases the overall score for the player, which is constantly displayed in the game's HUD along with damage, lives remaining, and up to four queued special items.[CR]Greendog's soundtrack features a dynamic mix of Calypso and Caribbean themes.[CR]The six islands in the game include:Grenada (Jungle)Mustique (Beach)Curacao (Underwater)Jamaica (City)Saba (Native Village)St. Vincent (Cave)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Pause the game and enter the code",

Don your helmet and grab the controls, for you must fight your way through four theatres of combat around the world in which the enemy are determined to make sure you fail![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Gunship 2000 utilised roughly the same format as most of the other MicroProse flight simulators of the time. That is, the player had a profile, chose their combat theatre, and either performed single missions or a campaign. The primary similarity was the randomly-generated 'primary-secondary' mission types where the player was given a primary mission (destroy a target / pickup or drop off troops or cargo / recon an objective) and a less valuable secondary objective that included the same kind of tasks as a primary. The campaign strung these missions together in a 'tug-of-war' system. Victories advanced the player's side towards victory and harder missions, defeat went the other way (though the missions sometimes got harder too).[CR]Initially the player flew a lone gunship to complete missions:[CR]    - AH-1 Cobra[CR]    - AH-64 Apache[CR]    - OH-58D Kiowa Warrior[CR]    - MD 530MG[CR]    - UH-60 Blackhawk[CR]As the player's rank increased, the RAH-66 Comanche and the AH-64B Apache Longbow were unlocked (the 'B' designation is due to the game being designed before the Longbow Apache was in service as the 'D' model).[CR]Using less powerful helicopters resulted in a higher mission score, though this had to be balanced with the likelihood of having enough fuel/weapons to complete the mission. Usually a Forward Arming Refuel Point (FARP) was present in the mission. This was important, as the player may have to refuel or rearm during the course of the mission depending on the density of enemy and distance to objectives.[CR]Planning was often an important part of the game: fuel consumption was unrealistically high (which was a good thing in this context), and the player could rarely lift off with full fuel and the best weapons loaded. Also terrain and enemy presence had to be considered (the intel briefing would often tell the player what to expect near targets). On promotion to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, the player would gain control of several other helicopter wingmen whose helicopters could also be configured to the same extent as the players. Wingmen could remain with the player or be sent off for separate tasks (such as completing the secondary objective), so a great deal of flexibility was present for tactical planning.[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunship_2000[CR]",

The game was primarily published by Atari and released in February 1989. Ports for the Genesis, Lynx, Super Nintendo and various PC systems were released in the following years.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The original arcade game features a full sit-down cabinet, complete with an early force feedback enabled steering wheel. Races include many A.I. opponents, which are spread around the track sparingly after the race start. Lap counts are typically two, consisting of many stunt obstacles such as loops and jumps, forcing the player to measure their speed at certain times to not overshoot a landing ramp, or lose momentum through a loop. If the player finishes in a top position, they are given an extra one-on-one race against the \"Phantom Photon\".[CR]Presentation[CR]The game was a substantial improvement in polygonal gaming, as most popular arcade racers of the time utilized animated 2-D sprites rather than a 3-D wire-frame environment. The player's vehicle strongly resembles a Ferrari Testarossa, which was a very popular sports car at the time of development.Traffic, A.I. opponents, and the fast-paced arcade music endemic to the late 1980's, are featured throughout Hard Drivin'.[CR]Hard Drivin' was the first arcade driving game to feature instant replay, which repeats the last several seconds of gameplay following a crash, in an elevated third-person perspective. The instant replay has its own specific musical accompaniment.[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Traffic in Practice Mode[CR]Finish a regular game, then go into the Options menu and change the race type to Practice.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] The Haunting: Starring Polterguy is an action/simulation game that was originally released for the Sega Genesis in 1993. In it players take control of  Polterguy, a smart-ass, undead teenager who has nothing better to do than scare the crap out of the people.The object of the game is to scare the Sardini family by haunting different objects (which the game refers to as \"fright 'ems\") throughout their home. To haunt something Polterguy simply jumps into the object. Once an item is haunted it will cause an effect that will terrify anyone who is in the room. For example, if you haunt a bear rug the bear head will start growling, haunt a pile of dishes and they'll go flying across the room. Each time a family member encounters one of these hauntings they will get more and more scared until they can't take it anymore and run out of the house. Once all of the family members are scared out of their home they will move to a new house where you start the whole process over again.Being a ghost, Polterguy doesn't have health, he has   ecto. Ecto is a substance that Polterguy needs if he wants to stay in the real world and his supply of it is constantly depleting. After scaring a member of the family they will drop a puddle of ecto that will help to restore your supply. The amount of ecto in your possession can also be lowered if the family dog (the only character in the game that can see you) barks at you, or if Polterguy is attacked by other, malevolent ghosts who appear in the later houses. These spirits appear to be in cahoots with the dog, who can summon them at will in the final house. If you run out of ecto you are sent to the Underworld.If sent to the Underworld Polterguy must make his way through a grueling dungeon maze to collect ecto so that he may return to the living world. These dungeons are filled with enemies such as bats and skulls which can harm or even kill Polterguy. If he makes it to the exit, Polterguy returns to the Sardini household to continue The Haunting.After scaring the Sardinis from their fourth house Polterguy must defeat a final boss, a monstrous creature which is the true form of the family dog, to finish the game.[CR]The Sardini Family:[CR]  The Sardini Family   consists of five seperate characters, each with their own distinct personalities. Vito Sardini is the Father of the family; an uptight Italian businessman with a skeptical approach to the supernatural. Though this attitude clearly changes once Polterguy gets all up in his business.Flo Sardini is the Mother and matriarch of the household; a gruff, aggressive housewife who usually appears more angry at the fact that her house is being haunted than scared. Mimi Sardini is the Daughter of the family; a spoiled and arrogant girl eager to get one back on whoever is bothering her (including Polterguy). Tony Sardini is the Son of the family. All things considered, he is the most normal of all the personalities under the Sardini umbrella. He gets scared quite easily, and is angered a lot less than the other Sardinis. Last, and certainly not least, is The Family Dog, who is perhaps the most unique of all characters in the house for a few reasons. Firstly, he's the only living creature in the game that can detect Polterguy in the house, and second, his presence is reassuring to the Sardinis.

It was designed by Osamu Tsujikawa,[2] and published in Japan by Technosoft in 1989 and in North America and Europe by Sega in early 1990.[1][3] It is the sequel to Herzog, which was released only in Japan for the MSX and PC-88 personal computers in 1988. It was the second and last game in the Herzog series. It was later released again in 1991 in limited quantities.[CR]The game tasks the player with building a military force in what became to be typical Real Time Strategy fashion in an attempt to destroy the enemy base. The game could be played against the computer or against another human player via split-screen play, which while providing each player view of their enemy tactics, still kept the action moving at a fast pace. The game is often regarded as the first real-time strategy game, and was a major influence on Dune II.[CR]Herzog Zwei combined the fully real-time, fast-paced, arcade-style action gameplay of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a fairly easy-to-grasp level of strategy gameplay.[7][8][9] It differed significantly from both turn-based strategy and real-time tactics,[8] and is the earliest example of a game with a feature set that falls under the contemporary definition of modern real-time strategy.[8][10] Along with a single-player mode against a computer opponent, it featured a split-screen two-player mode where both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken, forcing players to think quickly while on the move.[9] Though the player only controls one unit, a transforming mech, the manner of control foreshadowed the point-and-click mechanic of later games. It introduced much of the genre conventions, including unit construction and resource management, with the control and destruction of bases being an important aspect of the game, as were the economic/production aspects of those bases.[8][CR]Upon release, the game received little mainstream recognition, and its novel approach to strategy gameplay polarized critics who were uncertain about what to make of it.[7][8] It was generally well received by Japanese[11] and European critics,[12] with Computer and Video Games recognizing that its fully real-time, fast-paced gameplay set it apart from other strategy games at the time, while The Games Machine found its mixture of strategy and shoot 'em up elements to be unusual but refreshing. Reactions from North American critics, however, were generally negative,[7] with Electronic Gaming Monthly criticizing it for being too complex, judging it as a flawed shooter rather than a novel strategy game,[8] and giving it some of its lowest review scores for a Genesis game.[7][CR]Years after its release, the game eventually gained a cult following.[13] It has since been considered one of the best two-player Mega Drive/Genesis games, and has been listed among the best games of all time, by Electronic Gaming Monthly, IGN and Next Generation. It has been credited with laying the foundations for the real-time strategy (RTS) genre,[8][10][18] predating and influencing the genre-popularizing Dune II.[19][20] It is also retrospectively considered a precursor to the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre, which uses a similar formula of each player controlling a single command unit in one of two opposing sides on a battlefield.[4][5][6] Herzog Zwei has been listed as one of the most important games ever made by 1UP, while GameSpy listed it as one of the most underrated games of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Building an Army[CR]In a different approach than many modern RTS games, the player controlled a Bi-pedal walking Mech/Flying Jet hybrid that was used to build, order, transport and deploy all of the units. The player had to manage variables such as their available ammo, damage, and fuel (which depleted faster if the player was carrying a unit) all the while commanding an army of tanks, surface to air missile launchers, infantry units, as well as support vehicles and boats on certain missions. To make things even more complicated, the player's Mech could be destroyed by enemy units (SAM launchers being notoriously deadly) or by the other enemy Mech itself. If the player were to be caught carrying any cargo when it was destroyed, the cargo would be lost, and the player would be transported back to their home base. Thankfully being sent back to base was a quick process that shortened any down time to a minimum.Multiplayer Mayhem!!![CR]Each unit cost a certain amount of resources, which would automatically be replenished overtime. If the player needed more resources, they could always capture one of the many sub-basses scattered across the map. These sub-bases were important, as capturing one not only providing the previously mentioned bonus funds, also provided a new place to pick up and deploy units, as well as a place to re-fuel and re-arm the player's Mech. Of course there were risks to expanding, as it not only spread your units thin (a unit number cap of 50 units was set for both players), but the sub-bases could also be captured by the enemy, which meant defenses needed to be set to keep the enemy at bay. Of course those defenses took away from your total available units, which placed a greater emphasis on good and effective strategy and less on steamrolling the enemy with accumulating a massive military.Units[CR]The unit types within the game are as follows: Infantry, Motorbike, Supply Truck, Armored Car, Tank, S.A.M., Gatling Gun, and Boat.[CR]Infantry:[CR]Unit Cost: $500[CR]The infantry unit is pretty weak in terms of offensive power, but it also serves an important purpose. The infantry unit is the only unit that can capture expansion bases, which provide extra deployment points. Infantry units also require no supplies.[CR]Motorbike:[CR]Unit Cost: $950[CR]A very quick unit that specializes in movement over power and armor. Relatively cheap, but the downside is that the armor and weapon power is relatively weak. A good harassment tool.[CR]Supply Truck:[CR]Unit Cost: $1,500[CR]A unit with no defenses of its own, the supply truck is the games basic support unit. It automatically seeks out units with low supplies and replenishes them. An additional way to help your units in addition to doing it yourself.[CR]Armored Car:[CR]Unit Cost: $1,300[CR]The basic light attack unit of the game, the key strength of the armored car is the high amount ammunition it carries, even though it sacrifices that for overall power. At about half the cost of the tank, it makes a great unit for a quick strike.[CR]Tank:[CR]Unit Cost: $3,200[CR]The backbone of any Herzog Zwei military attacking force, an army of tanks is a scary sight for any base defenses. High armor and high weapon power, the downside comes from mobility and cost.[CR]S.A.M.:[CR]Unit Cost: $4,300[CR]Surface to Air Missile launchers (S.A.M.) are a great way to keep enemy Jets at bay. The missiles are very powerful, often killing an opponent in a few hits. A good expansion base defense. However, they have no ground attacks what-so-ever.[CR]Boat:[CR]Unit Cost: $3,400[CR]Only available on maps with water, the boat is often overlooked as a great way to attack an enemy's main base. it has a lot of supplies, and decent attack power. Plus they can only be attacked by nearby land. The boat is limited by the amount of area it can attack from.[CR]Gatling Gun:[CR]Unit Cost: $15,000[CR]The most costly unit in the entire game, the gatling gun is the best main base defense unit an army can have. Not only is the primary ground fire very effective, but it also has missiles much like the S.A.M. (though they travel slower than the S.A.M.'s missiles). The cost may be prohibitive, but the trade-off is worth it, just make sure they aren't destroyed.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameRankings71.3%[23](2 reviews)Sega Retro79%[12](19 reviews)Review scoresPublicationScoreAllGame[24]Computer and Video Games82%[9]Electronic Gaming Monthly17 / 40Famitsu29 / 40[11]InsomniaJoystick78%[27]Mega Drive Advanced Gaming85%[28]Play Time85%[29]Power Play80%[30]Raze80%[31]Sega-1610 / 10[7]Sega Power80%[32]Sega Pro80%[33]The Games Machine75%[3]AwardsPublicationAwardElectronic Gaming Monthly,[14][15] IGN,[16][17] Next Generation[13]Best Games of All Time1UPMost Important Games Ever Made[8]GameSpyMost Underrated Games of All Time[21][CR]Upon release, Herzog Zwei was not very commercially successful and received little mainstream recognition, due to its lack of marketing, relatively early release on the Mega Drive/Genesis platform,[8] and non-arcade genre on what was considered an arcade-oriented game console. Upon its 1990 release in North America, Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) harshly criticized the game for being too complex and judged it as a flawed shooter rather than a novel strategy game.[7][8] They gave it an average rating of 4.25 out of 10,[34] or 17 out of 40 overall, based on a panel of four individual reviewers giving it scores of 4, 6, 4, and 3 out of 10 (see Electronic Gaming Monthly, 1993 Video Game Buyer's Guide, page 46). The game received some of the lowest scores the magazine had ever handed out to a Genesis game;[7] 3 out of 10 was the lowest score any Genesis game had received from EGM reviewers up until 1993, and Herzog Zwei was one of only six Genesis games to have received this score up until then (see Electronic Gaming Monthly, 1993 Video Game Buyer's Guide, page 46). In Japan, the game was generally well received by Famitsu, which gave it a score of 29 out of 40. ''Famitsu'' compared it to Nectaris and Famicom Wars, but noted that Herzog Zwei distinguished itself with its simultaneous, two-player, real-time gameplay.[CR]The game was generally more well received by European critics. In the United Kingdom, Warren Lapworth reviewed the game in the March 1990 issue of The Games Machine magazine, giving the game a 75% score. He criticized the title as \"one of the silliest\" names he had seen for a video game, but described the game itself as an \"unusual product,\" a console strategy game with shoot 'em up style gameplay, stating, \"Whether it's intended to get strategists to consider buying the console or to broaden the horizons of trigger-happy lunatics, I don't know. Either way, it's quite refreshing and can be quite addictive in two-player mode, fierce rivalry developing between friends.\" In the April 1990 issue of Computer and Video Games, reviewer Paul Glancey gave the game an 82% score. He described it as \"a game of conquest between two commanders in real time\" and recognized that what \"sets it apart from other strategy games is that everything happens in real time. Both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken so you have to think on the move or die.\" He noted that the command icons are \"fairly easy to grasp\" and concluded that it is a game that helps establish the Mega Drive as a \"real\" computer rather than \"just a machine for immobilised arcade players.\" Its highest rating from a British magazine was from Mega Drive Advanced Gaming, which gave it an 85% score. In France, the game was reviewed in the November 1990 issue of the Joystick magazine, where reviewer JM Destroy gave the game a 78% score. The game was particularly well received in Germany, where critics referred to it as simply Herzog 2, with Power Play magazine giving it an 80% score in its April 1990 issue, while Play Time gave it an 85% score in its June 1991 issue.[CR]Long after its release, the game gained a cult following and achieved some popularity.[13] David Filip of Allgame gave the game a score of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as \"one of the first\" and \"one of the best\" strategy video games on home consoles and as \"a fine cure for those days when you want a different kind of RTS to control.\" Daniel Thomas of Sega-16 gave it a score of 10 out of 10 in 2004, describing it as \"very probably the finest videogame you've never played\" and as the Genesis console's \"finest hour.\" Lawrence Wright of Insomnia gave the game a score of 5 out of 5 stars in 2008. GameSpot users have given Herzog Zwei an average score of 8.8 out of 10, as of 2009[35] and 2015.[36][CR]It is often found on several \"best games of all time\" lists, owing to its precedence in the real-time strategy genre, as well to the increasing understanding of finer points of its mechanics.[8][17] It was featured in the \"Top 100 Games Ever\" list of Electronic Gaming Monthly, in the November 1997 issue which ranked it at #43[14] (by a different editorial line-up from years earlier[8]), and in the January 2002 issue which ranked it #52.[15] The February 1999 issue of Next Generation ranked it at #39 in its list of 50 best games of all time.[13] It has also been featured in IGN's \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", in the 2003 list which ranked it at #62,[16] and in the 2005 list which ranked it #95.[37] In 2003, GameSpy listed the game as one of the 25 most underrated games of all time.[21] 1UP included the game in its \"Essential 50\" list of \"The Most Important Games Ever Made\".[8][CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The U.S. game release packaging art was executed by veteran San Francisco game box illustrator Marc Ericksen, who had previously done the art for Thunder Force II, and was invited back by Sega for this image, as it was considered a 'sister' game to TFII.[37][38] A sequel was planned for Sega's 32X platform, but with the subsequent failure of that console, so, too, died the plans for a third Herzog title. With Technosoft closing its doors in 2001 and the status of the intellectual property being unknown, the future of the series is likely sealed.[CR]Scott Sharkey of 1UP states that, besides the original Herzog, earlier strategy games were \"fairly primitive and abstract by comparison,\" that earlier such games lacked the ability to construct units or manage resources which made them \"much more tactical than strategic,\" and that the slower processors and modems made the ticks \"so long that the games were practically turn based\".[8][CR]Herzog Zwei went on to influence future RTS games, particularly Dune II (1992),[39][40] the producers of which acknowledged Herzog Zwei as an influence,[19][20] as well as Warcraft (1994), Command & Conquer (1995), Starcraft (1998), War of the Ring (2003),[8] and Br\u00fctal Legend (2009).[41]Future Cop: LAPD (1998) featured a Precinct Assault mode that was similar to Herzog Zwei.[42][43]Total Annihilation (1997) and its spiritual successor Supreme Commander inherited the concept of a large robotic command vehicle which is used to construct and command an army.[CR]The roots of the popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre, also known as the action RTS genre, has been traced back to Herzog Zwei, which used a similar formula, where each player controls a single command unit in one of two opposing sides on a battlefield.[5][6]Destructoid cited Herzog Zwei as \"one of the world's first MOBAs.\"[4] In 2008, GameAxis Unwired considered DotA to then be the closest modern equivalent to Herzog Zwei, but noted that, while DotA gives the player control over a fully customizable command unit with RPG elements, it severely limits or removes the player's ability to produce and command other friendly units, whereas Herzog Zwei has a fully customizable command unit with RPG elements that the player has full control over, while commanding an army to go into battle with rather than mindless drones that respawn at set intervals.[45] More recent popular examples of MOBA games include Dota 2 and League of Legends.[CR]In 2004, a mod was created for Unreal Tournament 2004 attempting to recreate Herzog Zwei.[8] In 2008, Guilty Gear 2: Overture used strategy gameplay similar to Herzog Zwei.[46][47] On November 8, 2012, Carbon Games released AirMech, a MOBA game that is considered a more direct spiritual successor of Herzog Zwei. It features modernized graphics and added gameplay mechanics, such as online multiplayer. The game has been released under a free-to-play model, and is available from Carbon Games, Steam, and the Google Chrome Web Store.[CR]",

The goal of the game is to prevent the games villians, Harry and Marv, known collectively as The Wet Bandits, from looting the houses in the neighborhood. The player accomplishes this by causing \u201cpain\u201d to the burglars. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: booby traps and weapons. The first time Kevin enters each house he is given the chance to place traps. Kevin starts the game with a BB gun and can craft additional weapons, made from items found throughout the houses and the surrounding neighborhood. Weapons are made of three components: Platform; Operator; and Ammo.Kevin's just hanging out.[CR]There are several meters in the game. When outdoors, you are always provided with the Charge meter. As long as Kevin has \u201cCharge\u201d, he can boost the movement speed of his sled. This is especially useful when smashing through snowmen to reveal items or outrunning the bandit\u2019s van to the next house. The Charge meter can be refilled by finding batteries. Indoors, you have three meters: Ammo; Loot; and Pain. Ammo depletes as Kevin uses his equipped weapon, and will automatically refill if he finds additional ammo for the equipped weapon. The Loot meter will fill as Harry and Marv empty the safes located around the house they currently occupy. Once the meter is filled, the house becomes \u201cflooded\u201d, in reference to the Wet Bandits calling card of clogging sinks and letting the water run. Pain will fill as the bandits encounter the traps that were previously laid out or as they are hit by Kevin\u2019s weapons.[CR]If the bandits catch Kevin, they will hang him on a hook, but he can escape by wiggling in all directions. Some of the houses have a guard character that will attack any intruder, including Kevin.[CR]The game will end in a Game Over if the player in unsuccessful in stopping the Wet Bandits from \u201cflooding\u201d all of the houses. If the player is able to fend the Bandits off for the twenty minute time limit they will win the game.[CR]The game does have a higher difficulty that will unlock new items and weapons to be crafted.ItemsHome Alone features a weapon crafting system that lets you combine items you find around the neighborhood .Tire \u2013 Can be dropped indoors to help reach higher areasPepperBlow DryerBallBalloonsCoalsSnowballsRubber BandWireCanGlueMagnetCrossbowScoopTrapsTorchIceTarToysMarbles[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Freeze a Bandit[CR]In the Old House, go upstairs and stand in the bathtub.

Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.[CR]The SNES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the SNES' traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.Levels[CR]Level 1 - The Plaza Hotel[CR]Kevin's first entry to New York is the Plaza Hotel, where his father's stolen credit card helps pay the way for a nice, posh room and ideal room service. But after the hotel workers discover his ruse, he attempts to escape.[CR]Kevin leaps out of the hotel and right into the arms of his old enemies Marv and Harry, who, as well as escaping from prison and attempting to rob the Christmas toy store, have a bone to pick with Kevin and take him away. But after a quick goose on a woman, who in turn socks Marv, Kevin escapes into the confines of Central Park.[CR]Level 2 - Central Park[CR]One of New York's most popular tourist attractions, Central Park is a haven for both glamour (in the daytime) and filth (at night). Kevin enters the park at one of the worst times, having to contend with vermin and urban leeches.[CR]Level 3 - The Uncle's House[CR]Kevin knew he had an uncle who lived in New York and, after much searching, finds his house, noticing it in a state of disrepair and decay. Stones and plaster drop from the ceiling, there are holes in the floors, and several of the doors to get out are locked. Not only that, Harry and Marv have tracked him down and are both searching diligently for him and attempting to steal what remains in the house. But Kevin's set a few of his trademark traps for them to stumble across.[CR]Level 4 - The Chase[CR]After escaping from the house, Marv and Harry give chase to Kevin through the streets of New York. There are two segments to this level.[CR]Segment 1: The player must run away from Harry and Marv while avoiding the additional baddies along the way. The player must must keep running until reaching the giant Christmas tree.[CR]Segment 2: Once inside the Christmas tree, the player needs to climb to the very top and grab the flashing star in order to receive the help of the pigeon lady. The player needs to call for help for her to throw bird seeds on Marv and Harry three times each to properly defeat them and win the game. The player can bounce on the ends of the Christmas tree branches to get higher up on the screen.Reception[CR]The game has had very low critical reception. Most reviewers complain that various elements of the game change depending on what part of a level the player is on. A prominent example is made by The Angry Video Game Nerd, stating that when a key falls towards the player, the player's impulse is to collect it, Instead the key inflicts damage to the player.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select &amp; Sound Test Menu[CR]To access Level Select & Sound Test Menu, pause the game and press A, C, B, C, C, C, A, C.",

The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.[CR]Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.[CR]In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.[CR]The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.",

Aiding in this is a jet booster, which can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if overused will overheat and must cool down before being used again. There are ten different arenas, each with different hazards like oil slicks and moving barriers. There is a single player mode, where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the goal is to destroy the other player.",

There are numerous hazards that the player must watch out for, including moving platforms, solid iron blocks, blocks that will break as soon as the egg touches them, moving spikes, and tubes through which only the penguin or the egg can pass.[CR]The player can also find special items to help out; hearts will increase the bonus score, wings let the penguin jump higher, and iron eggs let the egg fall further without breaking. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, with a password given every five stages. The game also lets you pause the game to view the entire map, as well as set a waypoint to return to should the egg break.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Inventory Screen (Amiga)[CR]The game follows an apprentice who discovers a message in a puff of smoke from an enchanted candle from the Wizard Mordamir who is trapped in the dungeon far below and counting on Dunric to save him. Continuing further in the dungeon, the apprentice encounters goblins, trolls, and all manner of traps and monsters. While sleeping on straw, he dreams of an ancient city a thousand years old with water and young people everywhere. On his way through the dungeon he frees Ana, Dunric's daughter. Then the apprentice learns that the ancient city was a place where waters from the Fountain of Youth would flow from goblins who ask for his help in distracting The Norlac, a sort of water monster, in the canals below. Through another dream, he learns of an ancient peaceful civilization of dragons guarding the Fountain of Youth. Using his wits, the apprentice tricks the monster into falling into a whirlpool, but then he also is sucked in. Barely surviving the event, the wizard presses forth and has another dream. This time it's about the ancient city's council members and wizards gathering together and planning a siege, and then flashes of battles between wizards and dragons. By now he is nearing the bottom of the dungeon, and at the bottom he discovers one dragon survived the war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Magic Carpet ride (DOS)[CR]The Immortal has a lot of item-based puzzle solving, lots of deadly enemy encounters, tons of traps, and requires patience to survive. At times the game is unforgiving, wherein if you use items before they're required or in the wrong place the game will make it impossible to proceed. Sometimes the traps will be inanely difficult to proceed through, such as the infamous \"Worm Room\". Thankfully each level is short, so if you survive through it all you can record the \"certificate\" (what The Immortal calls its passwords) and continue playing another time. Combat in this game is either about entirely avoiding enemies, or going to a combat screen where the idea is to dodge until you build up your stamina and then start slashing the enemies to bits with your sword. There are several spell scrolls to pick up, and at one point even a magic spellbook that allows you to cast a minor fireball spell infinitely. The game also has certain points where you can float around to avoid the giant worms and tiny spiders such as the magic carpet and the levitation spell. This mechanic feels the same each time, as it's almost like controlling a car that can constantly accelerate, but the controls are quite horrendous and it's hard to survive these segments, as well as the one later in the game with the creature in the water canals while riding a barrel.[CR]The game has a few alternate endings with minor detail differences, based upon actions earlier in the game.DeathDueling the giant Spider Queen (DOS)[CR]In \"The Immortal\", there are so many ways to die, and many ways to kill. When fighting goblins and trolls, the apprentice can decapitate them, slice them in half at the waist, and from the head to the groin, make their heads explode, cause them to turn to ashes, and skin them alive. The apprentice himself can be consumed by slimes, body slammed and eaten by giant worms that burst through the ground, fall through trap doors, get stepped on during a shrink spell, use an amulet that causes him to die instantly, fed upon by a giant Queen Spider, and can be eaten alive by hundreds of tiny spiders.[CR]Alternate Versions[CR]Level 6[CR]The sixth level of the game only appears in certain versions of the title. It features the giant spider Queen and the tiny spider sacks that when touched will overwhelm the apprentice with dozens of spiders that eat him alive. The level also features a brief portion where the wizard can acquire some alcohol, and either drink it or use it to solve a puzzle. Drinking the alcohol would actually intoxicate the player, and make every direction the apprentice would walk in completely random.Amount of Gore[CR]The PC and Genesis/Mega Drive versions of this game had a markedly different level of gore during finishing moves in battle. Most of the gory deaths were absent from the PC version, while the Genesis/Mega Drive version had bloody eviscerations which were all kinds of awesome.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternative Ending[CR]On Level 4, don't give the Ring to Ana to get an alternative ending once you beat the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Scene (Japanese version)[CR]After the credits are done, don't touch any buttons for 3 minutes and you'll see a hidden scene from the developers.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Incredible Crash Dummies (known as \"The Incredible Crash Dummies: Slick Bouya no Daichousen\" in Japan. The subtitle roughly translates as \"Slick's Great Challenge\") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.[CR]The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. [CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.Levels (Dummy Stunts)[CR]Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The Roof Jump comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.[CR]The Air Bumper stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.[CR]The Ski Slope tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.[CR]The Dummy proceeds to enter the Bomb Factory, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.[CR]The Cruise Missle stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.[CR]After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, \"...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen, press A, C, B, A, C, B, C, C, C, A for level select.",

To design such machinery, they have hired the world's most brilliant and sinister scientists. A German spy-ring then sends agents to buy weapons from these four scientists, each located in a different part of the world.Young Indiana Jones, an agent of the Belgian Intelligence, is the only one who can stop them. He uses short-wave radio transmissions intercepted by the French to find out where the scientists are located and sets on to his mission.[CR]Missions[CR]Missions take place in many places around the world, like Tibet, Egypt, England and more.There is no fixed order in which to do the missions, you start with four of them unlocked and by completing them you unlock more missions.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Indy can use a pistol, throw grenades or swing his whip.PistolThe pistol is the best weapon in the game because of its range, but it does not damage enemies as much as the grenade. It is possible to use the d-pad to aim in all of its eight directions, except straight down. Also, it is adviseable to be economic with the pistol's shots, as ammo is scarce and it is hard to find a lot more in the levels.GrenadesGrenades are useful to break machines and stationary enemies, but not very good at taking out enemies that do move. Since most enemies move towards Indy, the grenade is not adviseable for most situations, since its explosion will not damage the enemy. The grenade's range is satisfactory, but not being able to control it makes its use quite tricky and makes it seem a bit too much work for too little of a payoff.WhipThe whip is Indy's only weapon that you can always count on during the game, since you will never run out of it. Pressing the B button makes him swing foward and hit the groung with it. Holding the B button lets you control the whip with the d-pad. When that is done, the whip's sprite looks very weird, as it changes length constantly, looking like a big, flabby rubber band. The more you keep moving the whip the more it looses its initial momentum, making it shorter and not damaging enemies as much. The whip is also used to swing while hanging to higher platforms or even to climb to those platforms. The whip is the most useful weapon against airborne enemies like bats and birds and crawling enemies like scorpions.[CR]",

The game contained both instant action matches, as well as an in-depth (for the time) career mode, where players would build up their their newly created pugilist from palooka to world champion.  Using combinations of jabs, hooks, and uppercuts, the player navigates his boxer around the ring, seeking the knockout blow.  In between matches, player-created boxers improved their skills in four categories (hand speed, hitting power, stamina, defense) by selecting various training regimens available. Knockout Boxing climaxes with the player taking on Buster Douglas for the heavyweight championship.  As a part of the career mode, player-created boxers' skills would degrade over time, making late-career bouts difficult when facing the new fighters coming up just as the player had.  The player's career concludes with his retirement after 30 matches.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]By inputting \"THEBEAST\" as the name of a player-created boxer, the player would be rewarded with a fully maxed-out fighter with green skin bearing a strong resemblance to The Incredible Hulk.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]To enable the sound test, Press Start on the first player controller and choose either a 1 or 2 player game. Then, on controller 2, press C and Start at the same time.",

It features the piscine special agent in a new mission at the North Pole. Unlike its free-form predecessor, James Pond 2 is a far more traditional side-scrolling platformer.[CR]The game was originally released on the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sega Genesis in 1991. They were followed with ports to the Amiga CD32, C64, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System and the Super Nintendo. It has recently received additional graphically enhanced ports for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Network.[CR]There have been multiple publishers for the game. The SNES port alone has three: Victor Interactive Software published the game in Japan, American Softworks in the US and Ocean Software in Europe. EA, US Gold and others have published the game on other systems.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename Robocod is a side-scrolling platformer which is very similar in feel and gameplay to the early Super Mario Bros. games. The player takes on the role of James Pond; a walking fish with body armor who must free all of the Penguins and Toys that the evil Dr. Maybe has captured. In addition to the more traditional elements of platforming, the player has the ability to extend James' body vertically in order to reach platforms and items. He also has access to a number of vehicles throughout the game, such as cars, biplanes and a flying bath.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The UK version of the game contains one of the earliest known forms of in-game product placements with the Penguins in the game advertising the \"Penguin\" chocolate bar by McVities.The SNES version of the game was called Super James Pond in North America, whereas in other regions it was called Super James Pond 2.The Playstation, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game are re-makes rather than ports, with changes to music, level design and art, they are generally considered to be inferior games.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand revealed little in his short review of the SNES version of the game other than his review score of 5 out of ten. He wrote, \"...James's ability to make himself tall is quite interesting, but that is really the only special thing about him\". He suggested that fans of the franchise may prefer Aquatic Games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the title screen, hold A+C+Down+Left. Release the buttons after the screen goes black.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]At the hub level (the building), run right and stretch up onto a roof.

The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.[CR]Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]At the title screen menu, press A, B, C three times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Max Experience Password[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Mahjong Titles from each Row (Row #, Title #):",

This was mostly due to the fact that the game made full use of 16-bit home computers graphics and processing abilities and, for its time, had very realistic ball physics.[CR]Even today this game is considered by many to be THE snooker game which all others are compared to.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is standard snooker rules for one or two players. There is also a trick shot mode included with pre-set up tables with instructions on how to complete each shot.[CR]There are 4 computer players to play against. Tom, Dick, Harry and Jimmy. Jimmy being the hardest of the 4 computer opponents, named after the games namesake professional snooker player Jimmy White. Beating Jimmy was the ultimate test of your skill as the computer AI for Jimmy had a habit of clearing the table with a maximum break of 147 points, if given the chance.Balls make faces at you if you take too long over a shot.[CR]Thanks to a well laid out user interface, playing snooker in Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker is surprisingly easy to get to grips with but difficult to master, much like real snooker. Using the menu to the left of the screen you can set your spin / English on the cue ball as well as your power, raise and lower the butt of the cue etc. You also have the option to apply chalk to the tip of the cue, something you have to do after every shot, specially when applying side / English to the cue ball, to avoid having a miss cue and messing up the shot.[CR]Humor[CR]Even though the game is thought of and designed as a serious snooker simulator there is a humorous side to it. If you left the mouse alone for a while flies would begin to buzz around the screen and if you took too long playing a shot the balls on the table will pull funny faces at you occasionally holding up signs saying things like \"Get on with it\".[CR]",

Sega did not have the rights from the NFL though, so there were no actual NFL teams in the games. Instead, teams were generic teams named after cities, and Joe Montana is the only actual NFL player in the game. [CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]Sega Bowl: Play 4 teams consecutively, each team tougher than the last, win all four and you win the championship. [CR]Normal: An exhibition game, you can choose between 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 minute long games. [CR]2 Minute Drill: Your team starts the game losing and on your own 20-yard line, and there are only two minutes left in the game. You must come back from behind to win. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Offense: On offense you controlled the quarterback, and there is a helmet cam to show where the receiver is when it is a pass play. You can switch between receivers. When you have the ball you can dive or lower your head to try to break tackles. [CR]Defense: On defense you had the ability to deliver a \"bone-crushing\" tackle that had the ability to injure the player with the ball or make them fumble. [CR]Penalties: Some penalties were called in this game: Offsides (being on the wrong side of the ball before the snap), Pass Interference (hitting a receiver before the ball gets to him), Delay of Game (failing to start an offensive play before the play clock expires). Penalties can be turned off, this means that they won't be called (Offsides will stop the play, but yards won't be lost) Playbook: Each team has the same 24 offensive plays (11 passing, 9 rushing, 4 special teams) and the same 24 defensive plays.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]Teams were divided into four categories: Top-Notch, Strong, Good, and fair. There were 4 team in each category. Better teams were faster and could throw and kick farther. There is no difficulty setting in this game, so playing as a weaker team is the only way to increase the challenge. [CR]Each team had an analysis and hints on beating them   before the game, this was known as Joe's Game Plan. Top Notch Teams [CR]San Francisco (NFL counterpart- San Francisco 49ers): \"So you want to take on my teammates and me. Well, you will have to throw the ball deep to beat us...and shut me down in the 4th quarter.\" [CR]New York (NFL counterpart- New York Giants): \"The defense is the core of this team. Their linebackers are relentless, but you can win with short passes. The QB is a consistent winner, and their halfback is a real workhorse.\" [CR]Los Angeles (NFL counterpart- Los Angeles Raiders):   \"Offensively, this team possesses the most explosive backfield in the league. The defense tends to over-commit, so establish your running game. But hold onto the ball-- you're going to get hit hard.\" [CR]Buffalo (NFL counterpart- Buffalo Bills): \"You'll be able to pass deep on the cornerbacks, but watch out for their all-pro linebackers on the short ones. The QB has a cannon arm, and the receivers are always a threat for the long bomb.\" Strong Teams [CR]Miami (NFL counterpart- Miami Dolphins): \"This team's all around solid defense is stingy on the points, but they can be beat with passes underneath the secondary. The QB has a quick release, and his receivers can burn, so you'll need to play good pass defense.\" [CR]Chicago (NFL counterpart- Chicago Bears): \"Set them up with the running game, then go deep over the middle, but be prepared to take some big hits. Their powerful offensive line will create big holes for their speedy halfback, so play tight defense.\" [CR]Washington (NFL counterpart- Washington Redskins): \"You can take advantage of their swarming defense by calling misdirection and play action plays. Their trio of receivers is the best in the league, so get to the QB early.\" [CR]Kansas City (NFL counterpart- Kansas City Chiefs): \"Keep the ball away from their all-pro defensive secondary by establishing your running game. Get ready to face a consistent QB, supported by a powerful runner. Great kicking game.\" Good Teams [CR]Houston (NFL counterpart- Houston Oilers): \"Watch out for the right side pass rush, and the quick secondary. The QB heads a high powered offensive attack. Take advantage of weak linebackers with flare passes.\" [CR]Philadelphia (NFL counterpart- Philadelphia Eagles): \"These guys are slow up front on defense, so run around the ends, and pass to the corners. The QB is a real scrambler so make sure not to over-commit on the pass rush.\" [CR]Cincinnati (NFL counterpart- Cincinnati Bengals): \"This team can be beat with crisp short passes and runs up the middle. On offense, the QB is a real fighter. He gets good protection, and his running backs are quick and powerful.\" [CR]Atlanta (NFL counterpart- Atlanta Falcons): \"They have a big pass rush, so you won't have much time to throw the ball. Watch out for their cornerbacks who have pure speed. You won't them deep, so throw the short stuff.\" Fair Teams [CR]Detroit (NFL counterpart- Detroit Lions): \"They've got a running back who can fly, but their passing attack is weak. To beat this team, run around the ends, and pick apart their secondary with short passes.\" [CR]Cleveland (NFL counterpart- Cleveland Browns): \"Tough up the middle, so get the ball into the secondary for big plays. The QB is smart and is a good leader, and the receivers have good hands.\" [CR]Denver (NFL counterpart- Denver Broncos): \"Run right up the middle on these guys. The defense is weak and will give up a lot of points, but watch out for the hard-hitting secondary. Offensively, the QB can sting you with the long bomb.\" [CR]Tampa Bay (NFL counterpart- Tampa Bay Buccaneers): \"Attack the right side of the defense with long passes. Stay away from the left side linebacker. Their veteran QB throws accurate passes to talented receivers.[CR]",

The game was the first in the long-running Madden NFL franchise. The game featured John Madden on the cover however the franchise started featuring NFL athletes on the cover in 2000 on the cover of Madden NFL 2001.[CR]John Madden Football is also the only Madden game to release on the Commodore 64 and Apple II. [CR][B]Features:[/B][CR]No Real Teams [CR]Although the Madden games are now known for their up-to-date rosters of real NFL teams and players, John Madden Football does not include actual NFL teams or players because no NFL or NFLPA licenses existed for the franchise at the time. There are, however, teams that are based off of actual NFL teams.No Season Play[CR]Real teams aren't the only difference between this version of Madden and latter day versions; there is also no season play in John Madden Football. The only mode of play is single games. Create-A-Team[CR]The game has a \"blank\" team that the player can create from scratch and either play as them or let the computer take over. It's possible to change player numbers, names, positions, and ratings.Field Conditions[CR]The game has four different field conditions options: hot, rain, snow, or cold and windy. Quarter Length[CR]There are four different quarter length options: 8, 10, 12, or 15 minute quarters. Playbook Creator[CR]Although the game comes with two playbooks, one for offense and one for defense, there is a play creator for anybody to create their own.Save System[CR]Players can save their games at any time using a separate disk.Other Options[CR]The game featured other options that disabled fatigue, penalties, injuries, cross-hair passing, or the 30 second clock. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Teams[CR]At the first Option Screen, press B, A, C, A, C. If done correctly, you will hear Madden say something and if you move your team selection before ALL MADDEN, you will see the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Teams[CR]At the Options Screen, press A, C, C, B, B. If done correctly, you will hear Madden say, ''BOOM!''. The coin toss is sped up heavily.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following password:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Make any opponent miss an extra point[CR]To make any opponent miss an extra point, purpously go offsides repeditly until the ball is placed on the goal line.  When the extra point is kicked from there, the kick will not be able to go high enough to get across the cross bar and the kick will always be missed.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rampage Edition's animated title screen.[CR]After the success of the original Jurassic Park for the Sega Genesis, a sequel was pitched to take advantage of the remaining interest in the franchise. The game was soon approved for development with most of the original team intact, though with a significantly shorter schedule of about six to eight months. A programmer from the first game, Jason Weesner, wrote the original design document for the game.[CR]For Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition, a completely new game engine was built to handle the new environments. Though much of the art from the original Jurassic Park was recycled for use. Though many sprites were noticeably touched up, with most characters receiving a defined black outline. Similarly the original game, you could still opt to trade in your guns for claws and play as the velociraptor.[CR]Differences[CR]Rampage Edition differed from its predecessor in several ways. In the first Jurassic Park the developers were given specific instructions to not allow the player to kill dinosaurs for fear that it would frighten children playing the game. However for Rampage Edition the player's arsenal was extended to include armament such as flamethrowers, machine guns, and a plasma weapon that reduced enemies to skeletons before turning them to dust. Because of this more apparent violence the game was given the now-defunct rating of MA-13.[CR]In the original game the player progressed through levels in a strictly linear fashion. For the sequel the level progression became much more non-linear, allowing you to select one of three stages when you begin. Completing these stages in any order opened access to more.[CR]Level Design[CR]The game gave you six levels to play if you select to play as Grant and a total of five levels if you play as the velociraptor. Depending on which character you chose meant each level would play out different and in a slightly different order.The AviaryGrant works his way back to the ground.[CR]Selecting Grant starts you in the grip of a flying pteranodon which drops you in its nest, but not before exposing you to attacks from soldiers and other dinosaurs. Your goal is then to work your way from the tree tops back down to the bottom of the stage. As you make your way down you must avoid fire from enemy soldiers as well as dinosaur attacks. In addition to this, occasionally a pteranodon latch on to you, taking you back to the top of the level. On the other side, when playing as the velociraptor you must work your way from the bottom of the stage up to the top, and then down once more.The Savanna[CR]Immediately upon starting this stage as Grant you are met with a stationary gallimimus. Jumping near it causes GrantCruisin' down the street on a gallimimus back.[CR]to get on its back and shout \"Yeehaw!\" From here you ride through the stage's barren landscape while avoiding occasional explosive attacks from a helicopter. Playing as the raptor has you running straight from one end of the stage to the other while avoiding attacks from the same chopper, as well as other dinosaurs and soldiers.Cargo Ship[CR]Playing as Grant has you starting in the back of the ship, working your way up to the main deck. Upon making your way the the front of the ship the floor collapses and you find yourself inside the ship. Grant continues to make his way deeper in the ship before it begins to take on water. As the ship sinks you must keep above the rising water level and escape. Playing as the velociraptor has this stage as the finale where you confront your nemesis, the red raptor.[CR]The cargo ship stage was apparently inspired by a Japanese Super Famicom game called Septentrion, which took place on a sinking Titanic-like luxury liner.The Hidden Ruins[CR]This stage takes place in a series of overgrown ruins that strongly resembles those of the aztec. The stage unfolds similarly for both players,Riding on a triceratops.[CR]progressing as you move deeper down in the ruins. One area where the two players differ in this zone is a segment where Grant rides a triceratops, breaking through a series of weak walls.Raptor Rapids[CR]Playing as Grant has you beginning the stage in a motorboat, similar to a segment in the original game. Grant works his way through the river in the boat, dodging attacks from soldiers and dinosaurs. Notably as you continue playing the stage the lighting will progress from day to night. Playing as the velociraptor has you running through the stage on the ground, with the river in the background.Burning RiverGrant attempts to dodge the Tyrannosaurus.[CR]This stage, which is exclusive to Grant's campaign, sees you still piloting the motorboat from the previous level while a T-Rex chases you down through the river.

In the game there are four competitions (World Cup Finals, League, Knock Out Cup and the challenge). There is several options for game speed and ball control to suit both novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has \"key players\", such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.[CR]Reviewer: Kabushi[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/kick-off-3[CR]",

The game contains 103 levels, varying wildly in difficulty and size, although the player is free to choose his own path through the game. The game was re-released as a part of Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (360/PS3).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story is a throwaway plot, like most platformers at the time. A new game at the arcade can simulate reality; everything is all fine and dandy until one of the bosses, Heady Metal, begins somehow imprisoning those who lose within the game. Players control a sunglasses-wearing kid, who has been called upon to venture into the game and defeat him.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a platformer that includes the concept of masks - powerups which enable all sorts of powers. One of these forms is a knight who can climb and break blocks beneath him by jumping, another is a hoverboarder who can change the direction of gravity. The levels are organized in such a way that these are required to pass through the game, often incorporating two separate paths based on which mask the player is wearing. The game includes four bosses - each manifestations of Heady Metal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives Glitch[CR]Lose all your lives and in the last life, die and immediately press and hold start.

Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch the blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Failure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends.

                "plot": "Landstalker is an action packed adventure, where you play Nigel, the Elf. You must search for the treasures of King Nole, and face many uncharted areas in your search for riches. Grab your sword and your booty bag, it's off to the island of Mercator to find the treasure. [CR]The legends of King Nole are known through out the land. Hundreds of years ago, the evil King swept across the continent, amassing hoardes of riches. Many treasure hunters have tried to find the large cache of jewels and other riches, but none have found anything. Returning to the city of Kalva with his latest find, Nigel is exuberant that it sold as well as it did. Planning to live on the coast for a while, he was taken by surprise when a tiny girl with wings and a forked tail sails into his backpack. She says she knows where the treasures are hidden, and is anxious to take you there.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]The player, as Nigel the treasure hunter, is tasked with searching for clues that lead to the treasure of King Nole. This is accomplished primarily by travelling through both outdoor areas and dungeons. All gameplay takes place in an isometric view, including plot-advancing scenes.[CR]From the outset of the game, Nigel may walk, jump, swing his sword, talk to various non-player characters, and pick up and throw various objects. With very few exceptions, these basic actions do not change throughout the game, although Nigel's weapons and armor may be replaced with better versions thereof. There are a variety of items throughout the game, most of which are either restorative in nature or important to advancing the plot or solving puzzles.[CR]The game's dungeons are filled with monsters, puzzles, and traps that require the player to jump from platform to platform. Locked doors inhibit the player's progress, and keys must be found to unlock them. The player has health which is kept track of by hearts; health and the maximum health limit may be increased with items purchased in towns or found in dungeons. The player is not prevented from revisiting old towns and dungeons, and is frequently required to do so to advance the plot.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]- There was a scene cut out where Kayla is taking a bath. Nigel can either join or trying leave her, but in the end he will be beaten by Friday or Kaylas Henchmen.[CR]- \"Madam Yards Studio\" (brothel) was renamed to \"Ballet Studio\" for NA and European territories.[CR]- The Ending differs slightly from the American and European/Japanese ones. The original ending is that one where all the treasures are gone.[CR]- In 2005, it was announced that Landstalker will be remade for the PlayStation Portable, but the release date was canceled. This game was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on September 3, 2007, and in Europe on October 5, 2007.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]D-Pad: Move character[CR]D-Pad Up: Climb[CR]Start Button: Bring up inventory screen[CR]A Button: Action[CR]B Button: Jump[CR]C Button: Action[CR]Reviewer: Alex Vo, Guy Chapman[CR]http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11759&tab=controls[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/landstalker-treasure-of-king-nole[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Stalker[CR]",

The player controls Jack Slater, an LA police detective that must beat up hordes of thugs in order to progress through each of six stages. Most of the gameplay consists of repetitive fights against a few different types of enemies, using a very limited number of attacks. The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.[CR]The game was released on multiple home systems. There are three discrete versions from different developers:The Bits Studios release, which is a brawler that lacks a depth of field (similar to early games in the genre, like Vigilante) and features a couple of action stages where Slater must chase down enemies via his convertible. It was released on the SNES and Genesis, and both versions are largely identical save for a few graphical and gameplay tweaks. There's also a much more compact variant for the Game Boy and Game Gear.The Teeny Weeny Games release for the NES. This is a much more standard brawler, like Double Dragon. The stages have entirely different layouts, and even includes a stage based on a dream sequence in the movie where the main character re-imagines Hamlet as an explosive blockbuster.The Psygnosis release for MS-DOS and the Amiga. This is, again, a brawler with driving sequences, though the game looks and plays completely differently to the Bits Studios release. This version originally appeared on DOS several months after the home console versions, and was ported to the Amiga by The Dome Software.[CR]Last Action Hero received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls. In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as \"one of the worst SNES games ever made.\" A rundown of all the different versions of this game can be found on Hardcore Gaming 101.[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level skip and immortality[CR]To enable level skipping and immortality, at the start of the first level walk across until you are in front the police car. Now hold B + C + Up for 30 seconds, use the timer at the top. Don't worry if you start jumping. Now pause the game and press Up for immortality, or Down to skip the level.",

                "plot": "The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in \"Project 5\", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. [CR]With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.[CR]While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. [CR]The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Pause the game.

When all 12 pieces of talisman are united, the island of the lemmings will be saved.[CR]Over 50 types of lemming are featured in Tribes, compared to just 8 of the original game.[CR]Each Tribe starts with 60 lemmings. In a significant departure from other Lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived could proceed to the next level, which might lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring earlier levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze are awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] additions not related to the lemmings themselves include hazards and challenges specific to each environment, and the interface features an additional 'fan' icon, which allows drifting lemmings to be blown along.[CR]Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Tribes of Lemmings 2:Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)SpaceThe Lemmings of the Twelve TribesArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker[CR]*returning from the original Lemmings.

You'll need all the firepower you can muster in 5 heated stages: the Bank Robbery, Stagecoach Holdup, Saloon Showdown, Train Robbery and The Hideout. Between rounds you'll be treated to the Bous Stages where you can shoot bottles or face-off with some bad hombres in an old-fashioned showdown. Throw out the accuracy scores - the goal here is to survive! If you hit an opponent with a grazing shot, you'll have to shoot again quick to put 'em out of commission before they retaliate.

                "plot": "[CR]The PC version is very straightforward, all missions are available at start and there's nothing to unlock, in the Genesis version there is a linear progression where you unlock the next mission using passwords. Missions vary from search-and-destroy enemy targets, escorting other helicopters, transporting troops, making supply drops or picking up wounded soldiers, P.O.W.'s or other operatives from the battlefield. Each mission begins at a friendly airfield and are intended to be ended either at the same or a designated other. Success means a simple text briefing, a medal if warranted, and the opportunity to move to the next mission. Medals persist through play sessions.[CR]Four Helicopters are available to the player:UH-60 Blackhawk - The game's Blackhawk could fire TOW missiles, unguided Rockets, or 2 fixed machine guns. The TOWs lacked power, are hard to use in flight, and cannot catch the faster enemy jets, but when in the right circumstances could down a target without exposing the helicopter to return fire. Rugged, slow, but agile and able to fly low.AH-64 Apache - The Apache could fire Hellfire Missiles, unguided rockets, Sidewinder missiles, or a turret-mounted 30mm cannon. The Hellfires and cannon can shot anything in the player's view once lock-on is achieved, allowing the player to engage targets on the move. Very durable and agile, but slow and less effective in the air-to-air role than the LHX.V-22 Osprey - The Osprey, making possibly its first appearance in a video game, was a huge and fast transport. Armed with a turret-mounted gun, TOW missiles, additional (fixed) guns, or unguided rockets the Osprey was amazingly well armed and fairly durable.LHX - The titular aircraft of the game, the Light Helicopter Experimental was based on the never-built Bell-McDonell Douglas prototype from the 1980s. Incredibly fast for a helicopter and supremely agile, the LHX features a turret-mounted 20mm Cannon and a large Stinger and TOW or Hellfire armament.[CR]Helicopter selection is left up to the player, with the only restriction being for missions which required picking up or dropping off something, in which case only the Osprey and Blackhawk transports are available. Each helicopter has a unique cockpit, slightly different weapons load-out, and handles in their own way. But they all share similar systems, either displayed on an instrument panel or available as various options for Multi-Function Displays:Radar - A black field with dots representing ground and airborne threats as well as incoming missiles and objectivesWeapon Status - A display of current weapon stores remainingRD/IR warning - A series of lights indicating whether you are being tracked enemy Radar or Infrared sensors and how strongly. Will flash a warning about incoming missiles.Nav Display - Shows your way-points and your distance to themMechanicals - Displays your throttle setting fuel remaining,and indicates damage to oil or hydraulic systems.Gun Camera - Shows a zoomed view of whatever you are locked ontoHUD - The Heads Up Display above the instrument panel shows your virtual compass, target reticule, and flight information.[CR]Flight is straightforward for the most part, throttle up makes you ascend, down makes you descend, a certain setting allows you to maintain altitude. To move forward, the player simply tilts the helicopter forward and it accelerates, the tilt stops at a predetermined point. Turning is achieved by rotating the helicopter, strafing is also possible. To fly more radically, a \"stunt\" key can be pressed which removes the stop point and allows more dramatic maneuvering, but the game isn't made to be flown this way for extended periods and attempting to due so invariably makes the aircraft un-flyable. The Osprey has an airplane mode, pressing a button rotates the engine nacelles forward and the aircraft flies like an airplane. Landing this way is possible with enough practice, but takeoffs must be done in helicopter mode.[CR]Engaging the enemy is as simple as getting a lock and firing for some weapons such as the turreted guns. The unguided guns and rockets require you to aim the whole aircraft and fire. The Hellfire will loose lock and miss if you don't keep the target locked the whole time. The TOW is a bit unique, as the player's control will switch from their aircraft to the missile for its flight. Your camera view jumps to the missile, and you Kamikaze it into your target. The downside is that you cannot control your aircraft during this time; if its not hovering, landed, or locked into a heading it may crash.[CR]To avoid missiles, you can also fire off flares to defeat IR missiles, and Chaff to defeat radar missiles and radar-guided guns. You have a limited supply of both and neither is guaranteed to defeat incoming. The player must fly evasively, low to the ground and around terrain, to mask their movement as well as use the aircraft's weapons to take out threats.[CR]Damage from enemy fire is represented by the screen shaking and a few polygons exploding from the impact. There's no damage \"meter,\" has the aircraft is hit more it will lose systems to an unusable \"damaged\" state or begins loosing critical fluids to leaks. The pilot can be wounded, represented by holes in the windscreen. After enough damage the aircraft will explode into a fireball which crashes uncontrollably, but before that it may loose enough critical systems to loose control and crash, or the pilot may be killed (resulting in a crash). If the player makes an emergency landing and survives, but is unable to continue to the objective, they can choose to end the mission. Depending on where you land, this can have different results. Landing in your own territory will often earn you a complete, but if you've been wounded you may die of your injuries. Landing in enemy territory could result in any of a number of scenarios: captured by the enemy (and later traded on a POW exchange or escaping, simply walking out) picked up by friendlies, or being found and killed.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN PASSWORD (APACHE)[CR]Enter the password CALVARY for unlimited ammo and to start at that mission.",

Liberty or Death is part of Koei's Historical Simulation Series.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]The player can choose to control any of six Commanders-in-Chief, three each on the American Continental Army or British Army sides, during the American Revolutionary War.[CR]For either side, the general objective is to eliminate all enemy troops throughout the Colonies by defeating them in battle. The strategies used to accomplish this change are based on which side you have chosen to play: the American side needs to hold out against the British and slowly gather its strength, while the British need to fortify their existing positions and quickly move against the Americans.[CR]The gameplay focuses mainly on the military aspects of the conflict, but relationships with civilian, and particularly political, entities are of vital importance as their approval determines the budget for military spending, and in the worst-case scenario, they can vote for your ouster as C-in-C. Very historically accurate, the game faithfully reproduces the strategic situation of the war as well as many historical figures in great detail.[CR]This game is known among players for its thoroughly researched historical detail, great complexity, level of difficulty, and the immense amount of time it takes to complete one game (similar to the experience of other Koei games). One could easily spend upwards of 250 hours on one game and might still be defeated in the end. The user interface showed many improvements over previous Koei games, including mouse support. The game can be played in one-player mode, two-player mode, or with two computer-generated players.[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_or_Death[CR]",

While the Game Gear release is a scaled-down port of the MSX version with minor changes, the PC-Engine CD version adds even more voice acting; likewise, the Mega Drive version adds several floors to the game's tower and maps each spell to a D-Pad input.[CR]",

Devil Hunter Yoko is about Yoko Mano, who was a regular girl making her way through high school--until she learned that she is the 108th successor to a line of warriors charged with defending the earth against demons. [CR]Every woman born into the Mano family has taken up the role of the legendary Devil Hunters, warriors who battle demons and other forces of darkness who threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional alignment with our own, which could cause a portal to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She must stop the demons before they can perform the ritual that will mean the end of the human race.[CR]Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side scrolling action/platformer game along the lines of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also if you hold the attack button you can create a shield which will block weak attacks. The shield can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You play through various different worlds, such as a plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a snow stage, etc.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released as a trackball arcade game from Atari Games, Marble Madness was created, designed and programmed by developer Mark Cerny. The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness is well known for it's soundtrack and was the first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. This was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allowed arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first \"killer apps\" for the Amiga and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You think you can get the marble through this course? Madness!Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (helpfully marked \"GOAL\"). The player's marble carried momentum and a rudimentary physics model provided most of the challenge, as it was easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism.The marble can be destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning the player's marble near by. While there was no \"lives remaining\" counter, each fall or death wasted valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that made it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player lost more than one or two marbles.As the game goes on, enemies and obstacles are introduced to the player to make course completion more difficult. The player will run into challenges like moving platforms, catapults, a black \"enemy\" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill.Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR]",

Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends No, Bip and Sarah tries to return to Palombia.[CR]While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it  includes a twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the Earthworm Jim levels where Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other enemies away, but also to change Bonelli's direction. The player also collects fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the player can't make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally available.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Passwords[CR]Enter one of the following passwords for the desired affect:",

This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.[CR]A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not, you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.[CR]You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones, which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food. The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them. [CR]During the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the \"clone\" attack. Hidden throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and enemies.[CR]The last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from \"rock, paper, scissors\" through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win one of the mini-games, you are able to free one of the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball that you need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the Bonus Stage where you must collect shooting stars for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are transported back to the start of the last section.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Japanese version Level Passwords (Hard Mode)[CR]You first need to set the difficulty mode in the options before entering a difficulty specific password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Japanese version Level Passwords (Hard Mode)[CR]You first need to set the difficulty mode in the options before entering a difficulty specific password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Japanese version Level Passwords (Hard Mode)[CR]You first need to set the difficulty mode in the options before entering a difficulty specific password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Japanese version Level Passwords (Hard Mode)[CR]You first need to set the difficulty mode in the options before entering a difficulty specific password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Japanese version Level Passwords (Hard Mode)[CR]You first need to set the difficulty mode in the options before entering a difficulty specific password.",

You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Do the following at the title screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Enter the sound test code and then on the sound test menu, do the following:",

The survivors have fled underground and are constantly attacked by the Bio-Beast horde until one day a scientist by the name of Dr. Kabuto creates a mech, the Mazinger-Z, that can be used against the monsters.  This is where the player takes control of the games protagonist and pilots the suit in an attempt to reclaim the Earth.[CR]The gameplay is a hack-n-slash game, where the player controls the suit by using the D-pad and using the face buttons to slash at enemy monsters.  There is also a Super Attack that the player can use, but it will decrease their health after each use.  The enemies consist of mutant animals such as dogs and beetles as well as the Bio-Beast soldiers that can range from regular soldiers, female fighters and even ninjas.[CR]There are five levels in all (Tokyo, Asia, Europe, New York and Egypt) divided into three stages with a mini-boss and a main boss the player must defeat to advance to the next level.  There are also items scattered throughout the levels that will give the player extra points, health refills, an extra life and even a brief stint of invincibility.",

[CR]Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.[CR]Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.[CR]Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.[CR]If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.[CR]The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. [CR]You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Epoch Passcodes[CR]Select OPTIONS and select LOAD to get to the password entry screen.

This was probably added to prevent any slowdown from happening during the fight.Ice Man lags, but this is possibly from the aforementioned sprites issues.[CR]Some layouts were changed, but in slight ways:There are lesser amounts of Suzies in Cut Man's stage.The strangely-placed continue spot in Elec Man's stage on the edge of a platform at the start was removed.The extra life in Guts Man's stage was moved to a lower area and the pitfall below was closer, making it easier to cross over to the life.The fake pitfall in Fire Man's stage is now a real one, and if Mega Man jumps in it, he falls to the next part.Wily stage 1 has flying machines which go over the edges.[CR]Two weapons were changed:Super Arm has a much higher arc when throwing Guts Blocks across the screen.Magnet Beam will extend out in just parts, making it much slower.[CR]Glitches were fixed, with exception to the glitch in which Mega Man loses a life on spikes when hit by an enemy attack:The Select button glitch in which one enemy could be hit over and over by hitting the Select button rapidly was taken out. This was effortlessly removed as the Genesis has no Select button, nor a pause screen except for weapon choice.Items do not re-spawn when leaving the screens.Mega Man 2[CR]Like Mega Man, Mega Man 2 is also a decent port, but it also had changes done.[CR]In all versions of the game, there is no difficulty selection. This was originally only in the Japanese game, but the European and American versions do not get the option for \"Easy\" difficulty now[CR]Layouts were changed, but in slight forms:The clouds in Air Man's stage which have the enemies on it are spread out.The middle of Flash Man's boss battle is not as deep as before.There is a wall in Wily stage 1 which stops the slider enemy from flying off screen, rendering him a threat.The gap in which Mega Man had to use the Item-1 over and over was widened out.[CR]Robot Master attributes were altered slightly:Air Man goes closer to the wall, meaning Mega Man cannot shoot behind.Flash Man has a much higher defence to Mega Buster.[CR]Some weapons were changed slightly:Item-3 moves a lot slower, but not from slowdowns.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Wily Tower[CR]To unlock Wily Tower, beat Megaman, Megaman 2, and Megaman 3 on the same save file.

                "plot": "Mega Turrican is a 16-bit shooter game, developed by Factor 5, and marketed in 1995 by Data East. This game of the Turrican series was initially designed for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and later followed by an Amiga port under the title of Turrican 3. However, despite not being the original, the Amiga version was the one that was first commercially released in 1993, published by Rainbow Arts in Germany and Renegade in Europe. The Mega Drive version didn't have a publisher and stayed unreleased until 1994, when Data East carried over its worldwide distribution. Data East itself released the game in North America, and contracted Sony Imagesoft for its distribution in Europe.[CR]The Mega Drive version of the game was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on March 22, 2008 and on April 14, 2008 in North America.[CR]After many generations of peace, the Dark Forces have assembled again, and as Bren McGuire, a member of the USS Freedom Forces, it is your job to defeat them once again. In the future, mankind will have to deal with many powerful alien species - not all of whom will choose to be friendly. That is the reason behind the Turrican suit - a one-man set of power armor that turns any Earth Force soldier into a nearly unstoppable killing machine.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]The player has to complete numerous large levels always searching for secrets to pick up and enemies to shoot. To do this, you can pick up three different, upgradeable shots: a \"Multiple\" spread gun, a more powerful, single-direction \"Laser\" and a \"Rebound\", which fires shots directly up and down that travel along floors and ceilings, while the main forward-firing shot is weaker. You can also go into wheel-mode by pressing jump whilst holding down on the D-Pad (as long as you have enough special energy) and use a rope. In wheel-mode, you are nearly invincible and can lay mines or explore previously unreachable areas, a mechanic similar to \"Morph Ball\" from the Metroid series and the \"Spin Dash\" from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.[CR]Development[CR]The German magazine \"Amiga Games\" published a complete 6 part development diary (The long way from Turrican 2 to Turrican 3) in 1992.[CR]Factor 5 began the work on Turrican 3 for the Amiga right after Turrican II was released in 1991. They had a working demo that already had some features from the final game. However, around this time, the Amiga market was already in decline and together with Rainbow Arts, it was decided to develop the game for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was completely redesigned for the console and it was co-developed by Factor 5 and members of Kaiko. Kaiko then approached Rainbow Arts and asked to develop their own version of Turrican 3 for the Amiga. However, development on this version did not get very far and was stopped after a short time. Development on the Amiga version was restarted, this time as a conversion of the Mega Drive game. The programming was done by Peter Thierolf, formerly of Kaiko (the company was falling apart at the time).[CR]Turrican 3 for the Amiga was finally released in 1993, and even though Mega Turrican for the Mega Drive was finished earlier, its release had to be delayed due to the fact of Factor 5 not having a proper publisher for it. Data East finally published it in 1994.[CR]The main differences between the versions are graphics (the 64 colours of the Mega Drive version had to be downconverted to 32 for the Amiga) and sound (the Amiga had the more advanced sound hardware and thus the music tracks sound more impressive on it). The main gameplay difference is that a secret level in Mega Turrican became a regular level in Turrican 3. In general terms, the game features much smaller levels to the original Amiga Turrican games and has much chunkier sprites, but compensates these with many new effects and graphical improvements, and a major focus on shooting action. The lightning whip from the first two games is gone and is replaced by a grappling hook.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Rope[CR]B Button: Fire[CR]C Button: Jump[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Turrican[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Enter the following code at the Pause Screen:",

First is training mode which explains the basics of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to complete the stage. Second is a \"pin-up\" mode for one player, where clearing blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia tone.",

Space Station Defender: the player has to shoot aliens inside pods which appear on the screen in a given sequence and in specific positions. As the player follows the pattern, he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower end of the screen where \"power\" can be read. There's also a random mode, where all pods appear at the same time and the player has to guess the order in which they'll open. The aliens shoot back if the player takes much time to shoot them. Once in a while a little flying saucer will cross the screen; shooting it will give the player a shield point. The game is over when player's life is depleted.[CR]3. Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!: this game is set in Toejam & Earl's universe. As the screen scrolls right, Toejam has to shoot tomatoes at enemies such as the Cupid, the Dentist, the Boogie Man, the little Devil and so on. There are also special items to shoot, like bombs which will kill all enemies at the screen or tomato baskets which will give ammunition. For each level there's a target score to achieve. In advanced levels the enemies will shoot back. The game is over when Toejam's life is depleted.[CR]4. Whack Ball: this is some sort of a Breakout game. The player controls a paddle and has to bounce a ball against a frame of blocks. Once a block is touched by the ball, its color is changed, and the objective is to change all blocks colors. Some glowing blocks have special effects when hit like sticking the ball to the paddle, giving an extra ball or shrinking the paddle. A time limit is given to each leval, and if the player doesn't succeed, another chance is given. The game is over when all balls are lost though the holes in the frame.[CR]5. Front Line: in this game the player has to shoot tanks, trucks, planes and helicopters before they shoot back. There are two weapons available: a cannon with unlimited ammo and 10 missiles per stage.[CR]6. Rockman's Zone: in this game the player has to shoot cardboard pictures of bandits while avoiding shooting pictures of women, children and policemen. Bonus points are given for acurracy.[CR]In the shooting games the player can choose to have the Accu-Sight on or off. If it is on, a crosshair will be displayed. If it's off, the player can also choose to use the Menacer's Binocular Module.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a     side-scroller released for the Sega Master System and Sega Genesis, loosely based on the film of the same name.   An arcade release running on the Mega-Tech (Mega Drive-based) hardware was later released and despite the identical name, was an entirely different game from the System 18-based    Michael Jackson's Moonwalker arcade game that had been released beforehand.[CR] Moonwalker puts players in the shoes of    Michael Jackson, tasked to rescue children who had been kidnapped by    Mr. Big and his army of  mobsters, vicious dobermans, and    zombies. To rescue the kids, Michael takes on the army of criminals with his dancing repertoire and theatrical magic.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Hitting the attack button causes Michael to send out a fly kick, or throw up his arms in an exaggerated dance fashion. Each of these attacks would send out a burst of magic sparks that extend the range of the strike. Enemies struck by the magic will violently ricochet off the screen before collapsing (akin to the way enemies would go flying in  Battletoads ). [CR] Michael could also use two special attacks to defeat enemies when overwhelmed. Lightly pressing the special attack button would cause Michael to  throw out his hat, which would cause enemies to    explode. However, holding the special attack button would cause all the enemies on screen to line up with Michael and dance to 16-bit renditions of Michael Jackson's most famous hits of the time, such as \"Smooth Criminal\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller.\" These dances, once completed, would cause all enemies onscreen to collapse.[CR] Once Michael has located all the children in the level, Bubbles, Michael's pet monkey, would fly onscreen, sit on the player's shoulder, and point vaguely in the general direction of the level's    boss encounter.[CR] On some levels, Michael can catch a  magical star, transforming him into a    robot, rendering him invincible and capable of firing lasers and missiles to show the enemy no mercy.[CR] In the game's option menu it is possible to listen to all of Michael's songs featured in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 15 Lives[CR]Press Up, Up, Down, Left, Right, A, A, C. Press these at the starting screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 15 Lives[CR]With controller 2, hold up+left+A and press Start. At the press start title screen use controller 1 and press start. Now, when you choose a game you can select a stage but not the subsection (ex. 1-2, 1-3 etc.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip robot battle in round 5-3[CR]It isn't necessary to turn into a robot in order to beat round 5-3. All you have to do is a dance attack affecting 8 or more enemies.  After Mr.Big leaves the scene, and before that little freeze that happens before every boss fight, take a jump and before Michael lands press the magic button.  Keep moving while spinning to where there are more green guards until MJ starts dancing. Getting 8 or more guys dancing will make you win the battle.  If you want to, press one of the buttons during the explosion, to make the star fall and turn you into a robot for no reason. In this stage, hitting any button during the fight causes the star to appears, so the trick is doing so BEFORE the battle begins, the jumping thing is just to get you more time to gather enough enemies to make it work. If you fail, just hit a button and the star will fall anyway.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Moonwalk[CR]In order to moonwalk, all you need to do it to use Michael's kick attack while walking, and if you continue to go the same direction during and after the attack, instead of walking normally, Michael will moonwalk instead.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hear Thriller in the Zombie Stages *REV 00 Only*[CR]In any stage where there are zombies (3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 5-3), if you press and hold the B button then perform Michael's Dance Magic (press and hold A until he dances), instead of the usual tune that plays, a short version of Thriller will play.  Unfortunately, this only works in REV 00 versions of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hear Thriller in the Zombie Stages *REV 00 Only*[CR]In level 5-2, walk up the pair of steps where you first start off. walk to the right until you see the first opening & closing drop .fall through and hold right to land on the surface under it. after that, open the door and rescue child. Then go all the way to the left where you first were but move to the right side of the box door. wait for the star to come and jump up to get it.                [CR]Note: This must be the first child rescued in this level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hear Thriller in the Zombie Stages *REV 00 Only*[CR]On stage 2-3 you can also play as the robot. All you do is go up in the elevator at the start of the stage and open the car that has the child on the first floor. After that you  move a little back and wait for the star to come.",

You can bypass this fight completely by turning around and walking the road backwards; the keep only ''triggers'' if you face it.

This same backwards walking trick can be used to bypass various other difficult encounters, but this is probably the most useful spot.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bypassing Mandaguals Keep[CR]There are a couple of places (dungeons) in the game where the casting of spells has been disabled to make the game harder to beat.

With the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them power to transform into a superhuman fighting force. In time of great need, the young heroes could call upon colossal assault vehicles known as \"Zords\". While the identity of the six remain a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of legend, earning them the title... [CR]The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! [CR]This game plays much like the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers game for the Super Nintendo. In other words, it is very nice. The graphics are great, good quality for the Genesis. The sounds and music are nice. Music from the TV Show is used when playing through different stages. The game-play is superb as well, fighting various enemies and giving you a good time to keep you going for a while. Give this a try if you're a fan of Power Rangers or platform games.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]In this game, you play through six stages of karate-kickin', mighty morphin' action! In the beginning, you can pick the ranger of your choice... [CR]There are six ones you can play as. Tommy the White Ranger, Rocky the Red Ranger, Adam the Black Ranger, Billy the Blue Ranger, Kimberly the Pink Ranger, and Aisha, the Yellow Ranger. [CR]In each stage, you must be able to make it through in the time given. You are usually encountered by a group of baddies, and you are given a starting time of 60 seconds. When you're able to beat them, the clock gives you more time. [CR]Power-ups might also be needed. In this case, Power Coins will be dropped when you defeat enemies. Each one gives a unique reward. [CR]There's also special attacks not listed in the Controls section. To run, tap the desired direction, left or right, twice. To attack when running, press B. When you hold B for a while, you can release it to unleash a more stronger attack.

The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.[CR]",

Monster World IV was never released outside of Japan during the life of the Mega Drive/Genesis, however an English translation patch was released by DeJap Translations and Demiforce on May 29, 2001. Sega eventually created an official English version of Monster World IV which was released on the Wii's Virtual Console on May 10, 2012. The English version of Monster World IV was also included in the Sega Vintage Collection: Monster World on the Xbox 360 and it was released as a stand alone game on PSN.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Monster World IV follows the adventures of a young green haired girl named Asha. One day Asha is listening to the wind when she hears a faint call for help from the four elemental spirits, immediately she begins a journey to aid them.

Now with the help of her new friends Asha must rescue the four endangered spirits and save the kingdom from evil.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Jacket image drawn by Maki OhzoraOn June 22, 2012 the MW Official Fan page on Facebook posted an unreleased song from Monster World IV that was created for an \"Ocean Stage\" that was never made.

However the idea was scrapped due to space limitations on the game's ROM. The boy character was named Eusha, which means \"brave man.\" The girl character eventually evolved into Asha and became the only playable character in the finished game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Menu[CR]When in-game, hold A + C + START on controller 2, then press B + START on controller 1.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GET OVER HERE!Mortal Kombat is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1992 for arcades. After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as \"Mortal Monday\").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic \"X\" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an \"X\" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as \"Finishing Moves\".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called \"Test Your Might\", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three \"endurance matches\" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesGreen Bolt - Throws a pale green fireball at the opponent.Shadow Kick - Throws a mid-kick while quickly moving towards the opponent, trailing pale green shadows behind him.Ball Breaker - Performs a split (a la Jean-Claude Van Damme) and punches his opponent's groin, temporarily stunning them.FatalityUppercut Decapitation - Johnny Cage performs a simple uppercut that punches the opponent's head clean off. In the Super Nintendo version, he impales his foot into his opponent's chest (which is later parodied in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks). In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code enabled), he just performs a simple Shadow Kick. In the Arcade version, it was possible to reset his Fatality, causing him to knock two heads off his opponent (which is somewhat parodied in Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Kano[CR](not available in the Game Gear and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Richard DivizioSpecial MovesKnife Throw - Throws a knife (that glows blue) at his opponent.Cannonball - Rolls up into a ball in mid-air and charges towards his opponent.FatalityHeart Rip - Kano shoves his hand into his opponent's chest and rips out the still-beating heart, which he displays in admiration. In the Super Nintendo version and Sega Genesis version (without the Blood Code activated), he just impales his opponent's chest with his fist. In the Game Boy version, he just glides towards his opponent with a kick.[CR]Raiden[CR](known as Rayden in the SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and PC versions)[CR]Actor: Carlos PesinaSpecial MovesLightning Blast - Throws a bolt of lightning at his opponent.Torpedo - Charges his opponent like a torpedo, chanting nonsensically.Teleport - Phases into the ground and reappears on the other side of the screen.FatalityElectrified Head Pop - Raiden sends jolts of electricity through the opponent's body until the head explodes. In the Super Nintendo version, the opponent is instead electrocuted into a skeleton, which quickly dissolves. In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), the electrocution doesn't do anything special to the opponent. In the Game Boy version, Raiden just turns into a pile of electricity and glides towards his opponent.[CR]Liu Kang[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFireball - Throws a red fireball at his opponent.Flying Kick - Performs a quick air kick that launches towards his opponent.FatalityCartwheel Uppercut - Liu Kang performs a cartwheel that ends with a powerful uppercut, sending the opponent flying. Because the developers wanted Liu Kang to be the \"hero\" character, his Fatality is not considered lethal. (However, it would be lethal on The Pit, as it knocks the opponent over the side of the bridge towards the spikes). In the Arcade and PC versions, it's possible to whiff the cartwheel if the player executes it from a full screen away from their opponent. When this happens, they're free to hit their opponent in any way they see fit, including executing the Fatality a second time. (In the SNES version, however, executing the cartwheel from a full screen away simply causes Liu Kang to cover more distance and come in contact with the victim.)[CR]Scorpion[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpear - Throws a spear at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), he shouts \"COME HERE!\" and drags his opponent towards him, temporarily stunning the opponent.Teleport Punch - Launches himself off one side of the screen and reappears in the other (while throwing a punch).FatalityHellfire - Scorpion takes out his mask, revealing a skull, and breathes fire onto his opponent, who turns into a charred skeleton.[CR]Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesFreeze Ball - Throws a ball of ice at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), his opponent will freeze in a block of ice temporarily, open for another attack. If he attempts to freeze a frozen opponent, this will trigger a \"double freeze\", in which his opponent thaws instantly and Sub-Zero himself is temporarily frozen.Slide Kick - Glides towards his opponent, performing a very low kick.FatalitySpine Rip - Sub-Zero grabs his opponent's head, rips it off (spine attached), and displays it towards the camera. In the Super Nintendo version, he jumps back, performs a more potent freeze on the opponent, jumps forward, and punches the opponent, who dissolves into chunks. (This is later improved on in Mortal Kombat II) In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), Sub-Zero just performs a more powerful uppercut. In the Game Boy version, Sub-Zero just glides towards his opponent with a punch.[CR]Sonya[CR]Actor: Elizabeth MaleckiSpecial MovesRing Toss - Throws a fireball consisting of three purple rings at her opponent.Leg Grab - Performs a handstand and attempts to grab her opponent with her legs. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), she throws her opponent over her with her legs.Square Wave Punch - Jumps straight up, then glides along the air while throwing a punch. (Similar to a square waveform)FatalityKiss of Death - Sonya blows a kiss, which ends up being a fireball that turns the opponent into a charred skeleton.[CR]Goro[CR](sub-boss, only playable in the Game Boy version with a cheat code)[CR] Special MovesFireball - Throws a powerful green fireball at his opponent.Leaping Stomp - Jumps off the top of the screen and lands on his opponent.Chest Pound - Grabs his opponent with his lower arms and wails against the body with his upper arms before throwing the opponent over his shoulder.[CR]Shang Tsung[CR](final boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFlaming Skull - Throws a series of flaming skulls at his opponent.Morph - Temporarily transforms to one of the other seven playable characters. In some occasions, he even transforms into Goro.[CR]Reptile[CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and early Arcade versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpearFreeze BallTeleport PunchSlide KickFatalityHellfireSpine Rip[CR]Arenas[CR]There are six playable stages (seven if the bottom of The Pit for the battle against Reptile is included), which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Goro's Lair is always the stage for Endurance 3, Goro, and Shang Tsung matches. The Pit is the only stage that includes a Stage Fatality, which is performed by a simple uppercut.The Pit. You do not want to know what lies below this bridge...The CourtyardPalace GatesWarrior ShrineThe PitThrone RoomGoro's Lair[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original arcade release of Mortal Kombat went through five revisions on two arcade boards (the Midway Y-Unit and then the Midway T-Unit). Some additions to the versions include the ability for players to play a mirror match, advertisements for promotional material, more blood, increased opponent AI, and the addition of Reptile.Almost a year later, Mortal Kombat was ported to various consoles (mainly Nintendo and Sega consoles), published by Acclaim. To hype the game's original release on home and handheld consoles, Acclaim launched a marketing blitz that labeled the game's September 13, 1993 release as \"Mortal Monday\", featuring the iconic Mortal Kombat theme song, known as Techno Syndrome (Mortal Kombat), in advertisements and promotional material.The original arcade release was later bundled with the special edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was part of Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Super Nintendo Entertainment SystemThe SNES version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Sculptured and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". This version was infamous as it did not contain any violence or gore (not even as a secret cheat code), due to the fact that Nintendo preferred family-friendly games for its consoles. The blood was replaced by a mist-like sweat and most Fatalities (known as Finishing Moves) were heavily censored. Anything involving decapitations or organ removal was significantly altered, although Scorpion, Sonya, and Liu Kang did not have any of their finishers censored.Despite the censorship, the game featured better graphics, sound, and music than most of the other console ports. Details such as the character size relative to the screen, the placement of their names within the life bars, and the composition and usage of the score were faithful to the arcade (even though the instrumentation from the SNES audio chip could not be as crisp as provided through the arcade version's sound chips).However, the gameplay was hampered significantly. Control felt relatively stiff, and it was very difficult to pull off basic combos (such as Liu Kang's jump kick into Flying Kick). In some cases, it felt like there was a slight but noticeable lag between a D-pad press and the resulting move on the screen. If you tapped the d-pad too quickly, it was possible to actually attempt multiple inputs without ever seeing a response on the screen (but it also made it possible to do Scorpion's fatality--up, up--without having to hold Block).Sega GenesisThe Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". It also featured censorship of violence and gore (with Fatalities even more censored than the SNES version). However, the game had a famous Blood Code (ABACABB, a nod to the album Abacab by the band Genesis) that, when entered at the right time, would disable all censorship.Despite being the more popular version due to the addition of the Blood Code, the game featured weak graphics and sound, including missing animations (such as Sub-Zero's idle and walking animations, which now mirror Scorpion's) and heavily modified music.Musically, there are stage-specific songs that are used in the wrong stages (and this seems to be something that occurs in most versions ported by Probe, including the PC version). For instance, in the \"Palace Gates\" stage, which is second in the stage rotation, the music that plays is nothing like what is heard in the original or SNES versions, but in fact sounds like a remixed version of the Continue Screen music. The \"Palace\" stage music does exist in this version, but is instead used in the \"Warrior Shrine\" stage (the next stage over).Curiously, not only is \"The Pit\" stage music completely wrong, it is also the same track that Probe used for the \"Palace Gates\" stage in the PC floppy disk port.In addition, this version is missing the ominous chime when a Fatality is performed successfully; instead, the stage music continues to play until the animation is over. (The voiceover for \"____ Wins\" and \"Fatality\" is also missing.)Game BoyThe Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". Due to technical issues, this version of the game is considered the worst due to poor controls and timing issues. The game also lacked Johnny Cage and Reptile, and was censored to contain no blood or gore.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GET OVER HERE!Mortal Kombat is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1992 for arcades. After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as \"Mortal Monday\").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic \"X\" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an \"X\" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as \"Finishing Moves\".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called \"Test Your Might\", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three \"endurance matches\" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesGreen Bolt - Throws a pale green fireball at the opponent.Shadow Kick - Throws a mid-kick while quickly moving towards the opponent, trailing pale green shadows behind him.Ball Breaker - Performs a split (a la Jean-Claude Van Damme) and punches his opponent's groin, temporarily stunning them.FatalityUppercut Decapitation - Johnny Cage performs a simple uppercut that punches the opponent's head clean off. In the Super Nintendo version, he impales his foot into his opponent's chest (which is later parodied in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks). In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code enabled), he just performs a simple Shadow Kick. In the Arcade version, it was possible to reset his Fatality, causing him to knock two heads off his opponent (which is somewhat parodied in Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Kano[CR](not available in the Game Gear and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Richard DivizioSpecial MovesKnife Throw - Throws a knife (that glows blue) at his opponent.Cannonball - Rolls up into a ball in mid-air and charges towards his opponent.FatalityHeart Rip - Kano shoves his hand into his opponent's chest and rips out the still-beating heart, which he displays in admiration. In the Super Nintendo version and Sega Genesis version (without the Blood Code activated), he just impales his opponent's chest with his fist. In the Game Boy version, he just glides towards his opponent with a kick.[CR]Raiden[CR](known as Rayden in the SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and PC versions)[CR]Actor: Carlos PesinaSpecial MovesLightning Blast - Throws a bolt of lightning at his opponent.Torpedo - Charges his opponent like a torpedo, chanting nonsensically.Teleport - Phases into the ground and reappears on the other side of the screen.FatalityElectrified Head Pop - Raiden sends jolts of electricity through the opponent's body until the head explodes. In the Super Nintendo version, the opponent is instead electrocuted into a skeleton, which quickly dissolves. In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), the electrocution doesn't do anything special to the opponent. In the Game Boy version, Raiden just turns into a pile of electricity and glides towards his opponent.[CR]Liu Kang[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFireball - Throws a red fireball at his opponent.Flying Kick - Performs a quick air kick that launches towards his opponent.FatalityCartwheel Uppercut - Liu Kang performs a cartwheel that ends with a powerful uppercut, sending the opponent flying. Because the developers wanted Liu Kang to be the \"hero\" character, his Fatality is not considered lethal. (However, it would be lethal on The Pit, as it knocks the opponent over the side of the bridge towards the spikes). In the Arcade and PC versions, it's possible to whiff the cartwheel if the player executes it from a full screen away from their opponent. When this happens, they're free to hit their opponent in any way they see fit, including executing the Fatality a second time. (In the SNES version, however, executing the cartwheel from a full screen away simply causes Liu Kang to cover more distance and come in contact with the victim.)[CR]Scorpion[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpear - Throws a spear at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), he shouts \"COME HERE!\" and drags his opponent towards him, temporarily stunning the opponent.Teleport Punch - Launches himself off one side of the screen and reappears in the other (while throwing a punch).FatalityHellfire - Scorpion takes out his mask, revealing a skull, and breathes fire onto his opponent, who turns into a charred skeleton.[CR]Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesFreeze Ball - Throws a ball of ice at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), his opponent will freeze in a block of ice temporarily, open for another attack. If he attempts to freeze a frozen opponent, this will trigger a \"double freeze\", in which his opponent thaws instantly and Sub-Zero himself is temporarily frozen.Slide Kick - Glides towards his opponent, performing a very low kick.FatalitySpine Rip - Sub-Zero grabs his opponent's head, rips it off (spine attached), and displays it towards the camera. In the Super Nintendo version, he jumps back, performs a more potent freeze on the opponent, jumps forward, and punches the opponent, who dissolves into chunks. (This is later improved on in Mortal Kombat II) In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), Sub-Zero just performs a more powerful uppercut. In the Game Boy version, Sub-Zero just glides towards his opponent with a punch.[CR]Sonya[CR]Actor: Elizabeth MaleckiSpecial MovesRing Toss - Throws a fireball consisting of three purple rings at her opponent.Leg Grab - Performs a handstand and attempts to grab her opponent with her legs. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), she throws her opponent over her with her legs.Square Wave Punch - Jumps straight up, then glides along the air while throwing a punch. (Similar to a square waveform)FatalityKiss of Death - Sonya blows a kiss, which ends up being a fireball that turns the opponent into a charred skeleton.[CR]Goro[CR](sub-boss, only playable in the Game Boy version with a cheat code)[CR] Special MovesFireball - Throws a powerful green fireball at his opponent.Leaping Stomp - Jumps off the top of the screen and lands on his opponent.Chest Pound - Grabs his opponent with his lower arms and wails against the body with his upper arms before throwing the opponent over his shoulder.[CR]Shang Tsung[CR](final boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFlaming Skull - Throws a series of flaming skulls at his opponent.Morph - Temporarily transforms to one of the other seven playable characters. In some occasions, he even transforms into Goro.[CR]Reptile[CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and early Arcade versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpearFreeze BallTeleport PunchSlide KickFatalityHellfireSpine Rip[CR]Arenas[CR]There are six playable stages (seven if the bottom of The Pit for the battle against Reptile is included), which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Goro's Lair is always the stage for Endurance 3, Goro, and Shang Tsung matches. The Pit is the only stage that includes a Stage Fatality, which is performed by a simple uppercut.The Pit. You do not want to know what lies below this bridge...The CourtyardPalace GatesWarrior ShrineThe PitThrone RoomGoro's Lair[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original arcade release of Mortal Kombat went through five revisions on two arcade boards (the Midway Y-Unit and then the Midway T-Unit). Some additions to the versions include the ability for players to play a mirror match, advertisements for promotional material, more blood, increased opponent AI, and the addition of Reptile.Almost a year later, Mortal Kombat was ported to various consoles (mainly Nintendo and Sega consoles), published by Acclaim. To hype the game's original release on home and handheld consoles, Acclaim launched a marketing blitz that labeled the game's September 13, 1993 release as \"Mortal Monday\", featuring the iconic Mortal Kombat theme song, known as Techno Syndrome (Mortal Kombat), in advertisements and promotional material.The original arcade release was later bundled with the special edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was part of Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Super Nintendo Entertainment SystemThe SNES version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Sculptured and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". This version was infamous as it did not contain any violence or gore (not even as a secret cheat code), due to the fact that Nintendo preferred family-friendly games for its consoles. The blood was replaced by a mist-like sweat and most Fatalities (known as Finishing Moves) were heavily censored. Anything involving decapitations or organ removal was significantly altered, although Scorpion, Sonya, and Liu Kang did not have any of their finishers censored.Despite the censorship, the game featured better graphics, sound, and music than most of the other console ports. Details such as the character size relative to the screen, the placement of their names within the life bars, and the composition and usage of the score were faithful to the arcade (even though the instrumentation from the SNES audio chip could not be as crisp as provided through the arcade version's sound chips).However, the gameplay was hampered significantly. Control felt relatively stiff, and it was very difficult to pull off basic combos (such as Liu Kang's jump kick into Flying Kick). In some cases, it felt like there was a slight but noticeable lag between a D-pad press and the resulting move on the screen. If you tapped the d-pad too quickly, it was possible to actually attempt multiple inputs without ever seeing a response on the screen (but it also made it possible to do Scorpion's fatality--up, up--without having to hold Block).Sega GenesisThe Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". It also featured censorship of violence and gore (with Fatalities even more censored than the SNES version). However, the game had a famous Blood Code (ABACABB, a nod to the album Abacab by the band Genesis) that, when entered at the right time, would disable all censorship.Despite being the more popular version due to the addition of the Blood Code, the game featured weak graphics and sound, including missing animations (such as Sub-Zero's idle and walking animations, which now mirror Scorpion's) and heavily modified music.Musically, there are stage-specific songs that are used in the wrong stages (and this seems to be something that occurs in most versions ported by Probe, including the PC version). For instance, in the \"Palace Gates\" stage, which is second in the stage rotation, the music that plays is nothing like what is heard in the original or SNES versions, but in fact sounds like a remixed version of the Continue Screen music. The \"Palace\" stage music does exist in this version, but is instead used in the \"Warrior Shrine\" stage (the next stage over).Curiously, not only is \"The Pit\" stage music completely wrong, it is also the same track that Probe used for the \"Palace Gates\" stage in the PC floppy disk port.In addition, this version is missing the ominous chime when a Fatality is performed successfully; instead, the stage music continues to play until the animation is over. (The voiceover for \"____ Wins\" and \"Fatality\" is also missing.)Game BoyThe Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". Due to technical issues, this version of the game is considered the worst due to poor controls and timing issues. The game also lacked Johnny Cage and Reptile, and was censored to contain no blood or gore. However, this is the only version where Goro is made playable through a cheat code.Sega Game GearThe Sega Game Gear version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on \"Mortal Monday\". It resembles much like an improved Game Boy version, featuring faster gameplay, color, and tighter controls. Like the Sega Genesis version, the game was censored until the player enters a hidden Blood Code. Kano and Reptile were absent from the game.Sega Master SystemReleased exclusively in Europe, the Sega Master System version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim in 1993.

The game also features video from the \"Mortal Monday\" advertisements and some tracks from the music CD as bonus content. However, due to the nature of CD-based games, the game suffered from load times (even during endurance matches and the Shang Tsung match). The manual for the Sega CD version also included tidbits from the comic book series.PCThe PC version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Midway and Probe, and published by Acclaim in mid-1994 and is considered the most faithful port in terms of graphics and gameplay.

The CD version, however, featured authentic music and sounds and is considered the best home version for its time.AmigaThe Amiga version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Virgin in 1994. The game plays similar to the Sega Genesis version, complete with censorship that can be bypassed with the Blood Code. Due to the limited controls on the Amiga, all moves can be performed with the joystick and one punch button. (Though a second button can be used as a kick button) The game suffered from loading times and a sub-par arranged soundtrack.Plug It In & Play TV GamesIn 2004, JAKKS Pacific released Mortal Kombat as part of their Plug It In & Play TV Games lineup. The port, developed by Digital Eclipse, is a slightly watered-down version of the Arcade version, including cheap MIDI music and lack of scrolling backgrounds and flashing text.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Raiden decides to take a vacation.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 (known in some promotional material simply as MK3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Midway on April 1995 for arcades.[CR]Although not as popular as the previous  Mortal Kombat games (and was criticized by fans due to the change of scenery and bland character roster), the game was a commercial success, adding new gameplay innovations to the franchise such as the Run button, different difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos,  Animalities, mid-fight stage transitions, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special pre-match codes known as \"Kombat Kodes\". The game was later overshadowed by its upgrade:  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.[CR]Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's \"cyber-assassin\" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Mortal Kombat \"X\" Control Panel with the new run button[CR]The gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a \"Run Meter\", which limits the use of running.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a \"chain combo\" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny![CR]The game also introduces the concept of \"Choose Your Destiny\", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different \"towers\", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).[CR]In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a \"Kombat Kode\") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.[CR]When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\"). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character.Finishing MovesANIMALITY![CR] Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).[CR]Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Characters and Actors[CR] The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)[CR]The game includes fourteen playable starter characters, two unplayable bosses, one playable secret character, and one unplayable secret opponent. Jax, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, and Shang Tsung return from Mortal Kombat II alongside Kano and Sonya from the original Mortal Kombat as starting playable characters. Each character from the previous games have a different appearance, such as Jax's metal arms and an un-masked Sub-Zero. Shao Kahn returns from Mortal Kombat II as the game's final boss.[CR]The other playable starter characters include the  palette swaps Cyrax and Sektor (Lin Kuei cyber-assassins sent to kill Sub-Zero), Kabal (a former warrior of Kano's clan), Nightwolf (a North American  shaman), Stryker (a  riot control officer), Sheeva (a female  Shokan warrior), and the resurrected Sindel. Motaro replaces  Kintaro as Shao Kahn's bodyguard and penultimate boss.[CR]The game includes two secret characters, one of which (Smoke from Mortal Kombat II as an indoctrinated cyber-assassin palette swap) is unlocked as a playable character via an \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\". The other, Noob Saibot (also from Mortal Kombat II), can only be fought through a special \"Kombat Kode\". Although we're given the impression that Noob Saibot is a ninja (similar to Mortal Kombat II), he is simply a palette swap of Kano in this game. Shang Tsung - John Turk Sindel - Lia Montelongo Jax - John Parrish Kano - Richard Divizio Liu Kang - Eddie Wong Sonya - Kerri Hoskins Stryker - Michael O'Brien Smoke - Sal Divita (secret character) Sub-Zero - John Turk Cyrax - Sal Divita Sektor - Sal Divita Nightwolf - Sal Divita Sheeva - Stop-motion miniature Kung Lao - Anthony Marquez Kabal - Richard Divizio Motaro - Stop-motion miniature (boss, unplayable) Shao Kahn - Brian Glynn (final boss, unplayable) Noob Saibot - Richard Divizio (secret opponent, unplayable)Arenas[CR]There are eleven playable stages (thirteen if Noob Saibot's Dorfen is counted, where the player fights Noob Saibot, and Hidden Portal, where they fight Smoke), which is built into a simple, looping rotation. However, The Balcony is always the stage in Motaro matches and The Pit 3 is always the stage in Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include Stage Fatalities are The Subway (in which the player uppercuts the opponent into the adjacent tracks, who gets run over by a subway car), The Bell Tower (in which the player uppercuts the opponent down the Bell Tower through many floors, who then gets impaled by spikes), and The Pit 3 (in which the player uppercuts the opponent over the side of the bridge and into rotating blades below).[CR]A new addition to Mortal Kombat stages is mid-match stage transitions, where a simple uppercut can knock the opponent up into another stage. The Subway transitions to The Street, The Bank transitions to The Rooftop, and The Soul Chamber transitions to The Balcony. The Subway  The Bank The Street The Graveyard  The Rooftop The Balcony The Bridge The Soul Chamber The Bell Tower The Church The Graveyard The Pit 3[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]16-bit conversions for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo were released on September 8, 1995, along with a Game Boy version as well. A rare Game Gear version of MK3 was made but only saw a release in Japan and Europe. MK3 was an early member of the Sony PlayStation library, as a 32-bit conversion was released on October 7, 1995, less than a month after the PlayStation launched in North America. As part of its battle with Sega Saturn over the 32-bit market, Sony bought exclusive rights from Midway to release the game on 32-bit consoles. As a response, Sega purchased exclusive 32-bit rights to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Two versions of MK3 were released for PC. One version was strictly made for DOS. The other version was the PlayStation version ported over for Windows. An emulated version of the game was included on Midway Arcade Teasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2004. It also was featured on Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PSP in 2005 and Midway Arcade Teasures Deluxe Edition for the PC in 2006. Deluxe featured a 1995 10-minute documentary about the making of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheats[CR]Enter the following after the bell rings at the Mortal Kombat 3 logo:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheats[CR]At the start screen, press the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Versus Screen Codes[CR]At the versus screen before the match, Player 1 enters the 1st 3 digits while Player 2 enters the last 3.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Advertisement featuring four of the new playable charactersMortal Kombat II is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1993 for arcades. Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic \"Toasty!\" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an \"X\" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut).Finishing MovesBaraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no \"endurance matches\" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the \"?\" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the \"Toasty!\" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row). [CR]         Liu Kang [CR]Actor:  Ho Sung PakFatality 1: Liu Kang morphs into a screen-high dragon before biting down on his opponent, leaving behind only a standing pair of legs.Fatality 2:  Liu Kang revisits his non-lethal fatality from the original Mortal Kombat, executing a butterfly-kick into the opponent before uppercutting him or her into the air.[CR]         Kung Lao [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Anthony MarquezFatality 1: Using a downward slash, Kung Lao bisects the victim with the brim of his hat. The victim falls to his or her knees before splitting apart down the center in two opposing directions.Fatality 2: Kung Lao throws his hat from a distance with a slight upward arc, catching the victim just under the neck and decapitating him or her.[CR]         Johnny Cage [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Cage rips the torso off of his victim and tosses it away, leaving only a pair of standing legs.Fatality 2: Cage revisits his fatality from the original game, using an uppercut to decapitate his victim. A special button combination can be executed during the fatality to guarantee that two more heads are punched off (out of thin air, natch).[CR]         Reptile [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reptile removes his mask, revealing his true reptilian face. He then opens wide, snaring the opponent's head with his long tongue, rips it clean off, and eats it.Fatality 2: While invisible, Reptile pops his victim's torso up into the air and away from the legs.[CR]         Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Sub-Zero freezes his victim in showers of ice. He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an \"ice grenade\" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs.[CR]         Shang Tsung [CR] (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he \"bursts out\" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand. What remains of the victim is a shriveled, desiccated body.Hidden Fatality: Shang Tsung morphs into Kintaro and, with one powerful punch, knocks his victim's torso clean off of his/her legs.[CR]         Kitana [CR]Actor:  Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Kitana whips out her razor-sharp fan and decapitates her victim.Fatality 2: Kitana plants a lovely kiss on her victim which in fact causes the victim's body to expand to the point of explosion.[CR]      Jax [CR]Actor:  John Parrish Fatality 1: Jax claps both of his hands on the victim's head, causing it to shatter into pieces.Fatality 2: Jax grabs ahold of both of his victim's arms and rips them off with one yank. The victim then stands in shock as showers of blood gush through his/her arm sockets. The victim doesn't immediately die (of blood loss).[CR]         Mileena [CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Mileena pulls out both of her sai and, in rapid-fire style, repeatedly stabs her victim in the torso, leaving behind a massive spray of blood.Fatality 2: Mileena removes her mask, revealing Tarkatan teeth. She then inhales her victim, then turns around and spits out a plethora of shiny bones.[CR]         Baraka [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Richard Divizio Fatality 1: Baraka decapitates his victim with one swipe of his arm blades.Fatality 2: Baraka unleashes both of his arm blades and impales his victim through the chest. As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air.[CR]         Scorpion [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs.[CR]         Raiden [CR] (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes.[CR]        Kintaro [CR](sub-boss, unplayable)[CR]        Shao Kahn [CR](boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor:  Brian Glynn [CR]        Jade [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar[CR]        Smoke [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]       Noob Saibot [CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]Arenas[CR]There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Shao Kahn's Arena is always the stage in Kintaro and Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include special Stage Fatalities are The Dead Pool (where the player uppercuts the opponent into acid), The Kombat Tomb (where the player uppercuts the opponent into previously hidden ceiling spikes), and The Pit II (where the player uppercuts the opponent off the side of the bridge and into the rocky ground below). The Dead PoolThe Living Forest The Kombat Tomb The Wasteland The Tower The Living Forest  The Armory The Pit II The Portal Shao Kahn's Arena [CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original release of Mortal Kombat II on the Midway T-Unit arcade board went through four released revisions (1.1, 1.4, 2.1, and 3.1). While revisions 1.1 and 1.4 were available to the public, they were considered unfinished, missing some Fatalities, some special moves, all endings, all Friendships, all Babalities, all secret opponents, and all Stage Fatalities. Revision 3.1 is the final version, featuring all Fatalities, special moves, endings, Friendships, Babalities, secret opponents, Stage Fatalities, and bugfixes. The arcade release was considered a smash hit, with special guards on the arcade machines to protect the arcade board from being stolen.Almost a year later, the game was ported to various consoles. Home versions hit the market on \u201cMortal Friday\u201d September 10, 1993 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. The SNES version of the original Mortal Kombat was criticized for its lack of blood, so blood was included in the SNES version of MKII. It was featured in the launch library for the Sega 32X when it launched in November 1994. Versions for the PC and Amiga were released in late-1994 as well. Rare versions of the game were released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, and featured excessive loading times. For example, if Shang Tsung morphed into another character, the game would pause mid-match to load this new character, then pause for each consecutive move that required new animations or sound to load in.The original arcade release was later included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam). The game was also included as an unlockable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.On April 12, 2007, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on the PlayStation Network for $4.99, featuring online play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fight against Shao Kahn[CR]Enter the following at the options menu:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fight against Shao Kahn[CR]You have to be on the spiked roof stage (stage 2 usually) Do you character's stage fatality command, and as soon as the fatality \"Du du duuuu\" music starts hold down.

The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.[CR]The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.[CR]Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls).[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Back in 1993, Electronic Arts decided to take a chance and open up the football market for something other than John Madden Football. Designed around the Madden '93 game engine, Mutant League Football introduced fantasy players and gruesome violence to traditional Madden-style football gameplay. The first \"Mutant League\" game, a later followup was released in Mutant League Hockey. Mutant League Football was released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the EA Replay compilation in 2006, adding the ability to play wireless multiplayer.[CR]Setting[CR]Most notably the setting, it takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where radiation has caused humans to mutate and the dead to rise from the grave(although it offers no explanation for fantasy elements like skeletons and trolls, but who cares!). The instruction booklet states that the exact reasons for human upheaval were \"lost or corrupted due to, (among other things), the chaos of an alien invasion, spin control, a sloppy filing system set up by a temp, and what appears to be barbecue sauce\".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]Mutant League Football featured both single and multiplayer gameplay across multiple modes. \"Single Game\" allowed for exhibition games against human opponents or AI. \"Playoffs\" was designed so players could select one of the teams and take part in a 16-team playoff series, with a password-backup system allowing for playoffs to be continued mid-season. \"Practice\" mode offered the ability to run offensive plays without a defensive team in order to hone gameplay skills.Death Index[CR]Mutant League Football featured an adjustable pre-game setting known as the \"Death Index.\" Modifying the level of damage inflicted in the game, the Death Index is essentially a difficulty setting, with higher settings increasing the likelihood of player injuries and deaths. Games are won by forfeit when one team does not have enough players to continue.Fields[CR]The playing fields consisted of many different ground types: Ice, Grass, Rock, Toxic Waste, or Rubber. The fields are also littered with traps such as, pits that drop into fire, or open space, landmines, and others.Nasty Audibles[CR]Each team had unique \"Nasty Audibles\" plays that ended up killing, or hurting members of the other team in some way, they ranged from \"Confusion\"(reverse controlled for the opposing team), to throwing exploding balls. Each team could also Bribe The Ref twice a game to make him call penalties on the other team, this would go on for a few plays, or until the player called the \"kill the ref\" play, causing the whole team to tackle the ref until he exploded. This would cause the ref to be replaced with a \"tougher\" one, who would then call a 5-yard \"Ref Bashing\" penalty on the attacking team.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]Teams consisted of Aliens, skeletons, trolls, robots and superhumans. Each team fields 7 players instead of the usual 11. Some team names and player names were humorous parodies if real team and player names. Some examples of the player names were Bones Jackson (play on the fact that he is a skeleton, and also, Bo Jackson), and Scary Ice (Jerry Rice).List Of Team Names (and parodies where appropriate)Maniac ConferenceDarkstar Dragons (San Francisco 49ers)Killer Konvicts (Dallas Cowboys)Misfit Demons (Miami Dolphins)Psycho Slashers (Pittsburgh Steelers)Screaming Evils (Philadelphia Eagles)Slaycity Slayers (Seattle Seahawks)Terminator TollzTurbo TechiesToxic ConferenceDeathskin Razors (Oakland Raiders)Icebay Bashers (Green Bay Packers)Midway Monsters (Chicago Bears)Rad Rockers (New York Giants)Road Warriors (Washington Redskins)Sixty Whiners (the name is a parody of the 49ers but none of the player names are)Vile Vulgars (Minnesota Vikings)War Slammers[CR]The Game also contained 3 all-star teams, one for each conference, and \"Galaxy All-Stars\" containing the best players in the league.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Originally there were plans for a 3rd \"Mutant League\" game, Mutant League Basketball.Madden NFL '09 features an achievement entitled \"Midway Monster,\" which awards 50 gamerscore points when a player named \"Bones Jackson\" is created and placed on the Chicago Bears team.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 6,7,6,7 adding, \"...a fun game with action like you've never seen before. Killer plays like bashing the referee and killing opponents is just part of the fun. The play book is huge and contains some really unique ones...the game is more fun with two players\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Kill the referee[CR]To kill the referee, press A, C, C while the team lines up.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Attack the Cheerleaders[CR]During the Half-Time show, press A to target the cheerleaders, and A again to throw footballs at them.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam Tournament Edition is the second game in Midway\u2019s basketball arcade series, featuring two-on-two fast paced matches with NBA players from the 1993-94 season (1994-95 on consoles). In total, the game featured over 120 NBA athletes and over 40 hidden characters. Improvements include additional power-ups, more detailed player attributes, player substitutions after each quarter, and a new soundtrack. The namesake \"Tournament Mode\" turns off all cheats and powerups, and rewards players with expanded rosters for nearly all teams if the player beats all 27 teams.[CR]In addition to these features, console releases added practice and \u201cjuice\u201d modes, optional game toggles like \"hotspots\" and powerup icons, and an \"injury\" stat that lowers a character's stats. Later console releases ( Jaguar, Saturn, PlayStation) also featured larger character sprites and scaling effects to match those of the arcade version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the \"Turbo\" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.[CR]The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player would send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure your lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.[CR]Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, powerups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the \"???\" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the \"Quick Hands\" and \"Max Power\" powerups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocked 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.[CR]All versions of the game also included \"Powerup\" codes input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These were secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that granted abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.[CR]An owner dipswitch option in the arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up.ConsolesHotspots enabled[CR]Some additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. \"Hot Spots\" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. \"Power-up\" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant \"on fire,\" or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a \"Juice\" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.[CR]The console releases also added an \"Injury\" stat for each player. This stat would increase as the player was repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions were also increased to each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also added a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.[CR]Console releases also include an optional \"Tag Mode\" where you always control the player holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions.Computer AI Analysis[CR]The computer artificial intelligence seems to have two different modes. In one mode (mostly seen in early tournament matches) the computer adopts a more passive defensive strategy. They will rarely ever try to push the player over, and the player can often simply run the length of the court and put up a three, or go for an easy dunk without ever worrying about passing. On offense, they tend to often go for three pointers, and will almost always make them if the player doesn't steal or block the ball first (especially if the player is ahead in score). The AI will rarely ever go inside the paint for a lay up or a dunk in this mode.[CR]In the second mode (mostly seen in later tournament matches) the computer is much more aggressive. They will often try to push the player over, making it almost impossible to progress the ball up the length of the court without passing the ball to the other player frequently. Also, if the player tries to put up a three, they will almost always get shoved by the opposing computer controlled AI player if he is nearby. This makes it hard to get three pointers up, and the player can end up getting pummeled if they do not pass frequently. On offense, the AI will frequently go for dunks and attack the paint. However, if the player leaves them wide open on the perimeter they will pull up a three and make it almost all the time.[CR]In general, AI in the first mode is much easier to deal with than the aggressive second mode. The one advantage the first mode has to the second mode is on the offensive side because they will often go for three pointers and will make them almost all the time meaning they can come back quickly if the player is sloppy on the offensive end. However, because of the second modes extremely aggressive defensive, it is more often than not much harder to deal with. Though if the player can manage to get a huge lead on them, it is a lot harder for this mode to make a come back because they often don't put up three pointers.Always going for dunks is a good strategy when in the lead[CR]However, it is hard to get a big lead on either types of AI because of the Rubber Band AI effect. As the player's lead grows, the probability of making shots becomes progressively lower, while the AI's probability of success progressively increases. One strategy to deal with this is to always go for dunks when you start to get a lead bigger than two possessions (4 points), because dunks have a very high probability of going in. Likewise, never go for three pointers because the probability of a three pointer going in is very small when you have a lead. Also increasing your defense on the perimeter is recommended because the computer's probability of making a three pointer when you have a big lead is nearly 100%. This is why the second computer AI mode is easier to get a big lead on because they tend to not go for three pointers and have tougher defense on the perimeter than they do in the paint.[CR]It is interesting to note that if, in the last seconds before half-time or the end of the match, the computer has the ball and they throw up a full court shot it will always go in (a 100% probability) regardless of the score, but if they advance the ball to half court and shoot it from there their probability of making the shot is significantly reduced. For the player, the probability of making a full court shot is very small, giving the computer a competitive edge at the end of the game. Also in the last ten seconds before halftime or the end of the game the computer will become extremely aggressive (even more so than the second AI mode) regardless of the type of AI the player may be facing. If the player has the ball the computer will sprint full speed towards him/her and try to steal the ball and take a quick shot. So if the player is not careful, the computer can score 4 or 6 points in the final 10 seconds using quick steals and shots.[CR]Teams and Players[CR]NBA Team RostersKevin WillisAtlanta Hawks: Stacey Augmon, Mookie Blaylock, Kevin WillisBoston Celtics: Dee Brown, Dino Radja, Dominique Wilkins ( Xavier McDaniel, Eric Montross)Charlotte Hornets: Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning ( Dell Curry, Hersey Hawkins)Chicago Bulls: B.J.

The two kiwis Tiki and his girlfriend Phee-Phee live happily together with the rest of the colony, until one day Wally Walrus comes to town. Wally captures the defenseless kiwis and carries them off to cages hidden in zoos and parks all over New Zealand. Trapped, they can only await their fate of being eaten by the Walrus![CR]Luckily, while Wally is busy thinking about kiwi meals, Tiki manages to escape from his cage and plans to save his girlfriend Phee-Phee and the rest of the colony. A race against time begins as Tiki battles with Wally's friends in the maze-like worlds of New Zealand's zoos, so that he can finally reach the evil Walrus and save his friends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lives, Continues and Scoring[CR]You start the game with 3 lives. You can get a bonus life at 50,000 points and every additional 20,000 points after that. You lose a life when Tiki is hit or you when you run out of oxygen. You do not have to start the level from the beginning, though. You can resume your game directly where you died. At the beginning of the game you do not have any continues, but after completing stage 2-4 and 4-5 you are awarded a continue.[CR]Each time you destroy an enemy you gain 150 points. Additionally, enemies drop bonuses after being defeated. The bonus items are worth 100 extra points and in some cases you also get a special power from them.[CR]Bonus items include:Fruit: These only give 100 extra pointsWeapons: Bow and Arrow, Bomb, Laser Gun, Plasma Ball.Joystick: This one is only useful for riding balloons. It allows you to control the balloon in a more sophisticated way than you normally can. It allows you to stay in mid-air (you normally have to go either up or down) and change the direction left, right, up and down.Book: The book immediately destroys all enemies on-screen.Potion: The potion grants Tiki temporal invincibility.Stopwatch: All enemies are immobilized for a limited amount of time.Movement[CR]Tiki has four basic abilities: he can shoot his bow, walk, jump and swim.[CR]Jumping can be alternated in height by holding down the button longer or shorter.[CR]When swimming, Tiki only has a limited supply of oxygen. He can attack enemies from the water when coming up for air by squirting water at them.[CR]Tiki is furthermore able to fly with the help of balloons. Balloons can be found scattered around the levels or he can steal them from enemies. There are six different kinds of balloons in total. Each of them has different characteristics.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 21 levels in total. All the levels are set in real life locations in New Zealand.[CR]The game begins in Auckland, then passes through Rotorua, The Waitomo Caves, Wellington Strait, Cook Strait and Hammer Springs to the fi nal confrontation with Wally at Mount Cook. In every level you have to save one of your kiwi friends, until you finally reach your girlfriend Phee-phee. The enemies, however, are not your only problem: There is a time limit for every level. If you are too slow the Time Dragon will descend.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 9 Credits[CR]While the short intro with the kiwis running away plays, press the directional buttons in a clockwise pattern (starting from up) several times. When you have to continue, the number of credits you have will have incresed from 5 to 9.",

It is the spiritual sequel to Nigel Mansell's World Championship.[CR]The game uses a first-person cockpit perspective for its races, and sprite scaling for the actual racing. The driving action is depicted on the bottom half of the screen, while the top half is taken up by a HUD used to display information such as the car's status, location on the track and the player's lap times. The player can choose to run a qualifying lap before starting a course, and may also practice the course to their heart's content.[CR]The game was released on both the Super Nintendo and Genesis in late 1994.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NHL 94 is a vertically oriented ice hockey simulation based on the game engine behind NHLPA 93. NHL 94 makes playable all NHL teams (active at the end of the 1993 season), complete with robust (though incomplete) player rosters, in addition to the East and West conference All-Star teams. Various players attributes (e.g. speed, aggression, shot) are ranked based on a 100 point system and affect the way players perform in the game.[CR]New Features Introduced[CR]These features were added from EA Sports previous game NHLPA 93:Goalie ControlShootout GamePenalty ShotsBench and Board Checks3 or 4 Player Compatible with Adapter (5 players on SNES)1992-93 Player Ratings & RostersVariable Player Ratings when on Hot/Cold StreaksSave Player Records for each playerSave User Standings and RecordsOne-times and Special Moves by Selected PlayersNew Player StatsFlip PassesReverse-Angle ReplayClear the zone while killing penaltiesAutomatic Line Changes (can manually change lines at play stoppage)Tougher Computer DefenseTougher GoaliesComputer Shooting Scoring MovesPlayer and Team CardsPlayer Profiles with 144 Player PicturesLogan Organ Music matches Home ArenaTeam logos at center iceNew crowd animationsNo fighting or bloodPeriod StatsMore kinds of game statsTwo expansion teams (Anaheim and Florida)[CR]Innovation[CR]NHL 94 has been lauded as one of the best sports games ever made. It improved on the innovative NHLPA 93 engine, adding smoother sprite animation and a host of new gameplay mechanics. Perhaps the most important of the newly introduced gameplay features was the ability to perform a one-timer. (For non-initiated, a one-timer is when you pass the puck to a player and the intended recipient shoots the puck immediately, without pause.) The one-timer proved to be one of the most accessible scoring options in the game. Scoring was also made easier by the inclusion of a more robust deke mechanic with NHL 94 (at least in the SNES version of the game). In addition, gamers were also able to save their user records.[CR]NHL 94 also evolved from its predecessor by reducing the frequency of slap-shot goals scored through the goalie\u2019s five-hole and stopping the ability to run into the goalie and have the puck your player was carrying drift into the net. Perhaps the most conspicuous feature included in NHLPA 93 and omitted from NHL 94 was the ability to fight your opponents. Fighting returned with NHL 95.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Regular SeasonPlayoffsBest of Seven PlayoffsShootoutExhibition[CR]NHL Teams & Rankings[CR]The following is a chart of the 26 NHL teams featured in NHL 94 and their rankings, strengths and weakness.

The main menu looks rather different from one version to the next, the SNES version adopting a much more basic design. There are also slight graphical differences during gameplay. Possibly the most significant difference is that the SNES version will not track players' statistics from one game to the next (for example, to see which player on your team is leading in goals scored during playoff mode).[CR]Ron Barr's Quotes[CR]Welcome to a sold out {insert arena], home of the [insert home team]Hi I'm Ron Barr for EA Sports... and in goal tonight [goalie name] for [team] and [goalie name] for [opposing team]For [team name], [player name] is on a hot streak, but [player name] is on a cold streak.The [arena] crowd record is [number] db.Hit the Start button to begin, Use the A and C to cycle through menus.Lately [team name] has been playing well ...

The game provided a much more realistic game than most (if not all) other ice hockey video games available until its release.   NHL Hockey was the first  NHL-licensed title on the  Genesis and  SNES, as well as the first game with an official NHL license since the 1980  Intellivision game  NHL Hockey.  The Intellivision title was merely NHL-branded for marketing and featured no official teams in the game.  EA's NHL Hockey does, however, feature licensed teams and logos. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in NHL Hockey is similar to the game's successors.  Players can pass, shoot, and hit, as well as fight.  Fights will occasionally break out after hits and, unlike other games like  Blades of Steel, award no real advantage to the winner of the bout.  The camera perspective is EA's characteristic vertical-scrolling view, rather than most other hockey games of the time which adopted a TV broadcast style.  [CR]EA Hockey[CR]The European release of the game was re-titled as EA Hockey and did not feature the NHL license.  As a result, the teams in the game were national teams.

It was originally released in 1992 for the PC-9801 home computer and ported to various other computers and consoles of the period.[CR]Among the tweaks to the gameplay was the addition of castles, which are now the locations that players must conquer in order to take over new territory. Haouden was also the first game in the series to be given an expansion pack, though this pack would not be available to all versions of the game.[CR]The game was the first flagship Nobunaga's Ambition game to never receive a US localization.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen.[CR]Nobunaga's Ambition is a historical simulation-strategy game that was developed by Yoichi Erikawa, the co-founder of Koei (along with his wife Keiko Erikawa). Erikawa had initially developed the game as a hobby alongside running Koei, which at the time was a chemical wholesaler. However, when he finished the game and had it published, it became such a smash success that Erikawa converted Koei into a video game studio and set to work on video games full-time. For his future projects, Erikawa took on the pen name Kou Shibusawa. Originally released on the PC-8801 and FM-7 computers in 1983, versions have been produced for the PC, NES, Genesis, Game Boy, SNES, and numerous other platforms.[CR]Nobunaga's Ambition is the first in a long-running series of historical strategy games set against Japan's Warring States era. Its title refers to Nobunaga Oda, one of the most powerful warlords of the era, who was on a path to unifying Japan under his rule until his assassination in 1582. In the game, the player attempts to do what Nobunaga could not, and unite all of Japan.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As the title suggests, the player is tasked with achieving the ultimate goal of warlord Nobunaga Oda; the conquest and unification of Japan. Selecting Nobunaga Oda is optional, however, as the player is also able to choose from a variety of other regional daimyos of the era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player may choose from four campaign scenarios including:Battle for the East (beginning in 1560)Daimyo Power Struggles (1560)Ambition Untamed (1571)Road Towards Unification (1582)The territorial map of Japan.[CR]In each scenario, the player must first select a daimyo to play as, and also determine the daimyo's statistics, which are defined by Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm, and IQ. Each statistic is ranked on a hundred-point scale. The progression of time is structured in a turn-based manner. When in the map view, the passing of a turn corresponds to a change in season, and each turn during battle corresponds to the passing of a single day. As time passes, daimyos and officers age and will eventually die of natural causes. As the game progresses, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, encourage a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty.[CR]Battles take place in maps that are divided into 5x10 grids with terrain types such as hills, mountains, villages, rivers, plains, and castles. The player may achieve victory in battle through numerous means, among which include forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.[CR]Outside of battle, the player can make numerous decisions that affect domestic and diplomatic policy as well as military decisions that affect troop strength and allocation. Such actions include transporting soldiers, rice and gold between fiefs, which can be used to strengthen regions at the expense of others. Taxes may be raised or lowered to adjust the income level and the land may be cultivated to boost productivity, though raising taxes or choosing to cultivate will also lead to a decrease in loyalty among the peasants. Expanding a town allows for greater tax income, as well, but also leads to a reduction in loyalty. If loyalty drops too low, the peasants may rise up in rebellion.[CR]To ward against floods, the player can adjust the level of flood control, though the higher the control, the lower the productivity. It is also possible to recruit soldiers or ninja for the military, train the troops, and provide rice to the peasants and troops as a means to raise morale. On the diplomatic side, in addition to going to war, it is also possible to encourage good relations between rival factions by ratifying a non-aggression pact or arranging a marriage. Alternatively, the player can also send spies to keep tabs on rivals or work to win over a rival's own peasants. Merchants can be approached in order to buy weapons, buy or sell rice, or borrow money. It is also possible for the player character daimyo to fall ill, and so if necessary, the player may need to spend time to recuperate.[CR]If a player does not wish to control every aspect of governing, it is also possible to allow the computer AI to govern aspects of selected fiefs.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Nobunaga's Ambition series has garnered several awards over the years. According to Koei's website, various releases in the series have won Log-In magazine's \"BHS Prize\", the \"Minister of Post & Telecommunications Prize\", Nikkei BP's 12th, 13th and 14th annual \"Best PC Software\" awards, and CD-ROM Fan's \"Fan of the Year 2001 Grand Prize\".[CR]In North America, where it was released almost five years after its Japanese release, critical reception was also positive. Evan Brooks of Computer Gaming World enjoyed the game greatly, and in the September 1988 issue rated it as \"Highly Recommended\", with a score of 4/5 stars. He introduced the game as \"a detailed economic / diplomatic / political / military simulation of the unification of Japan in the Sixteenth Century.\" He praised the graphics for being \"among the best that this reviewer has ever seen for the IBM\" and the 5x10 hex map battles, and noted that it used RPG elements, including assigning various statistics and attributes to a selected persona, a time system where each turn represents a year, as the daimyo ages and eventually dies of old age, and a multiplayer option. In his review, he noted, \"This reviewer was glued to his computer for 13 hours, stopping at 3:00 am. Not since Gunship has this occurred. The end result is that the computer gamer must have, at least, one Koei game in his inventory!\" Compute! similarly praised the IBM PC version, calling it \"one of the best strategic war games ever designed for a personal computer\" and citing the game play, user interface, and documentation.[CR] [CR]",

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.[CR]Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. [CR]Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.[CR]The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.[CR]Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \"gold\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.",

Developed by the Sega Technical Institute and published by its parent company, it was originally intended as a launch title for the Sega Nomad handheld, but was instead released as a Genesis game. This game was later added on to Sonic Mega Collection Plus as an unlockable title.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Ooze takes place from an top-down perspective. The main character is a puddle of ooze with a head. He can move around and has two attacks. One is stretching out a steerable pseudopod of ooze whose length is only limited by how much ooze he currently has to attack, which can also be guided around with the control pad. He can also spit gobs of ooze, although this takes off a bit of his puddle. Enemy attacks can cut off a bit of the ooze, and the player will die either if his puddle of ooze is reduced to a very small amount or if his head is attacked directly. He can also die by dropping off the edges of certain areas, or staying on a drain for too long.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Ooze starts with Dr. Caine, an excellent scientist who invented an achromatic odorless toxic gas and its antidote. He sneaked into the research lab where he worked in order to find evidence that crimes were being conducted by using the toxic gas he created. He was discovered by his colleagues and disposed of by means of chemical waste. Little did his former colleagues know that the chemicals did not kill him; instead, they altered him into The Ooze.[CR]Swearing revenge, the doctor sought two things: his former colleagues and to assume his human form once again. He must find the DNA helices scattered throughout the wasteland or else end up in a jar.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage select menu[CR]In the options screen, move towards the sound test area (and be careful not to change the default controller scheme).

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Lester's Lab.[CR]The player takes on the role of  Lester Knight Chaykin, a young physicist who  accidentally manages to destroy his lab and gets himself somehow  teleported onto another world. After a quick exploration of the local area, he is quickly captured by the sentient inhabitants of the planet, a race of bulky, humanoid creatures. Lester then wakes up in a cage with another one of the creatures, looking over what appears to be a mining complex.[CR]He quickly escapes, eliminating his guard and freeing his companion who proceeds to help Lester leave the complex and get to the surface. It is immediately apparent that the alien race was using their own as slaves, and that they operated as a Roman-esque society, albeit with lasers, complete with a Colosseum and a harem. Lester is eventually caught and nearly killed by one of the creatures, but he manages to defeat his attacker and is saved by the very companion he freed at the start. Lester and his companion then ride an enormous bird-like creature off into the distance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The laser in use.[CR]Out of This World uses 2D  side-scrolling mechanics, similar to most platformers released at the time. As such, the player could move both left and right, run, jump, crouch, and at some points use a  laser gun. The gun allows the player to both create charged shots and shields. Because Lester can only survive one hit before dying, and in early parts of the game it is entirely possible for the gun to run out of ammo, precision and care are needed when attacking enemies. Although inefficient, the game includes a password system, which affords the player the ability to continue on from previous  checkpoint.[CR]There are many points where the player must solve complex  puzzles in order to proceed, often involving trial and error. Notable is the  lack of a HUD; there is no  score, no lives system, no map, no  ammunition count, no  inventory.[CR]The Game-world[CR]As there are no explanatory  cutscenes or dialogue, players must figure out for themselves what the nature of the place is, and its true location. There is a clue toward the end which suggests that the world where the player character was transported to may not be what it first appears, although that interpretation is left up to the player.[CR]From the outset, the region of the world where the game takes place seems to be arid and largely desolate. Animals and plants tend to be brutal and predatory, and the sentient life forms conduct gladiatorial games and what appears to be forced labor, as noted earlier. These traits may be evident of a Roman Empire level of culture in terms of art and architecture, although the architecture may be more comparable to medieval Muslim architecture in the  middle-east. Although their culture may be primitive by human standards, their technology is certainly not. They possess a greater understanding of energy and how to harness it, evident in  power nodes which are dotted around the city, but also in their weaponry, which can  stun on the lowest setting and is otherwise lethal. They also possess flying vehicles that supersede technologically anything humanity has built so far.[CR]Original Production[CR]Rotoscoping models used by Eric Chahi.[CR]Animation of the principle characters was performed through a process called  rotoscoping, whereby real objects were used as models for animation work, lending a life-like and quirky feel to the movement that might seem flat and predictable if animated through simple physics models. Allegedly, Lester's appearance is based on  Eric Chahi. However, because Chahi found it disturbing to see himself in the game, he decided to change Lester to a Redhead.[CR]The game was originally, officially released for  PC (DOS),  Amiga,  Atari,  Macintosh,  3DO,  SNES,  Genesis and the Sega CD. The Atari and Amiga versions were developed first. They are relatively shorter compared to later versions, and have a higher  difficulty level due to more precise timing required of the player. The PC version was the first to introduce a whole new level in the middle to latter third of the game to help lengthen the game and strengthen the narrative.[CR]Further obstacles were added for the Genesis and SNES console ports, as  Interplay purportedly wanted players to get as much gameplay as possible for their dollar.  Nintendo also had demands about certain scenes which were considered to be inappropriate for minors (which amounted to a few pixels worth of deletions during a bathhouse scene; as well as changing reddish ichor, which might be interpreted as blood, to green).[CR]The Sega CD version of the game included a game set in the same world, dubbed  Out of this World 2: Heart of the Alien, which took place from the point of view of the aliens. Eric Chahi has stated, however, that this in-house Interplay project suffers in terms of animation quality and its value as a game, as he was not involved in the project.[CR]Eric Chahi has stated that the problem with some of the early enhanced versions was that the backgrounds were a lot easier to improve than the characters themselves. In order to enhance the characters, new rotoscoping or detailed, frame-by-frame enhancement of the animations would have to be done, while the backdrops could be repainted with relative ease. Doing the latter without the former, though, would result in the characters in the foreground looking flat. For the 3DO version, Chahi says, this is especially apparent.[CR]The enhancement of the animations themselves could probably not be done because processors of the time could not handle so many frames of animation being very detailed, although currently such restrictions are negligible.[CR]In addition to the listed versions, there were also unofficial ports to both the  GBA and GP32 systems.[CR]Sequel[CR]Though fans have been hoping for a true sequel, Chahi has stated that he wishes for the game to have no continuation as he wants the ending of the original to remain ambiguous and fans could make their own conclusion to the franchise.[CR]\"I think the story is complete. It has a lot of mystery, so doing a sequel would be very tricky. It could break the magic it has.\"[CR]- Eric Chahi[CR](Retro Gamer issue #96, 2011)[CR]Despite this, a sequel was made for the Sega CD in 1994 called  Heart of The Alien, which placed Buddy as the main protagonist. Chahi was not involved with the development and dismissed the \"sequel\" to be non-canon.[CR]Availability[CR]The original game is not easy to find, but a new, high resolution version is available as a demo, or a full version for 7 Euros (at the time of this writing) from the creator Eric Chahi on  his website. The new version has more detailed backgrounds, multiple graphics modes, more save points and Windows XP and Vista compatible.[CR]Telco Games also distributes a mobile phone version of the game.15th Anniversary Edition[CR]The 15th Anniversary Edition is also available from GOG.com and comes with a selection of extra content, including:manual (17 pages)2 HD wallpapersdevelopment diarytechnical handbooksoundtrack\"making of\" video20th Anniversary Edition[CR]In 2011, in commemoration of its 20th anniversary, Out of This World was made available for the iOS (iPhone and iPad) and later Android.

As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats.

                "plot": "[CR]Development[CR]The inspiration behind the development of OutRun was born out of two things. The first was to overturn Namco, the developer (at the time) of the hugely successful Pole Position and a company synonymous with racing titles, to make Sega Japan's leading manufacturer of racing games. The second, surprisingly, was Yu Suzuki's love of the Burt Reynolds movie Cannonball Run. Suzuki states \"The main impetus behind OutRun's creation was my love of a film called Cannonball Run. I thought it would be good to make a game like that.\"[CR]Suzuki took the development process very seriously and wanted to visit the locations where the courses and levels of his game would pass through. The film Cannonball Run is a pan-American road-race and Suzuki made plans to follow the same course and collect photographic, video and audio data along the way. However, he quickly realized there was a problem:[CR]\"The film crosses America, so I made a plan to follow the same course and collect data as I went. But I realized, once I'd arranged everything, that the scenery along the course actually doesn't change very much so I revised my plan and decided to collect data in Europe instead...\"[CR]Innovations[CR]OutRun departed significantly from Namco's popular Pole Position formula. This is most significant in how OutRun moved the setting away from the racing circuits towards the streets, with oncoming traffic, making it the first true street racing game, paving the way for modern street racers such as Need For Speed and Burnout.Force Feedback[CR]There were four versions of the OutRun arcade cabinet, Deluxe and Standard moving models, an upright with a force-feedback wheel and a cockpit version without any movement.[CR]The early classic Arcade machine for OutRun, featured force-feedback. If the side of a wall was hit the player would get a slight jolt, but completely wipe out and reveal the mistake to everyone else present. The rumble brought a sense of immersion that most other arcade games lacked at the time.Multiple Paths[CR]OutRun also featured a unique way to play through the game. At the end of each area (or checkpoint) the road would fork left and right. The way the player chose to go would decide if the next track is more difficult or less difficult. Some areas and paths were much more difficult than others, so it is best to choose wisely. Each path features different endings, most of which are often humorous.Gradient[CR]Out Run was the first racing game to introduce the use of gradients, with the car climbing uphill and downhill along the course. The camera angle through which the player views the car was also significantly lower than other racing games, with a more over-the-shoulder viewpoint directly behind the car, giving it the feel of being in a car where the driver cannot see what is above or below a certain gradient, thus keeping the players always on their toes and bringing more excitement to the gameplay. The game was praised for these innovations.[CR]Success[CR]The game's main competitor in 1986 was rival Konami's more traditional WEC Le Mans, which was initially the favourite at the time for its more sophisticated hydraulic cabinet. It was OutRun, however, which went on to become the much more popular game, selling more than 20,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, for hundreds of millions of dollars, along with ports to numerous home platforms.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Options[CR]At the title screen, press Start, and then press A eleven times, press B three times, and C eight times.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]OutRunners was seen as a return to form for the Outrun series. The first game had multiple routes to take and was primarily a time based racer. While the second game had a more serious approach to racing. OutRunners wanted to bring back the same gameplay from OutRun, mainly the choice of routes during races. OutRunners brought multiplayer to the normal OutRun formula, where multiple arcade cabinets were used for this purpose, allowing up to eight players to race against each other.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You will see a variety of locations[CR]A race in OutRunners begins in a central location, and each time you come across a checkpoint you are able to turn left or right to change your route. OutRunners takes you through locations all around the world, and the routes will take you across different hemispheres of the world depending on your route. In a two player game you are racing another person the end of a race, and who ever is in first is able to choose the route the race may follow. In a single player game you do not compete against a computer controlled opponent. Single player races are played similarly to the original OutRun where you are simply racing the clock.[CR]There are multiple vehicles to choose from in OutRunners which is a first in the series. In the arcade release there are 8 different vehicles to choose from, and each has its own specific statistics. The statistics mainly cover the speed and handling of a vehicle. Each vehicle also bares a resemblance to some real live vehicles. The cars include Easy Handling, Smooth Operator, Bad Boy, Quick Reactor, The Road Monster, Mad Power, Wild Chaser and the Speed Buster. Each car is also piloted by two different characters to add a bit of personality to the cars.[CR]A returning aspect of OutRun to OutRunners is the music in the game. In the original you were able to choose the music that you wanted to hear throughout your game. In OutRunners there is entire radio station where you can change the music to your liking. The music used is usually associated to the different locations throughout the game.[CR]Arcade hardware[CR]The 32-bit Sega System Multi 32 arcade hardware was used:Main CPU: NEC V70 (32-bit @ 20 MHz)Additional CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit @ 8.1 MHz)FM Sound Chip: Yamaha YM3438 (@ 8.1 MHz)PCM Sound Chip: Sega MultiPCM (@ 8.1 MHz)[CR]Port[CR]Data East ported OutRunners to the Sega Genesis, and it retained all the same gameplay and elements. The graphics however had to be scaled down in order to fit the systems hardware. This version was given a bonus secret vehicle that was not in the arcade version, and that was the Vertua Formula form Virtua Racing.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as the Virtua Formula[CR]One the title screen, take controller one and enter this code: LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, C, A. You'll hear a noise if it worked. Press START and choose the Arcade Mode with button C. To the left of the first car is the Virtua Formula. Wait for the pictures and stats of the cars and you'll eventually see the Virtua Formula Car. (Note: This trick works on an early version of the game. It may or may not work the same on later versions.)",

It is based somewhat on Namco's earlier game Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, an Arcade and Super Famicom game released the previous year.[CR]Pac-Attack has been released on many different systems. The original version was released on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis in late 1993, closely followed by the Game Boy and Game Gear versions. An enhanced port was released on the Philips CD-i with the name Pac-Panic. It has also been released in many Namco and Pac-Man compilations, and the SNES version was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Pac-Attack Screen[CR]The object of the game is to clear rows of blocks by getting them into straight lines; however, most of the falling puzzle pieces also have ghosts attached which take up valuable space where blocks could be stored. The solution to this problem is Pac-Man himself. Every once in a while a Pac-Man piece will fall, and all the ghosts on the board will turn blue. If the Pac-Man piece is situated in an area where he can easily catch any ghosts he will remove them from the grid.[CR]The game offers a standard \"Normal Mode\" in which the game plays out as described above, as well as a \"Puzzle\" mode in which the player is given a limited number of Pac-Man to eat the various ghosts.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8,7,7,8 and 8 out of ten. Mike Weigand wrote, \"No, don't laugh, just try it! This game looks like nothing but once you start playing you will not be able to stop! The three games are addictive, and the two-player competition will have you and a friend playing until you drop!\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]This password will allow you to use a music test and some other options in the game.",

It takes elements from Pac-Land, the Pac-Man themed side-scrolling platformer that is thought to be one of the earliest examples of the genre, as well as elements from the official TV show such as Pac-Man's family.[CR]The game was released for both the Super Nintendo and Genesis in 1994. In Japan, the game is known as \"Hello! Pac-Man\", due to how the player has to communicate directions to Pac-Man to solve puzzles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player is equipped with a sling shot and can shoot at points of interest to bring them to Pac-Man's attention. The player may also tell Pac-Man which way he should go. Pac-Man, however, has a mind of his own and will grow increasingly frustrated if the player leads him into harm's way too many times, and he might just completely ignore the player if he gets too angry. The game also contains super pellets which can be given to Pac-Man at any point to have him transform into Super Pac-Man. In fact, when the ghosts appear throughout random points in the game, Pac-Man is left in paralyzing fear. If the player has run out of super pallets before eliminating all the ghosts, Pac-Man faints.[CR]In the first stage of the game, Pac-Man is tasked with stopping by the farm and picking up milk for Baby Pac. The next section of the game leads Pac-Man to the mountains in search of a flower for Lucy. This section also contains a hand-gliding section in which the player guides Pac-Man in the proper direction. In the third section, Pac-Man must retrive Pac Jr.'s stolen guitar which leads Pac-Man to the city and eventually to a mine cart section that controls much like the hand gliding section. The final stage begins with a broadcast of the ghosts stealing all the ABC gum in the city followed by a message from the Ghost Witch of Netor who goes onto warn Pac-Man of her near completed Gum Monster. Pac-Man must search for the abandoned factory which houses the Gum-Monster and turn into Super Pac-Man to defeat it and all the ghosts. Upon defeating the Gum Monster Pac-Man is congratulated by his friends, family, and the citizens town, but then scolded for not being able to save their ABC gum.Hidden Arcade Classics[CR]Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures also contains two in game video arcades where a NES based version of the original Pac-Man can be played. The player can also participate and complete in an optional side-quest in search of three cartridge pieces which together unlock either Ms. Pac-Man in the SNES version, or Pac-Jr in the Mega Drive/Genesis version.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] View Completion Percentage[CR]Press Start to display the item description screen.

It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the \"Training Course\", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger Lurks[CR]Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.[CR]Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.Incarnations[CR]There have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers![CR]If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.[CR]A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.[CR]The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR]",

Achieving certain objectives during the run, like foiling a criminal mid-robbery, will put the Paperboy on the front page of the newspaper that appears at the end of the stage.[CR]",

The game takes the basic template of the 1982 original and expands on it, offering a greater variety of enemies, various environmental hazards, and power-ups, along with of course updated 16-bit graphics and sound. The goal is still to push blocks and crush enemies. Enemies now appear from generators, which must be destroyed to stop new enemies from appearing, and all enemies must then be eliminated to complete each stage.[CR]In addition to the main story mode, the game also features a competitive battle mode for up to four players, as well as a conversion of the original arcade game.",

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).[CR]The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]wise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Palmer Setting[CR]To get access to the Palmer setting (where the swing bar goes really, really fast but long), make a new character named ''Arnie P'', and select him twice for a single game. You now have access to the secret ''Palmer setting''. [CR][B]WARNING: PLEASE TRY IT BEFORE YOU MESS WITH IT. IT HAS POWER BUT HARD TO HIT![/B]",

                "plot": "[CR]Phantasy Star III has always been the most controversial of the critically-acclaimed Phantasy Star series of RPGs. Rieko Kodama, series director and one of Sega's most successful designers, planned to take the universe she created in a new direction, broadening its appeal so that even players new to Phantasy Star would be able to enjoy it -- but time, budget concerns, and a brand new team conspired to produce a game that has been consistently labelled the less-polished, \"black sheep\" of the series since its original Genesis release in 1991.[CR]Development[CR]Original Japanese box for \"Successors of Time: Phantasy Star III\".[CR]At the time, Sega was feeling pressure to compete with rival Nintendo, and had cannibalized much of their top talent from the previous Phantasy Star games to form what was to become Sonic Team. The change in focus forced the company to assemble a new group to develop the third Phantasy Star, and they turned to the relatively inexperienced crew that had recently finished the Genesis port of the arcade classic beat-em-up, Golden Axe. Director/Writer and Lead Designer Hirondo Saiki had done some minor development work on Phantasy Star II, but apart from him, none of the Golden Axe staff had any experience with the Phantasy Star series at all. Nonetheless, series director Rieko Kodama felt that the new faces would serve the new, \"fresh\" take on the series.[CR]Plot and Setting[CR]A thousand years before Rhys sets on his adventure; two kingdoms, one led by the swordsman, Orakio, and the other by the sorceress Laya, were engaged in a bitter conflict. A cease-fire was called and a meeting between the two feuding nations wasOrakio and Laya[CR]made in an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully, but the two leaders mysteriously vanished before the meeting could take place. The conflicted sides naturally blamed each other for the disappearance of their leader and all communications between the two were severed. A thousand years pass, and Phantasy Star III's story begins with a blue-haired woman suffering from amnesia washing up on Orakian shores.[CR]Phantasy Star III is set 2,000 years* after the events of Phantasy Star II, which allowed the designers to take very unusual directions with the setting and plot - and they did. Probably the most notable feature was the multiple generations of playable characters, as you chose who to marry and took control of your sons as the story progress - one of the earliest examples of multiple endings in games.One of the links between the worlds of PS III.[CR]You begin the game in an ostensibly medieval setting as Prince Rhys, a descendant of the hero Orakio, about to be married to a mysterious amnesiac, Maia. The wedding goes poorly when Maia is kidnapped by a dragon from the Layan kingdom, and you are thrust into an epic adventure through seven worlds linked through unusual metallic caves. Along your journey you encounter cyborgs, some of them a thousand years old; submarines and airstrips; cities in the sky; and cryogenically-preserved demi-goddesses, eventually uncovering the secret of your world and saving it from a hidden evil.[CR]* - The original Japanese version of PS3 says 2,000 years, but the English version says 1,000. The discrepancy is commonly attributed to translation/localization errors.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]First Generation:Rhys[CR]Rhys: Rhys is the Prince of the Orakian Kingdom of Landen. He is the first playable character in the game and the kidnapping of his fiancee, Maia begins his quest to rescue her from the hands of the Layan Kingdom. Rhys can only use swords, knives, and needles (think rapiers). Due to his Orakian ancestry, Rhys cannot use magical techniques. He's a straight-forward beefy brawler.Lyle[CR]Lyle: Lyle is a very odd man who joins Rhys to help him fix the weather controller on Aridia. He uses staffs and can also use magical techniques, which suggests that he is from Layan ancestry.[CR] Mieu[CR]Mieu: Mieu is an ancient Orakian close-quarters combat android, who uses claws for attacks. Despite being a combat android, she can also cast some magic techniques as well. She has been waiting by a lake for a millennium for a descendant of Orakio to command her. Mieu sticks around through all three generations.Wren[CR]Wren: Wren is an android who specializes in managing and analyzing computer systems and technology. He uses firearms in combat and cannot use magical techniques. He teams up with Rhys in order to fix the weather controller on Aridia and thaw out the entrance to Aquatica. Like Mieu, Wren is also remains a playable character throughout all three generations.Lena[CR]Lena: Lena is the princess of the Orakian Kingdom of Satera who rescues Rhys from her father's dungeon. Since she's Orakian she's a natural with knives and needles, but no magic techniques.[CR] Maia[CR]Maia: Maia was the mysterious woman who washed up on Orakian shores and was taken in by the Royal Family of Landen. She falls in love with and is engaged to Prince Rhys. Her kidnapping is what kicks off the storyline for Phantasy Star III.[CR]Second Generation:Ayn[CR]Ayn: Is the main character of the second generation IF Rhys marries Maia at the end of the first generation. He inherits his father's skills with swords and his mother's ability to cast magical techniques.[CR] Nial[CR]Nial: Is the main character of the second generation IF Rhys marries Lena at the end of the first generations. Since his mother and father are both full-blooded Orakians, he cannot use magical techniques. However, he's a really strong fighter and uses swords, knives, and needles.Thea[CR]Thea: Thea is Lyle's daughter and the princess of Shusoran. After Ayn rescues her from her imprisonment in the dungeon of Lensol, she becomes a valuable ally with her use of twin slicers and magical techniques.[CR]Sari: Sari is the daughter of Lena and the ruler of Landen and Satera. At first she is Ayn's enemy, but she eventually joins him. She can only use swords, knives, and needles.Siren[CR]Siren: Siren is an ancient android who once fought alongside of Orakio a thousand years ago. Since then, he has continued to hold a grudge against Laya's people and has amassed a large army of cyborgs bent on wiping out all of Laya's clan. He's the main antagonist for Ayn's generational storyline.[CR]Ryan: Ryan is the leader of the defensive line against Lune, despite being Layan. He mistakes Nial for being in cahoots with Lune, however once Lune shows up to taunt Nial, he realizes that he and Nial share the same goal and joins up with Nial.Laya[CR]Laya (younger): Laya is the younger sister of the legendary sorceress and the Queen of Mystoke. She is awakened from a millennium old cryogenic sleep by Nial. She joins Nial in hopes of discovering what happened to her older sister, whom she remember leaving with a man brandishing a black sword. She also becomes a party member in the third generation if the player follows the path of Ayn or Aron. She is an extremely powerful user of magical techniques and uses a bow, just like her sister.Lune[CR]Lune: Lune is the general of Laya's (older, not younger) forces. He was banished by Orakio a thousand years ago and immersed himself in a cryogenic coma. Upon awakening from his slumber he has amassed a massive force in order to exact revenge against Orakio and the Orakians. He's the main antagonist for Nial's generational storyline.[CR]Alair: Alair is Lune's sister, who was also in a cryogenic sleep with her brother. She was captured and imprisoned by the Orakian Kingdom of Divisia during an assault. Once Nial rescues her, she manages to persuade her brother to cease his hostilities.[CR]Third Generation:[CR]Sean: Sean is the main character for the third generation IF Ayn marries Thea. He lives in Azura with his parents until it is attacked by Siren. He manages to escape the assault and goes on a mission to stop Siren and save his parents and people. Since he's 3/4ths Layan he's not all that strong, but he's got an amazing command of magical techniques.Crys[CR]Crys: Crys is the main character IF Ayn marries Sari. He lives in Landen until it is discovered that the planet has shifted off its normal course and is now heading into a nearby sun. He heads up a quest to find a way to set the planet back to its normal orbit. Since Crys is 3/4ths Orakian he's an extremely powerful fighter, but he only knows a few magical techniques.[CR]Aron: Aron is the main character IF Nial marries Alair. He lives on Dahlia with his parents, his uncle Lune, and cousin Kara. At the beginning of his generational storyline, his people come into contact with a ship known as Neo Palm (this is Palma from Phantasy Star II) and witness it's destruction at the hands of unknown forces. He and Kara leave to find out what caused Neo Palm to explode. Aron is half Orakian and half Layan a perfect mixture of sword attacks and useful techniques.Adan[CR]Adan: Adan is the main character IF Nial marries Laya. He is the prince of Mystoke, Landen, and Satera. Earthquakes start happening and Adan sets out with his sister Gwyn to discover their origin so he can put a stop to them. Much like Aron, Adan is half-Orakian and half-Layan so he's got a good mix of magical techniques and fighting skills.[CR]Gwyn: Gwyn is Adan's sister and she joins her brother on his quest to stop the mysterious earthquakes. She's also unique amongst the Phantasy Star III cast because she's also a clairvoyant and can see into the future through her dreams. She also has great healing techniques and is a crackshot marksman with her bow.[CR]Kara: Kara is Aron's cousin and the daughter of Lune. In the storylines of Sean and Crys, she's an embittered warrior who joins them because he father won't put up a fight to try and discover the true origins of the Orakian/Layan conflict. Even though she is a full-blooded Layan, she can't use techniques. She does have her father's legendary slicer though. In the storylines of Aron and Adan, however, she's a delicate woman who can both cast techniques and use a slicer in battle.Miun[CR]Miun: Miun is an ancient Mieu-type android, who along with Siren, fought with Orakio a thousand years ago. She is heavily damaged from an unknown battle and wanders aimlessly around the deserts of Aridia during the third generation. She's kept herself alive clinging to the desperate wish of seeing Orakio's face again. If she's approached by one of the third generation main characters with the sword in their possession, she will recognize it and shut down having her wish fulfilled. Mieu will take her legendary claw to use in future battles.Dark Force[CR]Dark Force: Yes, folks, he's back and he looks badder than ever. He's the ancient dark evil of legend who was trapped under the waters of Landen with Orakio's sword. You free him when you recover the sword, and you must use it to destroy him before he destroys the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Some overworld enemies.[CR]Phantasy Star III followed the same basic mold as its predecessor and other early console RPGs. Players moved around the world from a top-down view, and the turn-based battles were first-person. Characters had various statistics which would improve after gaining experience points, and found items and equipment which would improve their abilities. Vehicles make their appearance in the late game, but most of the time you'll be walking through the seven worlds and crawling through lengthy dungeons to get between them or to uncover special items and progress the story.[CR]In the place of the traditional spells and magic were \"techniques\", which cost Technique Points (TP). Each character is able to cast techniques grouped by category (Order, Heal, Time, and Melee), consisting of 4 techniques each. An adjustable grid in shops lets you change the relative strength and success rate of each spell in a group. So, for example, if you want your antidote spell (Anti) to succeed more often, you would adjust the grid so that more power is directed toward Anti, decreasing the power and success rate of the other 3 spells in its category (Heal).[CR]Critical Reception[CR]In the end, Phantasy Star III became most known for the game it wasn't. Fans of the series were looking for a direct continuation, and didn't get it. Critics were looking for the franchise to keep up its many top-notch characterstics, and didn't get that. New players to the series may have wanted a plot that had fewer confusing holes and edits, and they didn't get that either.Maps were barren even by 1990 standards.[CR]Previous games in the Phantasy Star series were noted for their vibrant colour, science-fiction atmosphere, detailed and well-animated enemies, and extensive character development. Phantasy Star III was perceived to have fallen short on nearly every front. The rushed development resulted in a game with a number of bugs, a lackluster English translation, game maps (towns, castles, dungeons, etc) with little to no decoration, uninspired dungeon design, barely animated enemies, and a learning curve that seemed to be more of a waterslide than a hill.[CR]Despite these extensive flaws, the game still had its attractions. The game's generation system got a lot of attention, and the characters and world design tantalizingly and frustratingly hinted at the depth left unable to shine by the game's many development constraints. The game's music, by Izuho Takeuchi (credited as \"Ippo\"), at times haunting and medieval, at others driving and electric, was often mentioned as the game's best feature. Takeuchi would be the only team member to return for Phantasy Star IV.[CR]Connections to Phantasy Star I and II[CR]Warning: This section contains major plot spoilers.[CR]The seven linked worlds are actually separate, huge compartments of a spaceship, named the Alisa III - after the female protagonist of Phantasy Star I, Alis Landale. It's had a number of its systems go offline, and you and your descendants work to repair it. But Phantasy Star III's real place in the universe's timeline only becomes apparent by visiting a skippable town in the game's third and final act.[CR]On the west side of Frigidia, one of the seven worlds, there is a town on an island accessible only by air, called New Mota. The people there are \"the keepers of our people's history\", they say (US release):[CR]We're the descendants of the people of Palm, a planet that once circled the distant star Algo. Palm was destroyed by an evil being that haunts us every 1,000 years, bringing death and ruin. This evil incarnate is known as Dark Force![CR]The people of Palm were thinkers and creators. They knew of the plans made by the evil being. When the vile Dark Force stirred 1,000 years ago, preparations were made to escape from Palm. Our ancestors built a fleet of 400 spaceships.[CR]This armada escaped the destruction of Palm and set off into space to find a new homeland. Our ancestors thought they had at last escaped from the clutches of the undying master of evil. But Dark Force managed to slip aboard a ship. It destroyed all but one of our sister ships before Orakio and Laya trapped it on Alisa III. Now there are only two ships left of our fleet: our ship, the Alisa III, and the Neo Palm.The names Orakio and Laya echo down through the years...[CR]Palm, Mota, and Dezo ( Palma, Motavia and Dezoris in the original Japanese) were the names of the three planets in the Algo ( Algol) system that were the settings for Phantasy Star I and II. The destruction of Palm happens during PS II.[CR]Other references: The \"word of power\" in the game is \" Nei\", the name of a critically important character in Phantasy Star II. The Nei Weapons are inherited from the characters of PS II, though it's never explained how.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Aron is the only one of Rhys' descendants to have his own unique walking sprite. The other descendants are just palette swaps of Lyle or Rhys' sprites.At the very start of the game, before you go an meet Maia at the marriage ceremony. You can sell your equipment at the shop and buy and escapipe. Once Maia gets kidnapped and Rhys gets imprisoned, you can use the escapipe to escape from the dungeon. Once doing this, the story is unable to progress and you can't leave town. The King says to you: \"You have used your escapipe! Normally a smart move, but now I'm afraid the game can't be continued. Please press RESET and try again.\" Which is exactly what you'll have to do.[CR]\t[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]A glitch in the game will allow you to make either Laya or Kara always act first in battle and be immune to physical attacks, as well as moderately improve the speed and defense of the rest of the party.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]The glitch is activated in Skyhaven, when changing the Legendary weapons into Nei weapons.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]1. Decide who you want to always act first and be immune to physical attacks - Laya or Kara.[CR]2. Remove all items from that person. [CR]3. Make sure everyone else has their appropriate Legendary weapon equipped (Orakio Sword, Miun Claw, Siren Shot, Laya Bow, Lune Slicer).[CR]4. Speak to the second from the left old man, who says \"Nei is the word of ultimate power\".[CR]5. Check your status screens. For the person who had no equipment, attack and defense should be in the 64,000 range, and speed in the 220 range. For the others, the attack, defense, and speed bonuses of the Legendary weapon they had equipped will be permenantly added to their base stats. (Unfortunately, none of the increases to the attack statistic have effect on damage dealt in battle). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]The only way the person with 64,000 defense will be hurt is from a Gnasher (who will do a whopping 4 damage) or from techniques (which are unaffected). She will always act first.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]There are 3 side effects which may appear alarming but are in fact harmless. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]1. Colours will be unusual - this will be corrected once you check your menu and leave Skyhaven[CR]2. Last person in line will be shifted out of place - this will be corrected once you leave Skyhaven, and the out-of-line person will not prevent you from moving[CR]3. Characters will be renamed - this is permanent but harmless.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]You can win a battle instantly if you have the following situation: 1. Surprise the enemy 2. A technique bearing character with fewer TP then what a spell costs (ie 4 TP for a res spell) Instead of fighting, choose the \"single player command\" option and have that character try and cast a technique they do not have enough TP for. You will get a message that states something like \"Not enough tech points\", then instantly emerge victorious. Very helpful for when weak and facing several enemies. This will not work unless you surprise the enemy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]An escapipe glitch allows players to skip over Nial's generation directly to playing Aron.  Aron will need to do some of Nial's quest, but it goes much faster and easier with Aron, thanks to his healing and access to the Aero Parts.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]1. As Rhys, before fighting the king of Cille, make sure Wren or Mieu has an escape pipe.[CR]2. After defeating the king, select Nial's route by marrying Lena. (Do not choose Maia as the glitch does not work for Ayn.)[CR]3. As soon as the cinema is over and you can move, go into your menu and use an escapipe.[CR]4. As Nial, you will warp back to Cille dungeon. Walk through it again (you will encounter only Chirpers). The king and Maia are waiting in the same place as for Rhys, defeat him once more (an easy task with full HP/TP and a stronger leader). [CR]5. Select Aron's route by marrying Alair. (Do not choose Laya because Adan will be unable to complete his quest.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]At this point you play as Aron.  The Sub Parts, Laya Pendant, Twins Ruby, and Mystery Star that Aron come with are \"fakes\" that do not work, so Aron will need to collect the real ones as Nial would have.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]6. Collect the Aero Parts as normal.[CR]7. Fly to the rebel hideout and pick up the Sub Parts.[CR]8. Go to Hazatak using the caves to Landen, Aquatica, then Aridia.[CR]9. Get Laya as normal.[CR]10. Go to Mystoke and get the Laya pendant.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]From this point on finish the game as normal.",

Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians, and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died. Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...[CR]Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine assignment...[CR]The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the \"techniques\" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before, leveling up and technique-learning is automatic.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Phantom[CR]Phantom 2040 is a side-scrolling action game released for the SNES and Sega Genesis. The game was developed by Hearst Entertainment and published by Viacom New Media. Phantom 2040 was released in 1995 in Japan, North America, and Europe. The game is based off of the television series of the same name (itself a spinoff of Lee Falk's classic comic series The Phantom), with a story that is similar to that of the television show's, but not directly taken from it. Phantom 2040 is an action game that takes place in the city of Metropia. The Super Nintendo version holds an average rating of 68% on Game Rankings, while there are no reviews registered for the Genesis version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Phantom 2040 shares similarities with games such as Super Metroid.[CR]The gameplay of Phantom 2040 is similar to many other 2D side-scrolling action games. It contains many aspects similar to such games as Super Metroid and Bionic Commando. However, Phantom 2040 does have entirely unique gameplay mechanics as well. Phantom 2040 differs one way in that upgrading weapons is completely optional (unlike in Super Metroid, where there are set weapons and upgrades). Phantom 2040 also contains choices akin to moral choices (although based more on which direction to go).[CR]Phantom 2040 also focuses heavily on exploration (a key factor in Super Metroid). The player does not have to go a set way, for a set distance as in some games, but rather has each level to explore either direction, locating the objective. Most areas contain secret upgrades or health boosting items. Some levels even have gates that must be remotely unlocked via a corresponding number (each door has a number). Unlike in Super Metroid, most of the exploration is optional, as it veers off of the game's main objective. Most of the areas can be revisited later for more exploration.[CR]The game takes place across seven chapters, some of which are split into varying paths (of which the player has a choice). Each chapter takes the player to a completely new location. Depending on what decisions the player makes in the stages that a decision is available, some stages might not become available while others do. This means that the game has very many endings (over twenty unique endings).

The world is in a catastrophic state, due to environmental disasters. The Earth's ecological state hangs in the balance. Growing population and the deployment of robots called BIOTS (Biological Optical Transputer Systems) have caused the majority of people to scavenge for food, while the lucky few live in large, towering mansions.[CR]New York City has been renamed Metropia, and is the world's largest and most powerful city. Metropia houses the world's most powerful organization: Maximum, inc.. In addition to being the producer of BIOTS, Maximum holds high political standing due to their bribery of many leaders. Due to this influence, Maximum has transformed Metropia into a technologically-advanced city devoid of any animal or plant life. The insane leader of Maximum, Rebecca Madison, is intent on building a fortress called Cyberville where the wealthy can reside, safe from everything.[CR]Kit Walker is a Phantom (the 24th Phantom, in fact). The Phantoms work to restore order to the world, bringing an end to corruption, greed, and the violence that plagues the world. Kit Walker must now defeat Rebecca Madison to stop her from getting her ultimate goal of world domination.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Chapter 7 with Golden Ending[CR]Enter this password on the Password screen to play from the final chapter, Golden Ending guaranteed.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Chapter 7 with Golden Ending[CR]Stage 2[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Chapter 7 with Golden Ending[CR]* * * * D T[CR]* * * * B T[CR]* * Y F * *[CR]Y G C T H D[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Chapter 7 with Golden Ending[CR]Stage 4[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Chapter 7 with Golden Ending[CR]* * * D ?

The game follows the Pink Panther's adventures across numerous film sets in Hollywood, trying to find fame and fortune while eluding the tenacious Inspector Clouseau.[CR]The game was released on both the SNES and Genesis in late 1993. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,7,7 and 7 out of ten. Danyon Carpenter wrote, \"I was surprised by how good this game actually was. Although the character may not be the most modern around, Pink Panther still offers fans of side-scrolling action games some new surprises and a lot of technique. The idea of having movie sets for stages was cool and the music that goes with it is fitting. I would like to have seen more power-ups available, but as it stands, the game is decent\".[CR]In the same issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly Mike Weigand reviewed the SNES version of the game giving it a 6 out of ten. He wrote, \"The cool pink cat makes it to the home systems! However, you may be better off with the Genesis version of this one, because the SNES counterpart suffers from stiff control and unappealing levels\".[CR]Curiously, as a part of the \"Major Mike's Game Roundup\" the review crew gave additional scores to the scores they had already given the Genesis version. Those scores are, 7,7,5 and 6 out of ten.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Press A and C on controller 1 and B on controller 2 immediately after you turn on your Genesis.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter is a fighting game released by Atari Games in 1990. Though it was widely reviled by critics for its lackluster game play and fighting style, it is notable and revolutionary for being the first fighting game to utilize blue screen-captured digitized versions of real people for use as the games characters. This would later be used by the Mortal Kombat series, among others, to greater effect.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato. These three fighters operated in a similar fashion gameplay-wise but had their own unique attacks and fighting styles to make up for this.CharacterDescriptionBuzzBuzz is an ex-pro wrestler, has a slow movement speed but makes up for this in his brutal available attacks which included a body slam, a headbutt, and a pile driver.TyTy is slightly faster than Buzz, though not to a great degree. He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.[CR]There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.[CR]These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO.[CR]Ports[CR]Though the arcade version of Pit-Fighter quickly became irrelevant due to the introduction of Mortal Kombat and other highly successful fighters, it was ported to many home consoles and portable devices, which included the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amistrad, SNES, Genesis, Atari Lynx, Sinclair Spectrum and Game Boy. These ports varied widely in quality, though all retained the basic characters and gameplay style that Pit-Fighter was known for.[CR]The arcade version of Pit-Fighter was also featured in a recent greatest hit compilation known as Midway Arcade Treasures 2, which was available on Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube, as well as a PC-only compilation named Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secert menu[CR] At the title screen press A + B + C for a secret options menu.",

In the Demo mode, the player can choose any Premier League team, but only for a season.[CR]In either of the modes, the player is responsible for carefully assembling the team (and unlike other managers, selecting the appropriate tactics is crucial to win the game), get the best from the transfer market by selling the fading stars and outselling the biggest clubs in England in the quest for the stars of the future, improve stadium capacity and quality (including seating, roof, security and others), sign good deals for ground advertising and balance the budget to make the team finish the season out of the red.[CR]Matches are always simulated, with a ruler showing where the ball is, and with text messages showing actions (like \"player passes\", player tackles\" and so on).

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Primal Rage is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994. Players control one of seven giant beasts (who are rendered in stop-motion animation) who must battle each other to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known in the game as \"Urth\"). Although not as popular as the also-violent Mortal Kombat franchise, the game spawned toys, comic books, and a novel, as well as many ports.[CR]A sequel (simply named Primal Rage II) was in development, but was canceled (though some early prototypes have been found).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.[CR] Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Fatalities (glorified execution moves that can only be performed at the end of the winner's winning round) are also performed in this way. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.[CR]During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground (giving back some of the player's health). Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.[CR]After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final battle to keep its place as \"king of the hill\". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish \"dinosaur graveyard\", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, he can immediately restore his initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues.[CR]Characters [CR] The character select screen with the seven playable characters.[CR]The game includes seven playable characters. (Six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) A final boss character was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped. Sauron and Diablo are palette swaps of each other, while Blizzard and Chaos are also palette swaps. (However, Diablo and Chaos are smaller than Sauron and Blizzard in terms of size) Sauron Talon Vertigo (not available in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) Blizzard Chaos Armadon Diablo[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Colors[CR]Please do the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Colors[CR]At the Option Screen enter the following code:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fergus Devil[CR]From the Start/Options screen, enter the More Options code to get a third choice (Extra Options). Enable the Okay Right? option from the Extra Options menu, then start a game. Choose Diablo as your fighter. A jumping devil with the Fergus face will appear during your matches.",

Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, \"Racoon\", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship \"Septemius 2\" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance. Will you be able to uncover the mystery?[CR]This is a Japanese adventure in anim style.

Certain objects in the game can be picked up and used in some way to help you complete the level. You can even stack objects, such as barrels to help you reach the higher platforms. You can also throw these objects at the enemies, or even pick up a gun and shoot them. Also, the object you carry will make you weigh more, so you wont be able to jump as high depending on your weight. Each object has a different weight to it, from a balloon that will help you float to a weight that will sink you quickly.[CR]The goal of each level is to reach the exit. Optionally, you may bring items with you through the exit door to give you more points. Often times levels will involve finding a key and unlocking a chest to reach the most valuable item to take back with you.

Then released for the Genesis just a year later. The game stars two of Marvel's comic book characters, The Punisher and       Nick Fury.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Similar to any other beat'em up, The Punisher makes use of a eight way joy-stick and two buttons, attack and jump. Once the game begins, the first player will atomically be assigned to Punisher, while the second player will play as Nick Fury.  The Punisher, using his gun as a means of defense.     The player will fight a variety of enemies with the use of the attack button. With a certain combination performed, the player can activate specials moves; some of them be link into a combo. For example, after the player unleashes two hits, the player must tap forward twice to perform a straight jab punch that performs a couple hits on every enemy that's in the way of the range of impact before knocking them all down. A character also has a special that can knock down every enemy that's perform by pressing both the attack and jump button simultaneously, like other beat'em ups like  Final Fight. When a enemy with a firearm or a robot named, \"Pretty Boy\" is brought in, the player's character will immediately pull out a gun and can fire at enemies with infinite ammo. Once those certain enemies have been defeated, the gun will no longer be in use until another robotic/weapon carrying enemy appears. Optional weapons are at the player's disposal. Weapons such as steel pipes, M-16, dynamite, combat knives, flamethrowers, etc can be use. The player can only use the weapons a certain amount times as indicated on the bottom of the screen. At one point in the game, a bonus stage will take place. The objective of the stage is the player must move a target on screen and fire at moving barrels before they roll off screen. The player will earn points for each barrel destroyed.[CR]The Genesis Version[CR]  The Genesis version.     Just a year after the arcade release, Capcom develop The Punisher for the              Sega Genesis in 1994 for the             North American market, then in            Europe in 1995. As with the limitations with the Genesis hardware, all of the destructible environment were removed. Like Final Fight on the           Super Nintendo, The Punisher went through some censorship. The blood splattering that occurs when stabbing an enemy with a knife was taken out. And at the end of the first boss fight, which takes place on a moving bus, Punisher shoots the first boss in the head, that was replace with Punisher just throwing him off the bus.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo is an arcade puzzle game featuring characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG franchise. It is often referred to as first game of the Puyo Puyo series, despite the fact that an earlier Puyo Puyo title exists. The game was developed by Compile and published by Sega on their Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware. As opposed to its predecessor, the arcade Puyo Puyo places a heavy emphasis on competitive play; the game's single player mode consist of a 13-match gauntlet against various Madou Monogatari enemies, while the multiplayer mode pits two players against each other in a 2-out-of-3 Puyo match.[CR]The arcade version was ported to a variety of platforms. Three of these home ports would be extensively modified for worldwide release: the Genesis and Game Gear ports became Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while the SNES port (Super Puyo Puyo) became Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player fighting Draco[CR]Puyo Puyo is a puzzle game with two players, although one may be controlled by the computer. Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they \"pop\" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are \"connected\" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.[CR]When the player successfully pops pieces, they send \"garbage\" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.[CR]The player that hits the top of the well loses.Game Modes[CR]Puyo Puyo is split into two modes:Single Puyo Puyo[CR]In the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of Arle Nadja, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: \"Beginner\" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, \"Normal\" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. Draco Centauros), while \"Difficult\" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. Harpy). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.Double Puyo Puyo[CR]This is basically multiplayer mode. In it two players play against each other. By out-chaining the other player, the player fills out his grid and that leads to victory.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ProtagonistsArle Nadja: The protagonist. She sets it as her goal to defeat Satan, after he tries to steal her beloved pet Carbuncle, which she loves more than anything. She is a sorceress that can cast Ice, Lightning and Fire.Carbuncle: Arle's beloved pet, the one Satan attempts to steal.Beginner OpponentsSkeleton T: A skeleton that loves drinking herbal tea.Nasu Grave: An eggplant that wears square glasses. He jumps up and down most of the time, as he is too slow to runMummy: An Egyptian mummy who walks around wrapped in bandagesNormal / Difficult OpponentsDraco Centauros: A half-human, half-dragon girl who can manipulate fire.Suketoudara: A fish with muscular human arms and legs.Sukiyapodes: A one-legged, baby-faced monster.Harpy: An angel-like girl that sings out-of-tune, high-pitched songs.Sasoriman: A guard disguised as a scorpion.Panotty: A flute-playing sprite who becomes enraged when Arle doesn't dance to his song.Zombie: A zombie put together by spare parts.Witch: A witch who is prone to random giggles.Zoh Daimaoh: A raging Indian elephant whose Puyo causes the screen to shake.Schezo Wegey: A dark wizard whose desire for Arle's power is comically misconstrued.Minotauros: A minotaur who serves Rulue.Rulue: A female martial artist who is madly in love with Satan. As she was not faced in combat in the original versions of Madou Monogatari, she does not have a voice clip to introduce herself with.Satan: The final boss; a horned demon man who wants to be Arle's fiance.[CR]English Localizations[CR]\"Silvana\" vs. \"Goby Captain\" in the English version of unknown origin.[CR]An English-translated version of the arcade release was released in Europe, but the authenticity of this version is disputed; it is not known whether the game was officially localized by Compile/Sega or if it is an unlicensed bootleg. In addition to adding English voice work (and removing the wings from Harpy's sprites), this version changes almost all of the character names. One specific name change, Satan to \"Dark Prince,\" is also used in the English versions of the Neo Geo Pocket Color Puyo Pop and GBA Puyo Pop.[CR]Though the Game Gear port was not released outside of Japan, playing the game in a non-Japanese system will reveal an English version named \"Puzlow Kids.\" Notably, the ending text of Puzlow Kids's scenario mode is identical to the script of the English arcade release; this includes a mention of \"the Dark Prince.\" However, Puyo were renamed to \"P-Kids\" in this version, while they are known as \"PuyoPuyo\" in the English arcade game.[CR]Sega and Nintendo published their own localized versions of Puyo Puyo, though they both stripped the Madou Madogatari characters from the game and used their well-known franchises instead. Sega used characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon to create Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while Nintendo and HAL Laboratory used Kirby characters to make Kirby's Avalanche. Mean Bean Machine drops the difficulty level system (and the beginner characters with it), but includes a password feature; the game also reuses several Puyo Puyo BGM tracks, such as Satan's theme becoming the Verses Mode and Danger themes. Kirby's Avalanche does not make any gameplay changes but replaces every song except the Danger theme with Kirby-series BGM.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test (Alternate Method)[CR]On the title screen, press A, A, Left, B, B, Left, C, and C. You will hear a sound when the code is entered correctly. Sound Test is located on the Options menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]To unlock the Sound Test, complete the game on any difficulty.

Like Bonanza Bros., the game is designed for two players to compete with one another, though it can be played single-player as well.[CR]The goal of Tant-R is to chase after escaped convicts by solving mini-games. These mini-games are selected at random, though the player can stop on the desired mini-game with a roulette function similarly to how mini-games are decided in the Mario Party series. Some of these roulette options instead provide bonuses (such as additional lives) and lead to a random game. Most of these mini-games involve solving common puzzles such as sliding blocks around to form a picture or solving shell games involving ninjas and top hats.[CR]The game was released in the Arcades initially in 1992, and then ported to the Mega Drive and Game Gear in Japan only. It was followed with two sequels: 1994's Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R, also for the Arcade, Mega Drive and Game Gear; and 1997's Puzzle & Action: Treasure Hunt, for the Arcade and Saturn.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must complete several mini-games, chosen from a roulette of four at a time, in order to re-capture the game's antagonist. At the end, they must then solve one unique boss mini-game to complete the capture. The single-player mode is split up into four chapters: each chapter adds an extra four games to the required total to win, as well as making all the mini-games harder, either by speeding them up, making them more complex or reducing the timer (or a combination thereof).[CR]The featured mini-games include:Robot Factory: The player must assemble the robot shown in the picture, choosing from an array of body parts. The finished robot requires a head, a body, two arms and two legs.Photoshock: The goal of this game is to take a picture just as a fast-moving subject enters the frame in the middle of the screen. A simple timing mini-game that requires the player be precise.Which Digit Is It?: The player is shown a four digit code but only one number at a time, which is rapidly changing. The player must select the right four digit code from a list based on what they can see.Pathmaker Flip-Flop Frog: The player must guide a frog around a pond, stopping on every available square without repeating or doubling-back. The player can reverse a mistake, but has a strict time limit.Pay Hattention to the Flower: A variant of the classic shell game. The player must keep track of a rose under one of four top hats as they quickly switch positions.Zig-Zag Labyrinth: The player must find the right course through a maze. The angled top-down view makes the maze visually confusing.Certain Death! Unstopwatchable: The player must simply pause a stopwatch between the times indicated. They usually have less than a decisecond margin of error.A Change of Art: The player must unscramble a picture. Each picture is much longer than tall, and some images are harder to assemble than others (such as a pile of identical coins).Stanley How-Many-Cubericks?: The player is shown an isometric pile of blocks and must determine how many are in the picture. They must count those concealed by blocks lying on top. The title refers to legendary film director Stanley Kubrick.Cock-A-Doodle Do Your Worst: A button-mashing game that requires the player pump up balloons until they burst, scaring a nearby rooster.Make It a Slot Boogie: The player must find a series of five symbols in a large grid. This series can be horizontal or vertical, but must be in a row. The symbols are all icons usually found on slot machines (bar, cherry, seven, etc.).Billy Jewel: The player must shift gems around a four-by-four grid to ensure all the gems of a certain color are in the right position. The title refers to singer Billy Joel.Block n' Roll: Using the equation provided, the player must determine the correct shape from a grid of options.Where's the Ninja?: A pair of ninjas rapidly flash around the screen before vanishing. The player must select the location where the golden ninja was last seen.Animal Sound Shower: A variant on the classic puzzle game Simon. The player must recreate a series of animal noises by tapping on the correct animal heads, using only their memory.Three-Hint Panel Pick: The player is given a grid of shapes and colors and is given three hints as to the right panel. These include directional hints (\"under a circle\") as well as information on the shape/color of the desired panel.Boss Showdown!: The final mini-game, played exactly once at the end of the single-player mode. The boss has hidden himself somewhere, and the player is given a set of coordinates. They must quickly find the location on a large map filled with possibilities.[CR]",

The jug is fragile: if it is kicked or dropped any distance, it will break and the stage must be restarted. However, it is also dangerous: much like the stone blocks, if the explorer falls even one square while carrying it, he will be crushed by its weight. In each puzzle, the player must collect all of the keys to open the door, but he must also reach the door while carrying the jug with him in order to proceed.

Played from a top-down perspective in-level, with over-the-shoulder perspective boss fights between levels, Rambo uses his AK-47, blocks of C-4, explosive tipped arrows and, of course, his enormous K-BAR knife to fight his way in and out of the 6 levels in the game.[CR]The game also had Rambo accomplishing a variety of mission objectives, including rescuing prisoners, taking out Soviet supplies, and shooting down HIND helicopters with explosive arrows. Some game mechanics included item refills though the use of the combat knife - enemies dispatched with the knife usually leave behind items. This exposed Rambo to additional danger however, since the game employed a one-hit-wonder health system, forcing the player to weigh the risks and rewards of going after those items.[CR]SMS Version[CR]The Sega Master System version of Rambo III is a light-gun game, rather than the top-down shooter found on other systems. Though more similar mechanically to the \"behind-the-shoulder\" TPS Arcade version, very little of the game appears to have anything to do with the plot of Rambo III, as the generic enemies look nothing like Soviet soldiers. It's possible the game was at one point a generic light gun game and had the Rambo III license bolted onto it late during its development.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Limited Invincibility[CR]In Mission 2, go to the destructable box up and to the far left from the starting point.  Proceed to the left until a little shiny bit of the box is showing.  Destroy the box with an arrow, making sure there's no enemy soldiers on the screen.  As soon as there's an impact, walk left as far as you can with a trail of smoke behind you.

Played from a top-down perspective in-level, with over-the-shoulder perspective boss fights between levels, Rambo uses his AK-47, blocks of C-4, explosive tipped arrows and, of course, his enormous K-BAR knife to fight his way in and out of the 6 levels in the game.[CR]The game also had Rambo accomplishing a variety of mission objectives, including rescuing prisoners, taking out Soviet supplies, and shooting down HIND helicopters with explosive arrows. Some game mechanics included item refills though the use of the combat knife - enemies dispatched with the knife usually leave behind items. This exposed Rambo to additional danger however, since the game employed a one-hit-wonder health system, forcing the player to weigh the risks and rewards of going after those items.[CR]SMS Version[CR]The Sega Master System version of Rambo III is a light-gun game, rather than the top-down shooter found on other systems. Though more similar mechanically to the \"behind-the-shoulder\" TPS Arcade version, very little of the game appears to have anything to do with the plot of Rambo III, as the generic enemies look nothing like Soviet soldiers. It's possible the game was at one point a generic light gun game and had the Rambo III license bolted onto it late during its development.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Limited Invincibility[CR]In Mission 2, go to the destructable box up and to the far left from the starting point.  Proceed to the left until a little shiny bit of the box is showing.  Destroy the box with an arrow, making sure there's no enemy soldiers on the screen.  As soon as there's an impact, walk left as far as you can with a trail of smoke behind you.  You will be invincible until you reach a bonus stage where you can be killed, or until you destroy another box.",

Created by Atari for the Arcades, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.[CR]The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.[CR]In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ranger X uses his Flamethrower[CR]The Homeworld has been invaded and overrun by powerful cyber terrorists. They have unleashed cybernetic warriors across the land and started building infrastructure and giant weapons installations to continue their campaign of subjugation.[CR]You are Ranger X, a powerful mech with unique abilities. Alone you will fight against the cybernetic hordes to bring peace and justice to the world. Along the way your will find more powerful weapons to bring death to your enemies and remove the threat once and for all.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ranger X takes place over several levels with each level having basically the same structure: there are several smaller targets that must be taken out before you can confront the boss at the end of the level. The smaller objectives are generally things like power convertors or weapons enplacements (though in level 5 they are giant sentry robots) that serve some strategic purpose in the overall war against the terrorists. The objectives appear on a radar display on screen so it is easy to find them, though the linear nature of most levels means that they are generally quite obvious. Once all the objectives are clear and you reach the end of the level there is always a large, screen filling boss that can be somewhat challenging.Secondary Weapons[CR]Along with the basic laser beam Ranger X has access to several secondary weapons. These range from a flamethrower to a hawk that will attack enemies to a large, screen clearing positron beam. Secondary weapons are fired based on a separate energy meter that will recharge slowly while you are in sunlight; however, in level 2 you need to open holes in the cave to emit light and in level 5 you need to stand in the spotlights. Secondary Weapons will fire in whatever direction Ranger X is facing and typically do a lot more damage than your primary weapon.Ex-UpsEx-Up Eos[CR]In every level you are accompanied by one of two vehicles, called Ex-Ups, that will provide you with firepower and transport. By pressing down on the d-pad you can combine with the ex-up which provides both shelter and allows you to change your secondary weapon. Only one Ex-Up will be available in each level.Ex-Up Indra: The Indra is basically a motor bike that will follow Ranger X through the levels. You can stand on top of it to increase your speed or combine with it to access it's homing laser and use it for protection, however it has it's own life bar. If the the Indra explodes while you are in it you will die; it is invulnerable while you are outside of it.Ex-Up Eos: The Eos is a floating weapon platform that will occasionally fire a laser beam which can only really destroy the weaker enemies in the game. Other than being needed to switch your secondary weapon the Eos is much less useful than the Indra.[CR]Control[CR]The controls are fairly simple, yet it is strongly recommended that the game is played with a 6-button controller. The A and C buttons fire left and right, respectively, and the B button is used to fire the secondary weapon. On a 6-button controller X and Z are used to control the Indra while you are not combined with it. This is especially useful since the Indra will fire its main weapon when Ranger X fires his, so you can attack two different enemies at once if using a 6-button controller.[CR]Ranger X is also capable of flight; your boosters are activated by pressing up on the d-pad. As you use more booster your heat meter will increase. If it hits the top your boosters will cut out and only be available once you land. This is especially annoying in level 4, since this level involves flying up the side of a very tall building and killing enemies on ledges and in windows. On the easier difficulty settings there are floating platforms that will allow you to refresh your boosters; on the hard difficulty you have to climb the entire building without overheating or else you have to start all the way from the beginning.[CR]Graphics[CR]A far off city burns[CR]Ranger X pushed the limits of the Genesis' color palette. Most levels are very colorfl and attempt to create depth to the levels by using perspective tricks or movement in the background to imply three dimensions. For example, in the first level the target is to destroy laster canons that are bombarding a nearby city. In the background you can see the city being hit by laser blasts which appear to travel a great distance.[CR]Every level also begins with a flyby of the terrain and a description of the targets. This is done using vector graphics, and while rough, it was a fairly impressive feat considering the technology of the time.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Ranger-X the scores of 8,9,7 and 7. Danyon Carpenter awarded the highest score writing, \"...it puts the many other action titles like it to shame -- and then some! The difficulty is high, but it's welcome in this day of way-too-easy games! The colors are simply brilliant, as well. The control can seem a little quirky at first however. The incredible variety of weapons, the non-stop action, and doses of strategy are pretty much unequaled by anything else\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Pause game play and press Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, C, B, A, Right, Left.

                "plot": "Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator.  Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.[CR]The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series.  Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.[CR]Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  Each of the three characters have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot missions.[CR]Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the Strike series of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has a straight-down POV that rotates along with the helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx's earlier and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the manipulation of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual effects not seen in other games, such as simulated video.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Mission Passwords + Invincibility[CR]These are the mission passwords with invincibility already (you do not need to input the invincibility code beforehand).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Mission Passwords[CR]This can be two players if you so desire.",

Its final prototype was released on May 23rd, 1994, followed by the official release the following month on June 16th.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In a dystopian future, the corporations have taken over. The New Order Nation (NON), lead by the villainous Mistress Helga, have waged war on the youth and have banned music, television, and video games. But the greatest injustice is that they have kidnapped Aerosmith! The player must defeat the NON with the power of music. Which means firing CDs at guys in yellow suits and motorcycle helmets, and giant glowing green skulls![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is a standard rail shooter in which the player is led along a set path and must defeat enemies by aiming and shooting at them with the yellow button. The home versions were not light gun-compatible.[CR]Each stage has hidden rooms containing a member of Aerosmith. Rescuing all members of Aerosmith and collecting Aerosmith's winged logo after each rescue will unlock the game's best ending, consisting of a party with the band and a bonus room filled with loot and smoking hot babes.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The members of the band are hidden within the levels and if they are all found the player gets the proper canon ending.The songs Eat the Rich, Toys in the Attic, Sweet Emotion, and Walk this Way are looped throughout the game. Not the entire song, but rather a few seconds of each, over and over and over again.There were plans to make a Public Enemy version, but that game never came to fruition.The CD-ROM releases of Revolution X featured full-motion video sequences with members of the band informing the game's plot.Following a particularly large explosion, Steven Tyler will occasionally yell \"Toasty!\", an homage to Dan Forden's uppercut reward in Mortal Kombat II, which had an advertisement for Revolution X in its attract mode.[CR]",

The world is filled with NPCs (Non-Player Character) that the player must talk to, and get clues from. Just as in The Legend Of Zelda, most of the world is accessible from the start leaving the player free to explore, and discover, the world at their own will. [CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rings of Power was the second game created by developer Naughty Dog (Keef the Thief being first) and was published by Electronic Arts. In the game the player assumes the role of a young Sorcerer named Buc, who is tasked with gathering the eleven Rings Of Power to recreate the Rod of Creation, and defeat the evil god Void once and for all.[CR]The Rod Of Creation was broken in to two after a deadly battle between the holy god Nexus and Void. After the battle each god took a half of the Rod of Creation and created eleven rings, which were given to trusted members from each of the six guilds. Over time the Rings of Power were lost and the story became a legend, however the story was real, and news comes that Void is attempting to command a group of followers to recover the Rings of Power.[CR]The game begins at the Sorcerers Guild, where a traitor is revealed and attacks Buc's Sorcerer master Thalamus. To protect the students Thalamus casts them from the Guild and scatters them across the globe. Thalamus instructs Buc to gather a party of members from the other guilds, and find the Rings of Power before Void does. As Buc you must seek out and team up with the Knight Slash from the City of Division, the Necromancer Mortimer from the City of Blood, the Archer Feather from the City of Speed, the Conjurer Alexi from the City of Perfection, and the Enchanter Obliky from the City of Kaos.[CR]Together, you must gather each of the eleven Rings of Power and unite them before Void does to finally destroy him forever. [CR]The Rings of Power[CR]The eleven Rings of Power are as follows:The Ring of AdvancingThe Ring of BileThe Ring of BloodThe Ring of CallingThe Ring of DivisionThe Ring of IntuitionThe Ring of MutationThe Ring of PerfectionThe Ring of ThoughtThe Ring of VariationThe Ring of Will [CR]Nude Code[CR]Rings of Power is considered to be the first game to feature a nude code. The game opens with a Naughty Dog title sequence, in which a blonde woman in a t-shirt appears on the screen. The screen then pans to the right revealing the Naughty Dog character and the company logo. By holding down the buttons A, B, C and START, while also pressing the D-Pad DOWN RIGHT on a second controller as you turn on the Genesis, you will initiate the nude sequence. The same Naughty Dog title sequence appears, but the blonde woman will appear topless next to the Naughty Dog logo.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] New Logo (Mature Audiences Only)[CR]To get an alternate Naughty Dog Games logo during the opening splash sequence, before you turn on you Genesis hold down A + B + C + Down-Right + Start, then turn your power on.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Refill any Chest.[CR]To Refill any chest you have opened, simply look at your map.  When you close the map, any chests you have opened will be closed and will have a random item inside.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]At the time of the game's release, people were very impressed by the advanced 3D visuals.Rise of the Robots is a fighting game developed by Mirage Technologies and released on a wide variety of platforms including the SNES and Sega Master System. The game was even released in an arcade cabinet.All of the featured characters are robots, with the exception of the main player character featured on the front cover, who is in fact a cyborg; whenever he is defeated in battle, a brief cutscene is shown of his lifeless body, and as the armour around his face is destroyed, we see a human eye underneath. This style was influenced by several popular movies at the time like Blade Runner and The Terminator.The game had a lot of hype pre-release due to the highly detailed visuals and soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). It was intended to take the gameplay of similar fighting games like Street Fighter II, and mesh it with highly advanced visuals to create a new, more technologically advanced era of fighting games. However, upon release the game failed to live up to expectations; the graphics, visuals, and soundtrack were all well made, but the controls handled terribly and movement felt sluggish. The game was almost universally panned by critics and quickly became known for it's poor controls, repetitive gameplay, and lack of any real substance. Some critics went so far as to claim that the reason the gameplay was so bad, was because so much development time had been spent on making the visuals as advanced as possible, and that the reason the movement and fighting felt so sluggish was because the graphics had to use so much memory and so many frames to even convey something as simple as a straight punch. Aside from the usual commands of punches and kicks, there were only a maximum of two special moves per character, and no real combos to speak of, leading to most battles involving players resorting to using constant flying kicks against their opponent in order to take them down, a strategy seen in much older games like Yie Ar Kung Fu. In addition one of the chief complaints was that players only had one character to chose from in single player mode (Cotton) and that even in multiplayer mode one player always had to play as Cotton.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the year 2043, in the land of Metropolis 4. An extremely large company called Electrocorp has a large amount of control over the world thanks to their technological breakthroughs in the fields of science and medicine, they have amassed a fortune greater than that of any other company or country, and have power over all the energy distribution across the planet. In this world, robots are humans servants and perform virtually every task imaginable, leaving humans to focus on developing more important technology and try to make new scientific breakthroughs. Electrocorp, as the world's leading producer and distributor of robots, has been put under great pressure due to the high demand of the increasing global population and so decide to create a supremely advanced AI which will be able to manage the company effectively and cope with the demand of the people. Thus, the Leader Project is established at the Metropolis 4 sector of the Electrocorp company. The project culminates with the creation of The Supervisor, an incredibly intelligent robot, more advanced than anything Electrocorp has ever built before, with the capacity to learn at an incredibly fast rate, along with being able to absorb knowledge from computer terminals in a matter of seconds, The Supervisor quickly exceeds all expectations of the scientists at Metropolis 4, and seems to have become the perfect robot, easily able to cope with the high levels of demand faced by the company, along with developing new ways to increase productivity and efficiency within Electrocorp. The Supervisor is granted power to control every single robot on the planet whenever it needs to.However, things do not continue to go according to plan, while running general diagnostic checks on The Supervisor at Metropolis 4, the scientists discover some new mysterious lines of data in their results and quickly learn that The Supervisor has been infected with the most advanced computer virus ever seen, the EGO virus. Normally this virus would simply destroy a computer or robot, but the effects seen on The Supervisor are completely unexpected. The Supervisor becomes self-aware, it begins to question why it has been made and why it should continue to do as it has been programmed, The Supervisor then takes on a humanoid female form as it decides to create a gender-specific identity for itself. As the virus continues to disrupt the programming put in place by Electrocorp, The Supervisor decides to disobey all orders from the company and take control of every robot on the planet, transmitting the virus to them electronically and ordering them all to rebel against their human masters, initiating a global cybernetic mutiny. The robots begin to destroy everything around them and chaos spreads across the globe, meanwhile, some scientists and officials trapped inside the plant at Metropolis 4 try to come up with a plan to destroy The Supervisor, there is no way for any of them to access her as she is guarded by an army of destructive robots, and so they decide to contact the cyborg ECO35-2, known affectionately as Coton, a half-robot, half-human creation who has not been affected by the EGO virus thanks to his organic brain, the scientists inform Coton that he is the world's only hope for survival and he must battle his way through Metropolis 4 to The Supervisor and eliminate her. Thus the battle begins, with Coton having to take on all of The Supervisor's powerful robot minions, before eventually reaching her and defeating her humanoid form in combat, thus restoring order to the planet and saving all of it's surviving inhabitants.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ECO35-2 (Coton) - The protagonist of the story and only playable character in the single-player campaign, Coton is a cyborg with a human mind and organs, developed in secret by Electrocorp with a budget equivalent to that of the Leader Project. Despite his enemies often carrying and utilising weapons of some kind, Coton fights using only his fists, he has a thick armour plating covering his humanoid body from head to toe, and has been genetically engineered to be as fast and simultaneously powerful as possible. As stated, he has a human central nervous system and brain, no electrical components have been inserted into his body and so the EGO virus had no effect on him, allowing him to retain autonomy and take orders from the Electrocorp scientists to go after The Supervisor. All of his human organs were cloned from the CEO of Electrocorp, who in turn raised Coton as his own son, thus, when the CEO was slaughtered by rebellious robots in the beginning's of the robot mutiny of Metropolis 4, Coton wanted revenge for the murder of what he believed to be his father, thus giving him extra incentive and motive to pursue The Supervisor and destroy her.His special attacks are as follows:Turbo Head Butt - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Charge - A short range barge attack, useful for getting out of corners.Loader - This is the first of six enemies Coton encounters in his quest to destroy The Supervisor. The loader, as its name suggests, was originally simply a loading droid working in the warehouses of Metropolis 4, its primary duty being to lift and carry heavy objects and load them onto trucks to be dispatched elsewhere. When it became infected with the EGO virus however, this loader became a destructive and lethal force, despite being slow-moving and ill-suited for combat, the loader has powerful attacks thanks to its heavy forked arms. As this is the first enemy in the game, it is slow moving and has poor AI, and can easily be defeated with Coton's superior speed and jumping abilities.The special attack of the Loader:Fork Slash - A mighty horizontal blow in which the Loader swings its fork arms at its opponent, slicing anything that gets in the way.Builder - The second enemy encountered in the game, the builder has the appearance of a large blue robotic gorilla, and acts in a similar fashion, using its superior upper body strength to move along on its knuckles whilst defending its relatively small and weak legs. This enemy is also slow-moving and focuses mainly on defense, forcing Coton to gradually wear it down with a rapid succession of attacks.The special attacks of the Builder:Pile Driver - This is a grab move wherein the Builder picks up Coton, spinning him upside down before slamming him down into the ground.Bomber Jump - With this move, the Builder demonstrates its surprising acrobatic abilities by leaping high into the air and slamming down to the ground, releasing a destructive shockwave upon impact.Crusher - The first relatively fast enemy encountered in the game, the Crusher has an insect like appearance, light thin legs allow for much more rapid movement than either the Loader or the Builder, and its sharp snapping pincers have the potential to do a great deal of damage should anything be caught within their grasp.The special attack of the Crusher:Pincer-Mincer - In this attack the Crusher extends its long arms, if it manages to connect with its opponent, the pincers will slowly crush the life out of them.Military - The first enemy encountered by Coton that has true fighting experience and was genuinely designed for combat, the Military droid appears humanoid in shape, can move almost as fast as Coton, and has powerful punches and kicks. This enemy has a high level of defense and is programmed to be able to quickly adapt to any combat situation, meaning that the AI for this enemy is more advanced than those that preceded it.Special attacks of the Military droid:Catapult Spin - For this attack the Military droid extends its arms and spins towards its opponent, should Coton come into contact with the spinning arms he will incur a great amount of damage.Cyber Slash - Here the Military droid reveals a hidden weapon, an extendable sword protrudes from its arm which it then uses to slash at anything in its path.Sentry - Another droid built for combat. The Sentry is a red, demonic looking robot, much stronger than the Military droid, and standing at 3.5 metres tall, the Sentry poses an intimidating challenge for Coton. The jets on its back allow it to fly for brief periods of time, and there are several in-built weapons upon the Sentry, none of which are actually utilised in game.Special attack of the Sentry:Flying Jet Kick - Here the Sentry makes use of its jetpacks to fly towards its opponent at rapid speed, delivering a destructive kick.The Supervisor - The final enemy in the game and by far the most advanced. The Supervisor appears in a humanoid female form, possessing both incredible speed and power to rival that of Coton, along with the most advanced artificial intelligence known to man, The Supervisor is certainly Coton's most difficult opponent.[CR]Sequel[CR]A sequel to the game, entitled Resurrection: Rise 2, was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC in 1996. It featured several of the characters from the first game, continuing the story of Coton, and once again included music written and performed by Brian May.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Supervisor in two player mode[CR]Go into the options menu and press Up, up, down, down, left, left, right, right, A, B, C, A, B, C.

The game has also been featured in numerous Sega game compilations, including  Sonic Mega Collection,  Sonic Mega Collection Plus,  Sega Genesis Collection, and  Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. The game stars the eponymous  Ristar, who must travel the galaxy and rescue his father while stopping Greedy, an evil alien tyrant who has enslaved the population and brainwashed the planet's leaders. The game was composed by  Tomoko Sasaki, who would continue to work with Sonic Team in the future.[CR]Ristar was created from early concept designs of the original  Sonic the Hedgehog. The idea of Ristar's extending arms was taken from a rabbit that would use its ears to grab enemies.  The rabbit was originally known as Feels.  Feels the Rabbit, in concept, was alleged to be the mascot for SEGA to go against Mario and Nintendo in a marketing fashion.  Allegedly, higher ranking officials at SEGA did not think that Feels was cutting edge and fast enough to compete.  The ideas behind Feels and his stretchy ears, which would eventually become Ristar's trademark stretchy arms, were put on the back burner for what would become Sonic.  Feels eventually continued development, in which he was changed to a star by the name of Dexstar.  Dexstar would change names a few times until the name of Ristar was finally settled upon after development.  Ristar would eventually be released on February 15, 1995 in Europe, February 16, 1995 in the US, and February 17, 1995 in Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ristar's unique gameplay revolves around the use of the character's long, extending arms. Unlike other platformers, the player cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them, so the player must grab enemies and crash into them. The player must also use these arms to interact with the environment, such as climbing ladders, swinging from poles or knocking over trees. The player can also use his arms to reach areas directly above or below him. Like other platformers, the mechanics get increasingly difficult and the player must master the use of Ristar's arms if they are to complete the game. Another unique device in Ristar are cranks. Located throughout the stages, they can be grabbed, which spins Ristar until the player lets go. Using timing, the player can fly off in their desired direction to reach platforms, or to crash into enemies.[CR]The player's health is indicated by stars, which can be replenished throughout the level, located in chests. Yellow stars grant one point of health, while blue stars restore all health. Players can restore extra lives through pickups in the form of Ristar statues, or by gaining 20,000 points. Points are gained by defeating enemies, or through collectible gems.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in the Game Gear version is mostly identical, but features additional levels as well as a number of changes to original ones. Also included are stars that are scattered throughout the levels, which grant the player an extra life upon collecting 100, much like  coins in  Super Mario.[CR]The game is split up into 7 worlds, each two stages in length, as well as a final boss-only world. The first stage contains a mini-boss, while the second stage contains a main boss. Each stage also contains a bonus stage, which involve reaching a chest in a certain amount of time. If the player reaches the chest in less than a minute, they earn an extra life. If the player completes enough bonus levels, they will be awarded with  passwords upon completion of the game.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]Planet Flora: The typical Sonic Team first world: A vegetated forest which introduces the game's mechanics.Planet Undertow: A dry desert, containing the game's underwater levels.Planet Scorch: An industrial planet with volcanoes.

The game has also been featured in numerous Sega game compilations, including  Sonic Mega Collection,  Sonic Mega Collection Plus,  Sega Genesis Collection, and  Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. The game stars the eponymous  Ristar, who must travel the galaxy and rescue his father while stopping Greedy, an evil alien tyrant who has enslaved the population and brainwashed the planet's leaders. The game was composed by  Tomoko Sasaki, who would continue to work with Sonic Team in the future.[CR]Ristar was created from early concept designs of the original  Sonic the Hedgehog. The idea of Ristar's extending arms was taken from a rabbit that would use its ears to grab enemies.  The rabbit was originally known as Feels.  Feels the Rabbit, in concept, was alleged to be the mascot for SEGA to go against Mario and Nintendo in a marketing fashion.  Allegedly, higher ranking officials at SEGA did not think that Feels was cutting edge and fast enough to compete.  The ideas behind Feels and his stretchy ears, which would eventually become Ristar's trademark stretchy arms, were put on the back burner for what would become Sonic.  Feels eventually continued development, in which he was changed to a star by the name of Dexstar.  Dexstar would change names a few times until the name of Ristar was finally settled upon after development.

Can he rise to the occasion?[CR]Ristar being one of Sega's later releases for the Genesis, it didn't quite get enough recognition. But also being one of the later creations, it came out just wonderful. The graphics are nicely sized and everything in the game is vibrant and colorful, not to mention detailed.[CR]The music tracks are fitting, being very upbeat and cheerful to match the mood. Game-play is wonderful, too, Ristar being your side-scroller with a few little twists as well. If you're curious, give this game a go. You won't be disappointed.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Yep, more classic side-scrolling action packed in Ristar! Unlike Sonic, though, you'll have to rely on technique and patience to be able to venture through the vast worlds in this game. There are many treasures to be found, so make sure you find everything![CR]This game is separated into six different worlds you have to venture in: Flora, Undertow, Scorch, Sonata, Freon, and Automaton.[CR]The final area is a sort of spaceship level. During the first six areas, you'll encounter mini bosses who you'll have to fight.[CR]Ristar has a different way of fighting and getting around. Using his super long arms, he's able to latch onto enemies and strike or latch onto a branch and pull himself up or climb up walls. There are also aquatic levels, in which Ristar swims, but he's good in that environment also.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Jump[CR]B Button: Hold to grab, release to attack enemies[CR]C Button: Jump[CR]Start Button: Pause game[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Code List -[CR]AGES - Copyright info is shown.[CR]DOFEEL - Play bonus stage timed mode.[CR]ILOVEU - Level select function.[CR]MAGURO - \"Onchi Music\" mode enabled, two new tunes.[CR]MIEMIE - Hit blue stars to receive a treasure.[CR]MUSEUM - \"Boss Rush\" mode enabled.

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.[CR]By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.[CR]Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Various & Final Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:",

                "plot": "The Rash is back in the latest, nastiest, baddest race game for your Genesis. This time there's five NEW weapons, including the cattle-prod and crow bar. NEW race tracks take you across the globe, from the Aussie Outback to nighttime urban Japan. NEW modes raise the ante with the other Rashers while the NEW digitized graphics and interactive obstacles charge NEW life into the gameplay![CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Race against others on motorcycles. Punch, kick, and hit others with a weapon to push you closer to first place. The higher your rank, the better the pay you get! Avoid crashing into cars, and watch out for cops, or you will get busted![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?[CR]Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new digitized sprites (based on the 32-bit remake released an year earlier), bike upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more active and a longer race.[CR]As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars, which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.[CR]Each track has it's own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during the night under the neon lights.[CR]Controls:  [CR]A Button: Brake[CR]B Button: Accelerate[CR]C Button: punch/kicks if holding c and down/uses weapon[CR]X Button: N/A[CR]Y Button: N/A[CR]Z Button: N/A[CR]Start Button: Starts game/Pauses game[CR]Mode Button: N/A[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Level 5, Wild Thing 2000, lots of Cash -[CR]Enter The Following Password at the password Screen:[CR]R7EF TU0R[CR]The ''0'' is a Zero, not The Letter O.[CR]- Level Codes, loads of money, Wild Thing 2000 -[CR]Enter these codes at the password screen for $300,000 and the Wild Thing 2000:[CR]Level 1: 8CKE 1U0M[CR]Level 2: 8CKE 2U0N[CR]Level 3: 8CKE 3U0O[CR]Level 4: 8CKE 4U0P[CR]Level 5: 8CKE 5U0Q[CR]Note: Most of the 0's are the number, but the O at the very end of the Level 3 code is the letter.[CR]- Super Password -[CR]Enter the following code at the Password Screen....[CR]15S9 - PU03[CR]Then when you play the game you will have $200 000 and the Wild Thing 2000[CR]- Cheat Mode - [CR]To go to Level 3 with the DMG 1000, $20000 in your pocket, and a range of weapons, press ABRACADABRA on the title screen (where R is Right and D is Down).

The NES version had a unique feature of its own, with RoboCop incurring damage in his individual body parts that could be repaired between levels.[CR]RoboCop 3D, which was made at the same time and loosely based on the same movie, was also published by Ocean for home computers such as the Amiga, Atari ST and PC but was developed by Digital Image Design instead. It has considerably different gameplay, focusing on first-person shooter gameplay with an engine that uses early examples of polygonal graphics.[CR]The OCP Rehab officers have rolled into Old Detroit, demolishing the homes of hapless families to make way for the construction of OCP's Delta City. Armed with a jetpack and arm attachment with large-bore cannons RoboCop attempts to ward off the corporate overlords and defend the rights of citizens.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 6,6,5,6 adding, \"...Ocean has taken the extra time and effort to make this sequel a much better playing game.

It was ported to the Genesis the following year, with an additional track.[CR]The game is based on Silicon & Synapse's earlier RPM Racing. Rock N' Roll Racing was meant to be a sequel to RPM Racing (its tentative title was \"RPM II\") until the decision to include licensed heavy metal and rock and roll music came about, at which point the name was changed to take advantage of this inclusion.[CR]Blizzard later rereleased Rock N' Roll Racing on the GBA. A demo version of the game was uploaded onto their PC online service Battle.net, emulated through ZSNES. The game's lasting legacy means it continues to see imitators to this day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A screenshot of the Super Nintendo version of the game[CR]The game puts four racers up against each other racing around tracks on various planets. Up to two players can play together while the rest is AI controlled. The game is viewed from an isometric view.[CR]Although the title indicates that this is a racing game, there is a major emphasis on attacking competitors with many different weapons (rockets, mines, etc.) Although players respawn rather quickly, the cash bonus handed out for kills is always a good reason to fire that last rocket. Tracks are littered with various pickups such as oil slicks, mines, and health and money packs. Sometimes, depending on the planet the race is being hosted on, various obstacles like lava or snow, can appear.[CR]Commentary is given by Loudmouth Larry (voiced by Larry \"Supermouth\" Huffman,) who chimes in throughout the race at key moments:The stage is set, the green flag drops!Let the carnage begin!Rip is about to blow!Hawk should avoid mines!Olaf lights him up!Holy Toledo!Olaf Unleashes Hot Fury![CR]Between the races, players can spend their hard earned money on outfitting their cars with more weapon charges, better parts (like improved bumpers or tires), or just buy a new car.

It was ported to the Genesis the following year, with an additional track.[CR]The game is based on Silicon & Synapse's earlier RPM Racing. Rock N' Roll Racing was meant to be a sequel to RPM Racing (its tentative title was \"RPM II\") until the decision to include licensed heavy metal and rock and roll music came about, at which point the name was changed to take advantage of this inclusion.[CR]Blizzard later rereleased Rock N' Roll Racing on the GBA. A demo version of the game was uploaded onto their PC online service Battle.net, emulated through ZSNES. The game's lasting legacy means it continues to see imitators to this day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A screenshot of the Super Nintendo version of the game[CR]The game puts four racers up against each other racing around tracks on various planets. Up to two players can play together while the rest is AI controlled. The game is viewed from an isometric view.[CR]Although the title indicates that this is a racing game, there is a major emphasis on attacking competitors with many different weapons (rockets, mines, etc.) Although players respawn rather quickly, the cash bonus handed out for kills is always a good reason to fire that last rocket. Tracks are littered with various pickups such as oil slicks, mines, and health and money packs. Sometimes, depending on the planet the race is being hosted on, various obstacles like lava or snow, can appear.[CR]Commentary is given by Loudmouth Larry (voiced by Larry \"Supermouth\" Huffman,) who chimes in throughout the race at key moments:The stage is set, the green flag drops!Let the carnage begin!Rip is about to blow!Hawk should avoid mines!Olaf lights him up!Holy Toledo!Olaf Unleashes Hot Fury![CR]Between the races, players can spend their hard earned money on outfitting their cars with more weapon charges, better parts (like improved bumpers or tires), or just buy a new car. The races always last for four laps and a nice cash and point reward is split between first, second, and third place. Players need to win a certain amount of points to be allowed to enter the next division on that planet, which features tougher opponents and a higher point requirement to advance.

[CR]When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a ball.  The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball.

You can still hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind special doors. The mission timer from the previous game has been replaced by a sniper that targets you with a crosshair when you don't move fast enough. The brutal difficulty from the previous games has been toned down: there are more life marks at the start and you now resurrect where you died, rather than returning to the last checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only choose one character to play with.[CR]After completing a mission, a password is provided to continue playing.

They can select from six specific starting points during the conflict to join, with certain warlords and nations being more or less powerful depending on the circumstances of the war at this time.[CR]Several new additions are made to the sequel, including the ability to intercept enemy messengers, relying on advisers to predict the outcome of an action and a reputation system which lowers if the player continues to do reprehensible things and may even convince allied officers to defect to the enemy.[CR]",

[CR]Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction. [CR]The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder). There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament (\"Party mode\" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).[CR]Reviewer: Luis Silva [CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/pete-sampras-tennis-96[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play against Robot on Lunar Surface[CR]Enter the following Codes as Password for play the last match against robot:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play against Robot on Lunar Surface[CR]To play as Robot, enter ROBO as a password.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become \"enraged\" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] No Music During First Round of Any Match[CR]During any match intro, wait until both characters jump out at the same time and the screen begins to turn white, then press Start. The music will be silent for the first round.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Saturday Night Slam Masters (known in Japan as Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion) is a 2.5D wrestling game developed and released by Capcom for Arcade (via the enhanced CPS-1 hardware) on July 13, 1993. The game plays similar to other Arcade wrestling games of the time (taking place in a standard wrestling ring where the player has three-dimensional movement of their characters). However, the game includes original international (and colorful) characters, including Mike Haggar from the Final Fight franchise, wrestling to climb the ranks of the fictional Capcom Wrestling Federation (CWF).[CR]All versions of the arcade game featured a Single Match (featuring traditional one-on-one matches) mode. Arcade cabinets that supported four players featured a Team Battle Royale mode (featuring two-on-two elimination matches). An updated version of the Arcade release (titled Muscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle in the international version and Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors in the Japanese version) was released on December 1993, removing Single Match mode (focusing on the Team Battle Royale mode) while refining the grappling mechanics, adding new moves (for all characters) and allowing players to select the same character.[CR]Saturday Night Slam Masters was ported to the FM Towns Marty (in Japan only) on November 1993, and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis in 1994. While the SNES version was the only version to include Team Battle Royale mode (thanks to multitap accessories), the Genesis version includes an exclusive Death Match mode, which grants more weapons to use, covers the ropes with barbed wire and proximity explosives (making it impossible to bounce off the ropes, but allows players to damage their opponents by throwing them at the ropes), and lays land mines outside the arena.[CR]On September 2, 1994, the game received a sequel, titled Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters II, which refined it to a traditional fighting game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game controls not unlike a simplified Capcom 2D fighting game, including a single button for attacks, a jump button and a grapple button. Wrestlers can also run against the ropes of the ring, creating a new set of running attacks. Each wrestler featured has one unique special move as well as a finisher they can perform from the grapple once they had depleted their opponents health bar low enough. Once the opponent's health bar is either completely empty, or close to empty, the wrestler can attempt a pin to win or use a submission move to make their opponent quit. Matches can also end with a 20-count ring out.[CR]The game features two play modes: Single Match, which featured traditional one-on-one wrestling matches, and Team Battle Royale, which featured two-on-two elimination style matches. In Team Battle Royale, both members of a team have to be pinned or submit for the other team to win. Players could either form a cooperative team, or a single player could have a CPU controlled partner. If playing Team Battle Royale in single player, the match ends in a \" No Contest\" if the player character is pinned and his CPU controlled partner is not.[CR]The game also features the ability to leave the ring. Various weapons can be found that allow a wrestler to greatly damage their opponent. The game features no disqualifications for using weapons.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]CharacterBioAlexander \"The Grater\"Alexander \"The Grater\" (known in the Japanese version as Sheep the Royal) is an American wrestler (Australian in the Japanese version) and butcher (from Kentucky, U.S.A.).He is based on the real life wrestler Big Van Vader.Biff SlamkovichBiff Slamkovich (known in the Japanese version as Aleksey Zalazof) is a Russian wrestler (from Kiev, Ukraine) and the main protagonist of the series.Also known as \"The Rocking Ruskie\", he is an apprentice of Mike Haggar, and considers fellow apprentice Gunloc as his rival.

Once the player has completed Dessert, a monkey will run by and snatch the last star. Grover then must chase after the monkey to retrieve his last star, after which the game will move on to the next day.[CR]After the first day, Sesame Street denizens will start appearing in the kitchen playing around with food items. Sometimes their activities with a food item will end up landing on Grover's tray, which may result in Grover carrying an unwanted food item, forcing him to give the food to Cookie Monster and having to collect the correct food items all over again.",

It just so happens that one of the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans and decides to bestow his power to four of the strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat Ashura and his minions.[CR]The player takes control of these four warriors who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one female). Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.[CR]The game has 9 different stages. The player can play the first six (mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) in any order. Each round ends with a boss which must be defeated to clear that round.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]To be invincible, start a two player game, when one of the characters used run out of life points and their death animation begins, have the other player press the start button.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is an enhanced adaptation of the original Shadow Dancer Arcade game, released by Sega for the Sega Genesis in 1990. The Master System version took elements from both the original Arcade version and this version, though is more heavily based on the former.[CR]As well as a separate bonus mode that closely resembled the original Shinobi's shurikens mini-game, the game also featured a different control scheme for Yamato, the dog that acts as the secondary protagonist, as well as various small improvements and a different plot.Differences From the Original Arcade Version[CR]There are two versions of the Genesis port's story due to localization, where the plot and the protagonist's identity have been altered. In the original Japanese plot of the Mega Drive version, the main character is Hayate, who was brought over to America and raised by \"Dick C. Kato\", along with his pet dog Yamato. Hayate and Yamato set out to avenge Kato's death after he is killed by the mysterious organization called the Union Lizard. In the English version of the game the main character is Joe Musashi, the father of Hayate, and Kato is made into one of his students who dies. Yamato is made Musashi's pet dog after the original owner dies and the two seek vengeance.[CR]Another distinction between the Genesis version and the Arcade version is that there is a meter that is filled by holding the attack button; upon release Yamato will attack the nearest enemy so long as he is barking, allowing for much more versatility in its usage than in the original.[CR]Though exclusive to the Genesis for a long time, the game eventually became available on the PC/PS2/PSP (as part of the Sega Genesis Collection) and the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]After bringing down the Neo Zeed organization. Joe Musashi found his skills weren't needed anymore. He went to New York city and spent some time with Kato, his former martial arts student.[CR]Musashi returned to his native land, refreshed and relaxed. Kato, meanwhile, heard that some nasty characters had taken over a local elementary school, and were holding the children as hostages. Naturally, he went to try and help the kids. What he found was shocking.[CR]Kato was severely wounded at the school, and was not expected to survive. When he got the news, Musashi raced back to New York. But before he could get to the hospital, Kato passed away, leaving nothing but memories and his faithful dog, Yamato. Overcome with grief and rage, Joe Musashi promised Kato's mother that he would avenge her son's death.[CR]Kato perished at the hands of one of the many Ninja warriors belonging to Union Lizard, a frighteningly vast and powerful group that took orders from a hideous, gigantic reptilian form. Since it could not communicate through words, the reptile's instinct guided it and many soldiers on a path that would result in world domination -- if no one stopped them. They've taken over New York, and are holding many terrified people hostage. Can you guide Joe Musashi and Yamato, the shinobi dog, through the ring of fire and triumph over this evil force?[CR]~Passage from the game manual.[CR]Yamato[CR]Yamato, once the pet of Musashi's late friend Kato, now gives his loyalty to our hero. Yamato isn't just a spectator -- He'll lay down his very life for you![CR]~Description of Yamato from the manual.[CR]Times when Yamato can't attack:When there are no enemies on the screen.When Yamato and the enemies are on different floors.When an enemy Yamato was planning to assault suddenly jumps up or down to a different level. In this case, Yamato charges straight ahead, and after seeing that there's no one there, returns to his master's side.[CR]Levels (Genesis/Megadrive)[CR]Burning Down town- 1[CR]This level is set in Brooklyn, the boss of the level is; 'The Stomper!'.[CR]Battle on the Railway-2[CR]Set in a railway station, the boss of this level is; 'The Mirage!'.[CR]Statue of Liberty-3[CR]Set in the Liberty Statue, the boss of this level is; The Blade!'.[CR]In the Darkness-4[CR]Set in a terrifying cavern, the boss of this level is; 'The Wheel of FIre!'.[CR]The Reptile Sauros-5[CR]The lair of the game's ultimate protagonist 'Sauros'.

He must be quick, so he can go back to a charity basketball game in downtown Tokyo![CR]Despite the game's smooth animation and crisp graphics, the game was widely panned for its difficult controls, inconsistent hit detection, and silly concept.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG initially released for the Sega Genesis. The game was later ported to PC, iOS, and the Wii Virtual Console; a remake, which was titled Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon, was released for the Game Boy Advance.[CR]The game was the brain-child of  Hiroyuki Takahashi, who left working on the  Dragon Quest franchise in 1991 to form his own company Camelot. His previous effort,  Shining in the Darkness, laid the groundwork for some of the series' ideas.[CR]Takahashi's goal in entering the RPG space was to focus on interesting battle mechanics more than simply creating a compelling narrative, which was the focus of many popular contemporary RPGs. He has revealed that the  PC game Silver Ghost had a significant influence on the development of Shining Force.Story[CR]The game is set 1000 years after Dark Dragon, a malevolent three-headed dragon, was banished to another dimension.[CR]The player controls the protagonist (canonically named Max) and his army, with the intention of preventing the dragon from being resurrected by Darksol, The Lord of Darkness.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shining Force is a  turn based Tactical RPG in which the player controls multiple units on a grid based battlefield. Units range from melee fighters to ranged combatants, magic users, and flying birdmen, each with different movement ranges. Battles take place at scripted points throughout the game, on both the  world map and field map locations. Instead of grinding random battles, one leveling tactic involves having the main character die multiple times during a battle.  Alternatively, the main character has the spell Egress, which is a retreat spell for entire team. Either way, all team members keep their experience even if they are killed in battle or even if they retreat via the egress spell. [CR]Unlike some other Tactical RPGs, Shining Force features extensive field map exploration through a variety of towns and other locations. Over the course of the game the player will meet a wide cast of characters, many of whom can be recruited to the players party. Most characters are required additions, but there are also additional characters who can be met at various points in the adventure. There is a limit to the number of units taking part in a battle, however there are many more to be found in the game. Units are held in a headquarters which is an available area in every town. Inside of the headquarters the player can engage in conversations with all his units, which change according to the games events, and the units that make up the current battle party can be selected. Equipment and Items can be purchased at shops in towns for each unit.[CR]Once units that reach level 10, they can be  promoted, which changes their appearance and abilities. Promoted characters reset to level 1. The player can promote any unit between level 10 and 20, with the benefit of waiting allowing the unit to become ultimately stronger.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]HeroMax[CR]The protagonist, canonically named Max, can only wield swords and he automatically has the spell Egress, which lets the entire party escape from battle. He is a very powerful character, but if he dies, the party surrenders. He is also the only character who can wield the powerful Chaos Breaker.HealersLowe [CR]Lowe is the protagonist's best friend and he automatically joins at beginning of game. He automatically starts with the Heal spell, and he eventually learns Detox, Dispel, and Quick. He is a good starting character but has trouble keeping up with the party as the game progresses. He becomes a Vicar after his promotion.Gong[CR]Gong is waiting at a house outside of the first battle of the game. He is the strongest of all the healers in the game, but he is limited in combat when compared to the stronger characters on the Shining Force. He only learns two spells: Heal and Aura (he can only learn Aura level 1).Khris[CR]Khris, the deer-kin, automatically joins the party after freeing the protagonist from prison in Chapter 1. She is much like the other healers, but she does learn some powerful spells early in the game. She starts with Heal and eventually she learns Slow, Quick, and Aura (she only learns Aura level 2). She becomes a Vicar after her promotion.Torasu[CR]Torasu joins the Force as players leave Prompt in search of the tower of the ancients. He is the most powerful healer in the game. He learns Heal, Detox, Shield, and Aura; he is the only character in the game to learn Aura level 4, which cures all party members wherever they are located. He becomes a Vicar after his promotion.Knights (Centaurs)Ken[CR]Ken joins the party after speaking with the king at the beginning of the game. He can use lances and spears, and he normally has a lot of HP. Ken starts out as a strong character, but much like many of the knights, he becomes weak around the middle of the game. He can be promoted to become a Paladin.Mae[CR]Mae joins the force after the king is killed in Chapter 1. Mae is great early in the game. She boasts an incredible amount of defense and she has average attack stats, but much like Ken, Mae becomes weak around the middle of the game. She can be promoted to become a Paladin.Arthur[CR]Arthur is in Manarina, which is the same mage school where Anri is located in Chapter 2. He is on the upper floors of the school, and he is doing laundry. He joins the force if players talk to him after speaking with the Spirit of the Holy Spring. As well as melee attacks, he can also learn to cast Level 1 Blaze, Freeze, and Bolt.Pelle[CR]Pelle is originally an enemy mercenary, but he joins the force after Runefaust attempts to murder him at the end of Chapter 3. He can use lances and spears, his stats level up more evenly than Mae and Ken.Vankar[CR]Vankar joins after being fired from his initial role as a guard in Chapter 4. Like the other Knights, he can use lances, spears, and can be promoted to become a Paladin.Earnest[CR]Earnest joins right before the fight in the Fortress of Balbazak. He is a revenge ridden centaur looking for vengeance on Balbazak. Like the other Knights, he can use lances, spears, and can be promoted to become a Paladin.WarriorsLuke[CR]Luke joins the party after meeting the king in Chapter 1. As a warrior, Luke is strong melee character. He has high defense, high attack, and a large amount of HP. He is a solid character throughout the entire game. He excels in Chapter 5 if he is equipped with the Heat Axe, which is dropped by a Lizardman during battle. Once he is promoted he becomes a Gladiator. Warriors' movement is not prohibited by forests and mountains.Gort[CR]Gort can be found in a bar to the right of Guardania in Chapter 1, but he only joins the force after the city is left in ruins. Gort is generally accepted as the lesser of the two warriors because he lacks the HP growth of Luke. But since stat growth is randomized in Shining Force, he can become more powerful than Luke. He boasts both solid defence and attack. Once he is promoted he becomes a Gladiator, and he shares the Warrior movement bonus.MagesTao[CR]Tao joins the party after the player talks to the king in Guardania. She is a strong character in the first half of the game, and she learns the strong spell Blaze 4 during the earlier parts of the game. However, this spell is weaker than other spells. Another one of her strengths is her ability to cast boost, which can really help with levelling weaker characters. When she receives her promotion, she becomes a Wizard.Anri[CR]Anri joins in chapter 2 after players inform her that her father was killed. She is a more powerful mage than Tao, but she is less versatile. Her best spells are Freeze 4 and Bolt 2. She also learns Blaze 2 and Muddle. She also has high Defence. When she receives her promotion, she becomes a Wizard. A solid choice.Domingo[CR]Domingo is a secret character. To get him, in the mage school of Manarina, there is a odd looking giant statue with large teeth. If players search it, then they will find a Domingo Egg. Upon arriving at Poa (the traveling town), after defeating Elliot in battle, Players must talk to the man to the right of the item salesman. He will hatch the Domingo Egg, which allows Domingo to join the Shining Force. Domingo is the only flying character that can use magic. Also, he is a tank/mage. He has a lot of HP, MP, and defence.Alef[CR]Alef the lynx-kin joins the Shining Force as players leave Prompt for Valley of the ancients. She is a 'glass cannon' at higher levels. She joins late in the game and she is not promoted. If she levels up far enough, she learns the strongest spell in the game, Bolt 4. The main problem is that Bolt 4 takes a large amount of MP to cast. When she receives her promotion, she becomes a Wizard.ArchersHans[CR]Hans joins after players talk to the king in Guardania, at the beginning of the game. He has high speed, but deficient in HP, attack, and defense. He gets promoted to Bow Master.Diane[CR]Diane joins the force if players speak with her at the beginning of Chapter 3; she is in a house in Bustoke. She is more powerful than Hans, but less so than Lyle. She gets promoted to Bow Master.Lyle[CR]Lyle can be found on top of a tower in Rudo in Chapter 6; he is the only centaur to also double as an archer. He has the movement of a Knight, and he outclasses Hans and Diane in almost every important stat. His initially joins the party at a low level, but because of his ability to keep his distance, he can safely level up.Aerial WarriorsBalbaroy[CR]Balbaroy is a Bird Warrior who joins the force after being saved from zombies in the Shade Abbey. He is Amon's friend.Amon[CR]Amon is a Bird Warrior who joins after being saved from zombies in the Shade Abbey. She is Balbaroy's friend.Kokichi[CR]Kokichi is a Flying Knight who must first be met in Bustoke; however, he joins in Pao only if players have previously talked to him in Bustoke.Miscellaneous CharactersZylo[CR]Zylo is a Werewolf driven crazy by Runefaust. He joins after players cure his insanity with Lunar Dew in Bustoke.Guntz[CR]Guntz is a Steam Knight who joins the Shining Foece in Pao (after defeating Elliot); however, he is first met in Rindo. He has high defense and attack attributes, but low movement speed. He gets promoted to Steam Baron.Musashi[CR]Musashi, a Samurai, is a hidden character who joins the party by simply reading a hidden sign on a house in Prompt, and is one of the most powerful characters in the game.Hanzou[CR]Hanzou is a Ninja who joins the Shining Force after finding him hidden in the bushes of Runefaust.Bleu[CR]Bleu is a dragon character first met in the city of Dragonia. He is the last living 'Great Dragon' in Dragonia. Initially, he is depicted as be cowardly, but later becomes courageous. He gets promoted to Great Dragon.Adam[CR]Adam is a mechanical man who joins the Shining Force in Metapha. Before promotion, his class is Robot; afterwards, it is Cyborg.Jogurt[CR]Jogurt the Yogurt is a joke character who only has 1 HP and is incapable of doing any more than 1 damage at a time in battle. If he does manage to defeat an enemy, he gains the Yogurt Ring, which, when equipped on another character, makes them look exactly like Jogurt, including his profile image. Players meet him in the same area that Gong is recruited; however, he does not join until much later.Planned CharactersShell[CR]In addition to the characters above, a few planned characters were cut from the final implementation stage. One of these is Shell (pictured), the first NPC players meet in the Mermaid village. Although she was cut as a playable character from the final version of the game, her character portrait was left in the code. This makes her one of the few NPCs in the game with a character portrait (Nova and the kings being the others). A lizardman was also supposedly planned as a playable character, but was scrapped before any implementation into the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Misc. Codes[CR]Beat the game, allow the ending to completely finish and the game to reset. The sound test is opened by loading a saved game or starting a new one, and entering the code while the screen fades to black after Simone stops talking.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Avoid Party Members[CR]The game forces you to allow Tao, Ken, Lowe, Hans, and Luke to join the party before the first battle of the game.  There is a way to avoid getting these characters in your party.  To do this, when in town at the opening of the game there is a gate but two guards will stop you if you try to leave. There is a blond man in a purple vest near the gate and if you stand one space above him, you will eventually force him to step in the path of one of the guards.  At this time you can run past and exit the gate and the guard will not be able to block you.  This will send you to the first battle with only Max, making the game quite difficult.  Also, even though you avoid taking these characters in your party, they will still speak during some of the cut scenes.  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Avoid Party Members[CR]Before the battle against Chaos is over, cast egress. Adam will be at HQ, and will be battle-ready. Normally you would have to speak to him after the battle, giving you the chance to miss recruiting him.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Avoid Party Members[CR]As soon as you get Heal 4 and try to use it, press Left to change it to level 3. The spell range of 3 spaces will flash. Then press B to change it back to level 4. It will have the same range as level 3[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 2 jogurts?[CR]If you put jogurt in your army and kill an enemy with him you get item jogurt ring use in battle on any character and they will look just like a jogurt too! repeat as many times as you want but you will have to get another ring when it breaks.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 2 jogurts?[CR]During the Laser Eye battle in Chapter 3, search to the left of the three dark elves.  You'll receive one of the hidden items in the game called Kitui Huku (Tight Clothes in Japanese) give it to Anri and she'll have a new outfit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 2 jogurts?[CR]In Chapter 3, after fighting the first battle to get the Moon Stone, go inside the cave and search the walls and you will find a secret item called the Sugoi Mizugi. Then, give it to Tao, and now she will have an alternate costume in when fighting in battle.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shining Force 2 opens following the thief Slade as he attempts to steal two precious jewels from an ancient shrine. Unbeknown to him these jewels are actually the seal on Zeon, the Devil King, and by stealing them he has let a great evil forth upon the world.[CR]In the kingdom of Granseal stands the Tower of the Ancients. The king of Granseal is attacked by an unleashed devil and it falls upon Sir Astral and his pupils, led by the protagonist Bowie, to investigate the attack and the strange occurrences at the Tower. Bowie, the other students of Sir Astral and the mysterious Phoenix Peter will form the basis of the Shining Force; their mission will take them across the world and pit their forces against Zeon's in an attempt to seal him away once again.[CR]The Shining Force[CR]The game is focused on a team of warriors known as the Shining Force. There are several different classes in the game, but they fall under the general areas of melee combat, ranged combat, and magical combat. As they level up they will learn new abilities and more powerful versions of their current abilities, but for the most part they will be increasing in attack, defense, hit points, magic points, and other standard RPG statistical categories.[CR]Most characters will also have the ability to be promoted (at level 20 and beyond) to some upgraded class as well; the promoted classes bring even more powerful attacks and abilities to the force. In some cases promotion may even completely change a character's focus, for instance the priest can be promoted to a master monk which is much more powerful physically but loses many of its healing powers. However, when a unit is promoted it will become level 1 in it's new class. This penalty is somewhat mitigated by waiting until later levels to promote the character, but at the same time the promotion classes are much more powerful in some cases, so the decision is a tough one for the player.[CR]Battles[CR]Battles in Shining Force 2 involve tactical missions in which 12 (or fewer) members of the player's party face off against a group of enemies. The goal is simple: either defeat all the enemies or their leader. However, players have to be careful, as they will lose if the leader, Bowie, is killed. Unlike most tactical RPGs, there is no game over. Players will be revived in the last church they have visited and given the opportunity to fight the battle again with any experience or items that were earned before being defeated.[CR]Combat takes place in standard tactical RPG fashion. The battle occurs on a grid of squares and each character occupies a single square with the exception of some of the most powerful characters in the game. Each character will get the chance to move and perform an action on their turn. The amount of movement is dictated by the characters class and the terrain they are fighting on. After moving there are four actions:Attack[CR]Attacking allows the chosen character to enter combat with the enemy. There are two basic types of attacks: melee and ranged. Melee attacks may be made against enemies that are adjacent to the character. Ranged attacks can attack enemies that are two, three, or even more spaces away from the attacking character, but generally cannot be preformed against enemies that are directly adjacent. Some weapons, like spears, allow the character to make melee or ranged attack, but they are generally short ranged.[CR] Magic[CR]Magic spells generally have a larger range similar to ranged attacks. Generally as the magic attack gets more powerful it also has a larger area of effect, as well as a higher cost. Spells range from elemental magic to summoning to healing magic and death magic.Items[CR]Each character can carry four items at any given time. Most character use a melee weapon so effectively each character has three spots for items. Most of the time these will be healing items such as healing seeds or antidotes, but since the characters lack a communal item storage, anything that the player wishes to carry must be carried by a character in the force. In battle items are generally used on the characters holding them or someone adjacent, but items like Healing Rain will affect all friendly characters.Stand By[CR]The last command is to stand by which ends the character's turn.[CR] [CR]Leading the Force[CR]In between battles the game takes many cues from standard RPG traditions. As Bowie the player will explore towns, talk to NPCs, buy items, and generally manage the force.The Church[CR]Most towns have a local church which provides several essential services to the Shining Force. At the church, the player canremove curses or poisons from force membersrevive members that have fallen in battle. Note that if Bowie dies he is automatically revived, as is Peter, the phoenix.promote members to a new class if they are between levels 20 and 40save the gameHeadquarters[CR]A headquarters is available in one city which allows players to manage who will appear in the battle party. Players are given the ability to do this outside of the headquarters within a few battles of the party growing beyond the maximum party size. This mobile headquarters also has the ability to store additional items and access them between encounters.[CR]Differences from Shining Force[CR]While Shining Force 2 is a sequel to the original game the stories are not directly related, but they are in some way connected by  Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflct for the Game Gear.[CR]There are several other differences:The game is no longer broken into chapters. This allows for a lot more exploration and allows players to go back to areas earlier in the game.The interface is vastly improved.There is more breadth in the character classes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Configuration Mode[CR]While the Sega logo is on screen enter the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Configuration Mode[CR]When the witch asks you to select your file, select a file already beaten (or set a file with the config code) and hold Up and Start and press A.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random numbers arent random[CR]Trying to get that spell to always hit or get that +4 on all your power up items, but you just can't seem to get the random to work for you?  Well I discovered the counter to the random number generator is the number of steps taken.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random numbers arent random[CR]Say you save your game and use an item for a stat increase.  Well if its not what you wanted, reload and take one more step befor using it.  The pattern I noticed was something like 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4.   Thus taking 5 steps gave me my +4.  This works for spells that don't hit very often. Fun with desoul.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boost L2 level up Trick[CR]When one of your characters learns the spell Boost and gets it to level 2, use it and make sure you get your ENTIRE party in range. This will give 49 Exp. to the one who casted Boost L2 REGUARDLESS of what level anybody may be in (which is, like killing a formitable monster that might be much stronger than you). Then, when the Boost effect wears off, you can repeat this sequence and easily get to level 99![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boost L2 level up Trick[CR]After selecting the name for the main character, hold [START] as you choose \"End.\"  Another name screen will pop up for another character and you get to name everyone else.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boost L2 level up Trick[CR]Give a healer any HP restoring item (I.e. Medical Herb), and use it on themself. This will garner a quick 10 experience points for the healer. If you don't have herbs, use Heal 1 until you run out of MP. You could possibly have Heal 4 and Blast 4 for Sarah before you even finish the first battle in the game if you do it right. Also, if you use Aura and have 3 or more people in the targeted range, the healer will get 25 experience for their effort. If you use Detox on one, the healer will only get 5 experience. Make sure to do this trick if you want easy victories.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boost L2 level up Trick[CR]There is one more battle you can do once the game is completed. Once you've defeated Zeon, watched the end credits, and reached the ''FIN'' screen with the two jewels, wait for about 2 mins. A message will appear that says ''and more...''. press a button and you will begin a special battle with all of the old greater devils.",

At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.[CR]The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.",

Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of \"Maggie\", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the \"spin the wheel\" minigame.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Level oneLocation: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: MaggieLevel twoLocation: Shopping MallBoss: Ms. BotzHelper: MargeLevel threeLocation: CarnivalBoss: Sideshow BobHelper: LisaLevel fourLocation: MuseumSub-Boss: TyrannosaurusBoss: Dr. MonroeHelper: HomerLevel fiveLocation: Power PlantHelper: Maggie, Marge, Lisa, and HomerNo Boss[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Sound Test[CR]Shoot the E in the Kwik-E-Mart sign with a rocket.

Based on the license for the animated television series The Simpsons, the game puts the player in the role of Bart Simpson. [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Bart falls asleep at his desk.  [CR]As the game opens, Bart is working hard on his homework for once, but as the day goes on he becomes increasingly tired. He eventually falls asleep at his desk and his nightmares take him to a strange world. Bart has to collect the lost pages of his homework in his dream and avoid waking up prematurely.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is split up into two sections: Evergreen Terrace and Page Worlds.Evergreen TerraceEvergreen Terrace can get pretty crazy[CR]When on Evergreen Terrace, Bart wanders around the streets looking for pages of his homework that are floating around. The player's health is represented by a row of Zs near the top of the screen. If the player takes damage, a Z is lost. If all Z's are lost, the screen will lose most of its color. If the player takes damage again while in the \"white out\" state, Bart will wake up and the game will end. The player is then given a letter grade based on how many points they earned and how many pages of homework they gathered.[CR]There are a large amount of hazards that the player will encounter while on Evergreen Terrace.  Lisa Simpson flies around and sprinkles fairy dust on the player, turning Bart into a  frog. There are also  basketballs that bounce down the street, Jebediah Springfield's statue heads, mail boxes that cross the street, Otto speeding by in his bus, and Blinky the Fish. Many of the obstacles can be defeated by simply jumping over them which will award the player with points.[CR]The player is not completely defenseless here though. Bart can collect  power-ups by killing enemies, encountering certain popular Simpsons characters, and use watermelon seeds and  bubble gum to aid him. If the player is stuck as Frog Bart, they can wander into an old lady who will blow Bart a kiss that will return himto normal. Bubble gum allows Bart to regain health by spitting it at Z's floating around the street.  Principal Skinner also wanders around the streets carrying Bart's church outfit. If the player runs into him, Bart will don the  suit which will slow his movement speed but make him resistant to enemy damage.Page WorldsHmm... choices[CR]Once a homework page appears in Evergreen Terrace, the player will have to jump onto it which will shrink Bart down and be given the choice of two randomly chosen  mini-games represented by colored doors. If the player doesn't choose a door Bart will always go to the one on the left.[CR]The door colors are:Purple Door: Bart takes a journey into his own blood stream where he has to destroy germs using an air pump to inflate them until they pop.Blue Door: Bart becomes his superhero persona, Bartman. The player flies over  Springfield dodging missles, storm clouds, paper airplanes, and irradiated clouds. There are also boss fights with familiar Simpsons characters Sherri and Terri, Barney Gumble,  Waylon Smithers, and  C. Montgomery Burns. Nelson occasionally flies by using a hand glider to attack Bart and  Apu will ride a magic carpet dropping power-ups that replenish the player's health.BARTZILLA!! Yellow Door: Bart is transported into an episode of  Itchy and  Scratchy taking place in the Simpsons' house. The player has to defeat the cat and mouse using weapons scattered around the various areas while avoiding damage from insane household items like  refrigerators,  vacuum cleaners, telephones, and pictures of the Simpson family.Orange Door:  Indiana Bart must find his way through the  maze in the Temple of  Maggie. The player has to jump from four rows of stone platforms, some will drop if stepped. The player also has to avoid pterodactyls, the Devil, and projectiles fired from the background.Green Door: Bart becomes Bartzilla, stomping through the streets of Springfield battling army jets,  tanks, and  helicopters. Eventually the player will reach the Springfield State Building where they will battle Homer  Kong and Momthra on the roof.[CR] The game grades your skills[CR]If the player manages to reach the end of one of the mini-games, they'll collect a page of Bart's homework. If the player completes a mini-game level (page collected) or loses all of their lives (failed to collect page), the game flash to Bart sleeping in his room and display the player's score and how many pages they have collected. If the player manages to complete every mini-game and collect all of the lost homework pages, they will be given the game's proper ending.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]During the opening section when Bart is falling, press:",

Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.[CR]A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheater Menu[CR]Enter the code on the password screen.  If done correctly, the game exits back to the title screen.

The object of each level is to eat as many Nibbley Pibblies (round creatures of various colours) as possible to make your snake heavy.  Once it's heavy enough, you must stand on the scales in the level, and if you're heavy enough, the door will open and you can make your way to the exit.[CR]As with many platform games of its era, Snake, Rattle 'n Roll is incredibly difficult.  Foes include Jaws, a monster that's all teeth and will kill you if you stay in the water too long, and Bigfoots, which stomp all over the place and require multiple tongue lashings to defeat.  Then there's the many types of Nibblies, such as Pibblesplats, which hop around and splat into puddles, Pibbleboings, which are spring-loaded and jump incredibly high, and Pibblewings, which fly high out of reach.[CR]Two-player mode provides both a co-op and competitive experience: while you are both trying to eat more Nibblies than your opponent, if you both stand on the level's scale at the same time, both of your weights will be counted and it will be possible for you to exit the level more quickly.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Snow Bros. is an action game developed by Toaplan and published by Capcom for multiple platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Much like Bubble Bobble, Snow Bros takes place on single screens where the objective is to \"trap\" enemies and then destroy them via chain reactions. In this game, the enemies are trapped by shooting snow at them: when enough snow has been thrown at an enemy, they become a snowball that can be pushed around and/or kicked. If a snowball is left idle for too long, the enemy will break free. Kicking the snowball causes it to ricochet around the stage, taking out any foes in its path. The snowball (and the enemy within it) is destroyed upon hitting the bottom walls of the screen. Other snowballs can be launched when a moving snowball hits it. This creates the ability to setup chain reactions. The best way to rack up points is to create a chain reaction that kills every enemy on screen with a single kick of a snowball.[CR]When enemies are destroyed, they leave behind a food item (often sushi or ice cream) worth points upon collecting. If you manage to do a 100% chain reaction, large tickets appear from the top of the screen, worth 10000 points each. You can move on to the next stage/screen after killing all enemies. Time is limited in each screen- taking too long results in an invincible monster appearing to chase and kill you (another similarity to Bubble Bobble).[CR]There are several power ups (resembling potions) available to the player, which spawn at random from a dead enemy. Red potions increase the speed of your character; Blue potions increase the strength of your snow (meaning you can make enemies into snowballs faster), and Yellow increases your range. Green potions engage a bonus stage that fills the screen with new enemies, each representing a letter of the word \"BONUS\". Each one you kill results in you earing the corresponding letter- getting all of them results in a 1-UP. The final power up inflates your character into a baloon, which makes you invincible and able to move throughout the stage quickly- any contact with enemies kills them.[CR]Every 10 stages ends in a boss encounter.[CR]The NES version of the game introduces cut scenes and a more fleshed out story. However, this version has many of the stages and enemy layouts altered from the arcade version. A Mega Drive version came out in Japan and Europe and is something of a collectiors item- garnering high prices on Auctions. An official sequel called Snow Bros 2: With New Elves came out shortly after. A homebrew Snow Bros 3 was made and distributed in South America.[CR]",

The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.[CR]Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.[CR]There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.[CR]The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.",

                "plot": "In the year 3300, human technology advances drastically when a super computer known as GCS-WT is created after an AI circuit is developed and utilized. GCS-WT's purpose was to ultimately unify every human society using the power of diplomacy, but GCS-WT has other plans: rather than unify mankind, GCS-WT turns societies into a dystopia after becoming an all-powerful dictator who controls all military action as it sees fit and oppressess mankind of various liberties; anyone who spoke against GCS-WT's will did not live very long.[CR]Only one man was the most successful in running a campaign against GCS-WT: a scientist known as Edwin Feace. Feace had fled SOL completely and stationed himself near a recently discovered planet dubbed Cilius that awaited colonization. It was there that Feace secretly established a resistance group against GCS-WT and developed a multi-directional, dual-occupant space fighter called the Sol-Feace. The Sol-Feace was Edwin's plan to use against the GCS-WT and any who fell under its militaristic order in hopes of releasing human suppression. However, Edwin was assassinated under GCS-WT's command before the ship could be mass produced in a violent manhunt in space. Two survivors escaped the destruction that followed Edwin:[CR]    - Eric Williams - A young pilot prodigy who was selected by Edwin to control the Sol-Feace and to organise its armaments.[CR]    - Misao Hatanaka - The cannon-gunner of the Sol-Feace, Misao is a weapons engineer who, with her knowledge in computers, contributed to the Sol-Feace project.[CR]Together, the two go on to continue Edwin's mission: pilot the Sol-Feace and destroy GCS-WT.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Players pilot the Sol-Feace in a fight against strategic enemy fighters. Players use a dual cannon pick-up weapon that can fire shots in diagonal angles. The cannons can be positioned to fire straight or diagonally only when the ship is not firing its weapons and can fire different shots depending on the weapon.[CR]Weapon power-ups include the following:[CR]    - Blaster - Standard vulcan type weapon.[CR]    - Wide Blaster - Bi-directional weapon that can fire from the top or bottom of the ship under each cannon.[CR]    - Melt ray - Laser weapon, fires long beams of semi-powerful lasers.[CR]    - Burn Bullet - A stream of rocket-fire that explodes on impact and can spread partially behind the ship against ground forces as the shots bow outward when fired. Obviously, the strongest weapon in the game, but not entirely the fastest.[CR]- Levels -[CR]The levels of Sol-Feace take the players across two galaxies on various seek and destroy missions.[CR]    - Level 1: Sirius - The largest colony of humans was set here, but GCS-WT's order left the vastly populated colony a cloud of metallic parts floating adrift in space.[CR]    - Level 2: Sirius Moon Weapon Facility - Simply put, a large weapon facility used by GCS-WT.[CR]    - Level 3: Artificial Sun - A sun made entirely by GCS-WT for an unknown purpose.[CR]    - Level 4: Microcosm P-1 - An unused cruise ship that was thrown into battle once Sol-Feace continued its strikes.[CR]    - Level 5: A Station on Pluto - A supposedly weak space station that's under construction set near Pluto.[CR]    - Level 6: The Moon Amalthea - The strongest base developed under GCS-WT's rule set on Amalthea (moon) as the primary defense against any outside forces (in this case, the Sol-Feace).[CR]    - Level 7: Earth - an unknown location in which GCS-WT is stationed.[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Level Skip -[CR]To skip levels while you are playing, enter the ninety-nine lives and level select code.

They do not fire bullets, except they have their own \"shots,\" exclusive to each other. They both pass through monsters which in turn can cause damage to any monster or spawn device behind it. The Pistol's Flame shot can be upgraded to fire two shots at once where as the Lightning Gun's Lightning will only have one shot that eventually grows to a larger size.[CR]Sub-Weapons/items can also be bought in the shop, as well as stats and lives, after every 2 stages. Each character will have one Sub-weapon/items each at the start. Only 2 Sub-weapons/items can be held at one time (one for each character) which, in 1 player mode, can be swapped by pressing the space bar. Holding down the fire button activates a Sub-weapon/items.[CR]Sub-weapons/items include screen clearing sticks of dynamite, Bombs, Maps, First Aid Boxes, Molotov Cocktails and 8 way bursts of bullets. Items will similar effects are found in game as well.[CR]- Levels of play -[CR]There are four worlds, each consisting of four levels. The worlds (in order of visitation) are \"Forest\", \"Workshops\", \"Fortesque Mansion\", and \"Sewers\", each with its own dynamic industrial music score. The players must traverse through each level, picking up power-ups, gold and keys to pass through the various puzzles and mazes. A number of \"nodes\" must be activated via weapon fire to open the final doors at the end of the level. Secret routes and hidden items are plentiful along the way. At the end of every second level the player has a chance to spend their collected riches to upgrade their weapons, increase the number of hit points of their character, purchase new items and improve other character attributes. Finally, at the end of the sewers the players will face up to the Chaos Engine itself in a last battle. Upon its destruction, the narrator of the game is revealed to be the Baron himself, trapped within the machine and studded with implants. His final words are: \"I have guided you here so that you might set me free. The Chaos has ended... you will be remembered.\"[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Level Select for Brug and CPU Thug -[CR]World 2[CR]Password - M8HT3WJ8KQ44[CR]World 3[CR]Password - 8HBBTX2MCHTJ[CR]WOrld 4[CR]Password - RCT7C4MYR854[CR]- Level Select for Gentleman and CPY Navvie -[CR]World 2[CR]Password - Q3BK7PYNS794[CR]World 3[CR]Password - LV6W7QK0NYB5[CR]World 4[CR]Password - RW#75#FJ40TH[CR]- Level Select for Navvie and CPU Scientist -[CR]World 2[CR]Password - LQ1LX2#81Q59[CR]World 3[CR]Password - C48YLCVLM0GM[CR]World 4[CR]Password - CRR56F82GN5K[CR]- Level Select Scientist and CPU Navvie -[CR]World 2[CR]Password - 7LJLHPHMWBN1[CR]World 3[CR]Password - 3B5YXP5D#8H9[CR]World 4[CR]Password - H485R95CQT93B[CR]- Over $40,000 in 2-player mode -[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:[CR]LQYDH8223VL6 - $40,000 for a 2-player game[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/console/genesis/home/586467.html[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/console/genesis/code/586467.html[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chaos_Engine[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select for Brug and CPU Thug[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Knuckles the Echidna is now in your control.[CR]Sonic & Knuckles is a 2D action platformer developed by Sonic Team (with assistance from Sega Technical Institute, which would be the last Sonic game they contributed to) and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on October 18, 1994.[CR]The direct sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Sonic & Knuckles continues the story of Sonic the Hedgehog, who must venture deeper through Angel Island to track down Dr. Robotnik (whose orbital weapon, the Death Egg, crashed back down to the floating island). Along the way, he is still being pursued by Knuckles the Echidna who, still believing that Sonic is planning to steal the island's Master Emerald, hinders his progress and is still hiding the Chaos Emeralds around the floating island.[CR]While Miles \"Tails\" Prower is no longer a playable character (or companion), players can now play through the game as Knuckles (previously only playable in Sonic the Hedgehog 3's Competition Mode), in which he is less agile than Sonic (and cannot use the special jumping powers of elemental shields), but has the unique abilities to glide through air, climb walls, and punch out certain obstacles (as well as having to face more difficult boss battles as an added challenge). He has his own side-story, taking place after the main campaign, in which a surviving badnik (the EggRobo) takes Dr. Robotnik's place in finding the Master Emerald (though it is not sure, until the end of the game, who the main antagonist is).The unique Sonic & Knuckles cartridge, with Sonic the Hedgehog 3 locked on top of it.[CR]Sonic & Knuckles is the only Sega Genesis game to utilize special \"lock-on technology\" (in which the unique game cartridge features its own Sega Genesis cartridge slot at the top, similar to the Game Genie accessory), so that the game can access data from certain other Genesis games. This allows players to play through Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as Knuckles (complete with his unique abilities), and allows players to combine both Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles into one \"complete\" game with special features.Ports and Compilations[CR]The game was later ported (alongside Sonic the Hedgehog 3) by Sega to PC (running Windows 95 and up) as Sonic & Knuckles Collection (published by Sega for Japan in 1997 and Expert for North America in 1999). The game retains the same gameplay as the Sega Genesis version, but the music was re-done in MIDI format. It also includes the option to play Sonic 3 & Knuckles (both games locked-on) and also includes a Sonic-themed screensaver.[CR]Sega compilations that include both Sonic & Knuckles and all of its lock-on functionality (as separate modes) include Sonic Jam (on July 31, 1997 for the Saturn), Sonic Mega Collection (on November 10, 2002 for the GameCube), and Sonic Mega Collection Plus (for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on November 2, 2004 and for the PC on March 9, 2007). Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on February 10, 2009) includes the game but none of the lock-on functionality. Sonic Classics Collection (for the Nintendo DS on March 2, 2010 in Europe only) includes the game and both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 functionality.[CR]The game has been ported and digitally released on the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console on September 9, 2009) and Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on February 15, 2010). Both releases are programmed so that if the owner has downloaded this and any of the three Sonic games originally required for lock-on functionality, he/she can play that Sonic game as if it was going through the Sonic & Knuckles lock-on technology.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Sonic & Knuckles, players control either Sonic the Hedgehog or Knuckles the Echidna as they navigate through 6-8 levels (known as \"Zones\", split into different \"Acts\") to track down Dr. Robotnik (in Sonic's campaign) or the lone EggRobo (in Knuckles's campaign). Players must dodge dangerous obstacles (such as spikes and bottomless pits) and plow through enemies (with attacks such as the rolling jump) to reach the end of each Act.Zones[CR]Like Sonic the Hedgehog 3, each main level (known as Zones) are split into two unique sections (known as Acts), each act with a unique setting (such as Sandopolis Zone starting out in the vast desert and ending up inside a haunted pyramid) and music. The first act ends with one or more mini-bosses to fight and the second act ends with a boss to fight.[CR]Hidden Palace Zone and Sky Sanctuary Zone have only one \"act\" and both serve as two \"acts\" to one \"level\". Both are heavily shortened and modified for Knuckles's campaign (the first as a simple transition and the second as the Knuckles's final boss battle). Death Egg Zone and Doomsday Zone cannot be played as Knuckles. Doomsday Zone can only be played as Super Sonic (or Hyper Sonic in Sonic 3 & Knuckles) and has only one \"act\", serving as the Sonic's final boss battle.[CR]In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, all of the Sonic & Knuckles levels appear immediately after all of the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 levels.Mushroom Hill ZoneFlying Battery ZoneSandopolis ZoneLava Reef ZoneHidden Palace ZoneSky Sanctuary ZoneDeath Egg Zone (Sonic Only)Doomsday Zone (Super/Hyper Sonic Only)[CR]Lock-On Technology[CR]Using the game's special \"lock-on technology\", players can access special modes and features by putting any Sega Genesis cartridge on the cartridge's additional cartridge slot.[CR]Booting up the game without any cartridge locked-on plays Sonic & Knuckles normally. With most cartridges locked-on, the game shows up a special \"No Way!\" screen (in which players can play a secret random pre-generated Special Stage by pressing all buttons simultaneously).[CR] Blue SphereThe screen that appears after locking on Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR]With Sonic the Hedgehog locked-on, one of the message in the \"No Way!\" screen changes to \"No Way?\" and pressing all buttons simultaneously unlocks a deeper Special Stage game (known as \"Get Blue Spheres!\" or, retroactively, as \"Blue Sphere\"). Players can play a series of pre-generated Special Stage levels (up to 134,217,728 configurations of varying difficulty) and keep track of their progress using a 12-digit numerical password.[CR]Earning a \"Perfect\" in the stage (by collecting all possible rings) skips ahead 10 stages. Players start at level 1 and can change the password before entering the stage (including passwords given out after completing a Special Stage with any other cartridge).[CR]There were plans to make Knuckles playable in Sonic the Hedgehog, but the concept was later scrapped because of issues with Knuckles's abilities in the game's levels.[CR] Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2Knuckles in Emerald Hill Zone, the first level of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.[CR]With Sonic the Hedgehog 2 locked-on, players can play Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, in which they can play through the entirety of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as Knuckles. Knuckles retains all of his abilities, and the game adds some new hidden items (that makes use of Knuckles's abilities). Two-player mode (including Time Trials mode) is disabled.Sonic 3 & KnucklesKnuckles in Angel Island Zone, the first level of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.[CR]With Sonic the Hedgehog 3 locked-on, players can play Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which combines both games into one \"complete\" game (with the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 campaign leading to the Sonic & Knuckles campaign in one long story). With this setup, players can play the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 campaign as Knuckles (complete with branching paths, due to his abilities, and a harder EggRobo boss at the end of each zone), play through the Sonic & Knuckles campaign as Tails (or as Sonic with Tails), and save their progress in the Sonic & Knuckles campaign (complete with more save slots).[CR]In addition, players who reach the Sonic & Knuckles campaign with all seven Chaos Emeralds can trade them for the ability to collect seven Super Emeralds (Chaos Emeralds powered-up by the Master Emerald). When they have all seven Super Emeralds, they can transform into Hyper Sonic (who, in addition to the abilities as Super Sonic, gains the ability to perform a mid-air dash that flashes the screen, clearing all enemies on the screen), Hyper Knuckles (who, in addition to the abilities as Super Knuckles, triggers a earthquake when clinging on to a wall, clearing all enemies on the screen), or Super Tails (who has the abilities of Super Sonic as well as being surrounded by four super-powered Flickies that automatically charge at enemies on the screen).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug mode and all Emeralds (locked-on to Sonic 2)[CR]First activate and go to the Stage Select. Play the tracks in Sound Test with button B in this order:  [CR]01 09 09 04 01 00 01 08  [CR]This enables the Debug code, you should hear a ring chime if the code is entered correctly. start the selected level with A+start.

I think you have to do the level select code first.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug mode and all Emeralds (locked-on to Sonic 2)[CR]Start a game and go to Angel Island Zone Act 1.  Go to one of the swings that you hang from and grab on.  While Sonic is swinging, press Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Up, Up, Up.  You will hear a ring if you entered the code correctly.  Pause the game and press A to take you back to the title screen.  Press Down twice to find the newly unlocked Sound Test menu.  Enter it, where you can play all of the sounds/music in the game and warp to any level. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Blue Spheres Passwords[CR]Lock-On Sonic 1 or Sonic Classics, at the No Way! screen press A + B + C. The screen will now say ''Get Blue Spheres!''. At the bottom of the screen is a Code Number Password, change it to any of the fallowing passwords and press Start to activate it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Walk through walls[CR]On levels that allow you to travel upwards or downwards greatly as you progress as Sonic, go to an area where Knuckles' path starts. Hold down and wait for the screen to drop, then jump (do not spindash). If done correctly at a area that will cause this, the screen will shift and scroll in a loop back to you. During this time, you are free to walk through walls. This can also be done in select areas of levels where there is no path for Knuckles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus game trick[CR]Put a game other than Sonic 2 or 3 in the top of the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge. Then, when it shows the picture of the trio and the message at the top, press A, B, and C simultaneously to play Bonus Games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode (Locked-On to Sonic 3)[CR]1.

Enter Sound Test again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode (Locked-On to Sonic 3)[CR]5. Select a stage of your choice.  Once the Zone and Act title dissapear, you may release A, B, and C.  There are a few differences in button layout now.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode (Locked-On to Sonic 3)[CR]A: (Normal Mode)Makes Sonic jump normally.  (Debug Mode)Duplicates the selected item.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode (Locked-On to Sonic 3)[CR]B: Toggles between Normal Mode and Debug Mode[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode (Locked-On to Sonic 3)[CR]C: (Normal Mode)Reverses Gravity.

You should hear the ring sound. Pause and press A to be taken to the title screen. Highlight either Sonic or knuckles as your character, and press start while holding A. The menu shows all levels in the game, but some are specific to a certain character, so you can't play those if you picked an incompatible character. Any time you want to exit and select a different level, just repeat the code from right after the pulling machine part.",

Doomsday Zone can only be played as Super Sonic (or Hyper Sonic in Sonic 3 & Knuckles) and has only one \"act\", serving as the Sonic's final boss battle.[CR]In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, all of the Sonic & Knuckles levels appear immediately after all of the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 levels.Mushroom Hill ZoneFlying Battery ZoneSandopolis ZoneLava Reef ZoneHidden Palace ZoneSky Sanctuary ZoneDeath Egg Zone (Sonic Only)Doomsday Zone (Super/Hyper Sonic Only)[CR]Lock-On Technology[CR]Using the game's special \"lock-on technology\", players can access special modes and features by putting any Sega Genesis cartridge on the cartridge's additional cartridge slot.[CR]Booting up the game without any cartridge locked-on plays Sonic & Knuckles normally. With most cartridges locked-on, the game shows up a special \"No Way!\" screen (in which players can play a secret random pre-generated Special Stage by pressing all buttons simultaneously).[CR] Blue SphereThe screen that appears after locking on Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR]With Sonic the Hedgehog locked-on, one of the message in the \"No Way!\" screen changes to \"No Way?\" and pressing all buttons simultaneously unlocks a deeper Special Stage game (known as \"Get Blue Spheres!\" or, retroactively, as \"Blue Sphere\"). Players can play a series of pre-generated Special Stage levels (up to 134,217,728 configurations of varying difficulty) and keep track of their progress using a 12-digit numerical password.[CR]Earning a \"Perfect\" in the stage (by collecting all possible rings) skips ahead 10 stages. Players start at level 1 and can change the password before entering the stage (including passwords given out after completing a Special Stage with any other cartridge).[CR]There were plans to make Knuckles playable in Sonic the Hedgehog, but the concept was later scrapped because of issues with Knuckles's abilities in the game's levels.[CR] Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2Knuckles in Emerald Hill Zone, the first level of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.[CR]With Sonic the Hedgehog 2 locked-on, players can play Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, in which they can play through the entirety of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as Knuckles. Knuckles retains all of his abilities, and the game adds some new hidden items (that makes use of Knuckles's abilities). Two-player mode (including Time Trials mode) is disabled.Sonic 3 & KnucklesKnuckles in Angel Island Zone, the first level of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.[CR]With Sonic the Hedgehog 3 locked-on, players can play Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which combines both games into one \"complete\" game (with the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 campaign leading to the Sonic & Knuckles campaign in one long story). With this setup, players can play the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 campaign as Knuckles (complete with branching paths, due to his abilities, and a harder EggRobo boss at the end of each zone), play through the Sonic & Knuckles campaign as Tails (or as Sonic with Tails), and save their progress in the Sonic & Knuckles campaign (complete with more save slots).[CR]In addition, players who reach the Sonic & Knuckles campaign with all seven Chaos Emeralds can trade them for the ability to collect seven Super Emeralds (Chaos Emeralds powered-up by the Master Emerald). When they have all seven Super Emeralds, they can transform into Hyper Sonic (who, in addition to the abilities as Super Sonic, gains the ability to perform a mid-air dash that flashes the screen, clearing all enemies on the screen), Hyper Knuckles (who, in addition to the abilities as Super Knuckles, triggers a earthquake when clinging on to a wall, clearing all enemies on the screen), or Super Tails (who has the abilities of Super Sonic as well as being surrounded by four super-powered Flickies that automatically charge at enemies on the screen).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug mode and all Emeralds (locked-on to Sonic 2)[CR]First activate and go to the Stage Select.

At the bottom of the screen is a Code Number Password, change it to any of the fallowing passwords and press Start to activate it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Walk through walls[CR]On levels that allow you to travel upwards or downwards greatly as you progress as Sonic, go to an area where Knuckles' path starts. Hold down and wait for the screen to drop, then jump (do not spindash). If done correctly at a area that will cause this, the screen will shift and scroll in a loop back to you. During this time, you are free to walk through walls. This can also be done in select areas of levels where there is no path for Knuckles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus game trick[CR]Put a game other than Sonic 2 or 3 in the top of the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge.

Just jump into the semi-hidden bed of spikes on the right and land in the cannon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Becoming Super Sonic in Emerald Hill - an alternate way[CR][B]Note[/B]:  Moving at twice normal velocity can often get you stuck in a wall.

The last level, \"Special Stage\", repeats itself once the level is beaten. Only by locking the original Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Compilation in the Sonic & Knuckles cart can one play through all the stages. The other Genesis/Mega Drive games will only play one level each, which will infinitely repeat. Despite being near randomly generated, the levels are playable for the most part, even if many bits and pieces of levels get recycled.

These strange birds have magical properties, and one of those powers include traveling to different dimensions through large gold rings. Also on this island are the seven Chaos Emeralds that have incredible powers. Dr. Robotnik discovers this island and he realizes that these 7 gems are here. Then, he finds the Flickies and turns them into robot minions to help him search for the Emeralds.[CR]Sonic, who is a friend of the Flikies, shows up at the island. He finds what his nemesis Robotnik has done to them, and now it's up to Sonic to destroy all of Robotink's badniks to free all of the Flickies. Sonic and the Flickies then help each other out to prevent Dr. Robotnik's plans. That is where the birds ability to transport to altered dimensions comes in. This useful power is the way to get to Robotnik and ultimately stop him from getting the Chaos Emeralds and gaining the power to rule the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Playing as Sonic, the player must destroy Robotnik's robots or badniks in order to release the trapped Flickies. Then the player has to collect those Flickies in order to advance to the next zone by going through a large gold ring. The player has to collect five Flickies to advance. The game has seven zones each with three acts. Act 1 and 2 are regular levels which the player explores around the level, destroys enemies, and collects Flickies. The third act is a boss battle.Sonic in \"3D\"[CR]Their is four types of enemies each level and each of those enemies releases a different colored Flicky. Blue Flickies try to find Sonic and when they can't find him they fly around in circle. Pink Flickies are the same as blue ones, but fly around in a larger circle. Red Flickies fly from point A to point B and they don't try to find Sonic, they also jump at times, and they are difficult to catch. Green Filckies make no attempt to find Sonic and move around randomly. Once Sonic reaches and touches him they follow him around. If Sonic is attacked by an badnik he loses a Flicky and he must get him back.[CR]Controlling Sonic and other gameplay features are much like other Sonic games. For the Genesis, the D-pad moves sonic around the area, the A button and C button make Sonic jump, and the B button makes Sonic roll into a ball and do a spin dash. And, like many other Sonic games, collecting rings prevents Sonic from dying when he is attacked by enemies.[CR]Zones[CR]The game's levels consist of seven full zones, each comprising two regular acts and one boss act, and one final boss zone that is only accessible to the player if Sonic has collected all Chaos Emeralds. Interestingly, Sonic 3D Blast follows Sonic CD's convention of using alliterations for zone names.Green Grove ZoneGreen Grove Zone[CR]This tropical zone is typical of the first zone in a Sonic game. Waterfalls, bridges and loop-de-loops adorn Sonic's journey as he speeds across the checkered floor in search of flickies. In the boss fight, Robotnik tries to drop a spiked ball on Sonic from his hovercraft and can be hit when he descends to collect it.Rusty Ruin ZoneRusty Ruin Zone[CR]An ancient ruins zone in the vein of Marble Zone from the original Sonic and Marble Garden Zone from Sonic 3. Certain tiles put Sonic into a special twirling state that allows him to smash through certain otherwise unbreakable obstacles. The boss fight requires Sonic to jump onto the claws of a large statue in order to reach Robotnik who resides in its head.Spring Stadium ZoneSpring Stadium Zone[CR]Spring Stadium Zone plays yet another Sonic clich\u00e9 rather straight, fulfilling the role of the mandatory pinball level. Sonic ricochets off bumpers, pops balloons and shoots off flippers as he makes his way to the end of the zone, where Robotnik chases him with a hovercraft equipped with spiked claws.Diamond Dust ZoneDiamond Dust Zone[CR]An ice level reminiscent of Ice Cap Zone in Sonic 3. Strategically placed turrets threaten to turn Sonic into solid ice, while strong currents of melting snow carries the struggling hedgehog into spiky traps. The boss features Robotnik attempting to freeze Sonic with ice shooters, occasionally lowering his craft to drop a snowman bomb.Volcano Valley ZoneVolcano Valley Zone[CR]In sharp contrast to the preceding level, Volcano Valley Zone has Sonic navigating a lava level reminiscent of Lava Reef Zone in Sonic & Knuckles. Destructible rocks reveal hidden passages in this volcanic maze where Sonic must jump over broad pools of magma and avoid many a fire-spewing trap. The fire shield (red) is particularly useful in this zone. In the boss arena, Sonic must outrun a tongue of flame as he aims hits at a very stationary Robotnik.Gene Gadget ZoneGene Gadget Zone[CR]A largely mechanical level filled with industrial fans and dangerous electric traps. The lightning shield (blue) is particularly useful to avoid getting Sonic electrocuted. The boss involves our hero dodging mines on a large treadmill as Robotnik fires missiles at him from his hovercraft.Panic Puppet ZonePanic Puppet Zone[CR]Another industrial themed level, Panic Puppet Zone is special in that Sonic frees flickies from special containers rather than from Badniks. The boss for this zone, and the final boss if Sonic does not have all the Chaos Emeralds, requires Sonic to advance through several tiers of battle mechanics.Final Fight Zone[CR]The last boss of Sonic 3D Blast is a deadly machine, naturally crafted in the likeness of its master, which chases Sonic through a series of puzzles that loops until the hedgehog is able to land enough hits on the contraption.[CR]Wii Virtual Console version[CR]The Genesis/Megadrive version Sonic 3D Blast was eventually made available for purchase and download through Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service. However, the game was criticized in reviews, one reason being that the game can't be played using the control stick, even if you use a Classic Controller to play it. Using the control stick doesn't do anything; only the directional pad would work. (It is unknown whether the fault lies with the Virtual Console platform itself rather than the people who ported Sonic 3D Blast to it.)[CR]Music & Audio[CR]The music in the game was composed by Jun Senoue, Masaru Setsumaru, Seirou Okamoto, and Tatsuyuki Maeda. They all crated the Genesis version's music, while the Saturn/PC version was composed by Richard Jacques. The Mega Drive/Genesis version's soundtrack was somewhat latter used in other Jun Senoue projects; the music in Sonic Adventure had some elements of the soundtrack. The game over and continue themes were reused from Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles.[CR]Debug Tap[CR]Soon after the release of the Genesis Sonic 3D Blast, a technique was discovered to get to a debug mode, the technique was to tap the side of the Sega Genesis with some slight power with your finger, has in flicking it, soon after the screen would make a screech and then turn blue, after 2 seconds a menu would pop up allowing the player to select any level in the game with has many lives has the player wanted - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp1uTXPNlzE[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Go to the Press Start screen and enter the code: B,A, Right, A, C, Up, Down, A (or baracuda).

A good place for doing this would be in Oil Ocean Zone, Act 2, near the first set of pop-tops and cannons.  Just jump into the semi-hidden bed of spikes on the right and land in the cannon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR][B]Note[/B]:  Moving at twice normal velocity can often get you stuck in a wall.  Also, this wears off if you Super Spin Dash or Spin Dash.  It also only lasts for that Act.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Normally, when you turn into super sonic you lose tails behind you all the time.  [CR]Well, after you put in the debug cheat and have started a level (preferrably Emerald Hill), turn yourself into a box and place it somewhere on the floor WHILE you are super sonic. It should be a switch places box. Hit it and you will see tails will have a permanent invincible circle around him. He will stay like this through the whole level, he will keep up with super sonic or even out run him. A very fun glitch for 2 players.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]If you beat the Death Egg with Tails you get the Tails ending.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Go to the sound test (not the one on the level select) and put in 19, 65, 09, 17, 01, 01, 02, 04 (press A after each one). There won't be a confirmation sound. Start the game by pressing Start on the first option (character select) and you should have 14 continues.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]First, you enter the stage select code, shown above. Then you go into the Special Stage in the stage select menu. Every time you finish the special stage press reset and go back to the special stage. Keep doing this until you get the sixth emerald. Then you don't press reset. It will just zap you with your six emeralds into emerald hill. Get the last emerald on Emerald Hill get  50  rings and jump to be super sonic. Be careful to not run out of rings or else you will change into Sonic again. The rings start dissapearing when you are Super sonic.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]First, enable the level select cheat and the debug mode which are available here. For this to work, you must choose Sonic and Tails as the players. [CR]After entering the codes, choose any stage from the level select menu(preferrably stage 1) [CR]As soon as you can move Sonic, hold down, and press C(don't let go of down on the D-pad). This will activate Sonic's spin; Tails will copy the Sonic spin also. [CR]Press the B button and Sonic will become the Debug cursor.(Tails will be locked in the sonic spin move). [CR]Press A until you(the debug cursor), displays an enemy sprite, like the monkey or that bee robot. Now that the debug cursor displays an enemy sprite, move the debug cursor to where Tails is, and repeatedly tap C. [CR]This will produce enemies where Tails is, and since Tails is locked in the sonic spin move, he will destroy the enemies. As Tails destroys enemies in this position, press C more until the score for destroying an enemy increases from 100 to 8000 to a 1up. Once you have enough 1ups, press B again to revert to Sonic.",

Block: Similar to Normal mode, but blocks will not fall out of formation until a match is made, allowing for impressive clear combos.[CR]These modes can be played either single player or two-player simultaneous on separate fields.

His monstrous contraption, the Veg-O-Fortress, built on Mt. Mobius, is already transforming happy creatures into mindless slaves![CR]Robotnik's fiendish machine draws its power from the mountain's volcano. Fiery lava fuels the lethal Pinball Defense System that protects the Fortress.[CR]Sonic and his pal Tails mount an air assault on the Fortress, only to be blasted in mid-flight by Robotnik's cannons. Sonic is knocked into deep waters near the volcano. But he has friends in wet places -- and is saved at the last moment![CR]Sonic sneaks into the Toxic Caves below the Fortress. From there, he infiltrates Robotnik's vast and deadly defenses. In no time at all, Sonic starts swiping Emeralds, freeing the animals of Mobius and dishing out hedgehog justice![CR]Yo, Robotnik! You're in for a mountain of trouble now. Sonic is spinning into action![CR]--from the Genesis Sonic Spinball instruction booklet[CR]Sonic Spinball is a lot of fun to play! It mixes two things people love: Sonic the Hedgehog, and Pinball. The graphics and sounds were pretty good. I used to play this game a lot. It's cool because you can try to beat the game, or you can just see who can get the highest score. If you like Sonic or Pinball, Sonic Spinball is right up your alley![CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]The evil Dr Robotnik is back again. Now Sonic (and you) must stop him, in this pinball style game![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Sonic Spinball is essentially the logical continuation of a tradition of pinball themed levels that started with Spring Yard Zone on Sonic the Hedgehog. The game features four large pinball 'tables' - a sewer level, a geothermal power station, a robot factory, and a launchpad system. The player must guide Sonic through each of the four levels and collect all of the Chaos Emeralds, then fight Dr. Robotnik.[CR]Once all of the Chaos Emeralds in a level are collected (3 in the first two levels, 5 in the last two levels), Sonic gains access to the boss room and has to defeat a boss to advance onwards.[CR]The main difference between this game and an actual pinball game is the ability to influence the \"ball\" (Sonic) directly by using the D-pad. The A, B and C buttons operate the flippers and can be assigned in the Options menu. Sometimes the player can control Sonic on foot, but for the majority of the time he is rolled into a ball controlled by the flippers. The traditional Sonic the Hedgehog platformer gameplay is kept to a very low minimum.[CR]- Levels -[CR]Sonic in The Machine Zone.[CR]- Zones -[CR]    - Toxic Caves (known as Toxic Pools on the 8-bit versions): Sonic is flushed into a cavern full of toxic waste and mine carts, which happens to be the place where Robotnik dumps all of the industrial waste. There are 3 Chaos Emeralds to collect here that must be obtained by hitting multiple switches. In 8-bit versions, the design for this level has completely changed.[CR]    - Lava Powerhouse: Sonic ascends to the next level, a power station of sorts that uses magma and steam energy to run various machines. There are 3 emeralds here.[CR]    - The Machine: There are 5 emeralds here in this high-tech level. Sonic can also find a giant-sized animal prison in the very middle of this zone.[CR]    - Showdown: Sonic has to find 5 Chaos Emeralds and reach the top of the Launch site to defeat Dr. Robotnik before he manages to escape.[CR]- Special stages -[CR]At the end of each of the first three stages, Sonic gets to play a bonus round. These bonus rounds are set up like real pinball machines, with Sonic at the controls. The player is given a task to complete and three balls to play with. Flipper controls are the same as in the normal game, but the ball cannot be controlled with the D-pad like Sonic. Pressing all the flipper buttons at once will make Sonic shake the machine, though repeated shakes will cause a tilt and lock the flippers.[CR]Completing the bonus stages are optional and serves only to increase the player's score. The three bonus rounds, in corresponding order to the normal zones, are:[CR]The Game Gear version of Toxic Caves (renamed Toxic Pools in this version).[CR]    - Trapped Alive: The object is to destroy all the robot machines and free the helpless animals trapped inside them and then destroy Robotnik. Among the prisoners are Sonic's Freedom Fighter pals from the SatAM cartoon: Tails, Bunnie Rabbot, Sally Acorn, and Rotor Walrus.[CR]    - Robo Smile: A grinning Robotnik face moves across the machine. The objective is to knock out all of Robotnik's teeth.[CR]    - The March: Similar to Trapped Alive, the object is to destroy the capsule and free the animals and Freedom Fighters within. The capsule is circled by a ring of Scratch robots.[CR]Additionally, a hidden multi-ball bonus game, called The Clucker's Defense, can be played on any stage, but only if the player manages to collect every ring in the zone. Several star circles will appear in the stage, hidden at various points on the board. By leaping into them Sonic will be warped to this bonus round. The object is to destroy a crab Badnik who is protected by a pair of Cluckers.[CR]Reviewer: Adrian[CR]https://www.consoleclassix.com/genesis/sonic_spinball.html[CR]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Spinball[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Launch credits[CR]At the options menu, enter the opposite of the level select code: C, Up, B, Up, A, Up, C, B, Down, C, A, Down, B, A, Down.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog is a 16-bit  platformer released for the  Sega Genesis. It was the first game in the  Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, and also the first game developed by  Sonic Team. It was released in 1991 in North America, Europe and Japan. It is one of the best selling video games of all time, and thus a giant money maker for  Sega, creating a popular evergreen franchise and also propelled the Genesis to widespread popularity.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]As with most games of the era, the majority of the game's plot is contained within the instruction manual. Essentially, Doctor Robotnik is capturing all of the animals on Sonic's home of South Island to act as power sources for his robot army, and he desires the power of the six mystical  Chaos Emeralds to help further his world domination plot. Sonic doesn't like the sound of this, and sets off to rescue his animal friends and collect the emeralds before Robotnik.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In the game the player takes control of Sonic (the Hedgehog) who is tasked with preventing Doctor Ivo Robotnik - or Doctor Eggman in Japan - from taking all 6  Chaos Emeralds in order to rule South Island, by instead collecting them himself. Sonic travels through 21 acts, split into 7 zones with 3 acts each. At the end of the third act of each zone the player fights against Doctor Robotnik in one of his many vehicles. The twist is Sonic's ability to run at extreme speeds which allows him to go through levels with loops, springs, high falls, and extreme slopes; and he must avoid rows of sharp spikes, bottomless pits, enemies, and other obstacles. Sonic has two attack moves: a spinning jump and spinning roll, and he can use both of these to combat enemies, break through certain walls, and smash open power-ups.[CR] Gold rings are scattered around the map - similar, but quite different, to  coins in  Super Mario Bros. Collecting 100 rings gives the player an extra life - similar to how collecting 100 coins in  Super Mario Bros. garners the player a  1up. Rings also act as a layer of protection against traps, as Sonic will drop all his rings upon coming into contact with a trap, only losing a life if he has no rings when it happens.Levels[CR]There are six different zones (levels) contained in Sonic The Hedgehog, each of which has its own unique aesthetic. There are three acts to each zone. They are: Green Hill ZoneDr. Robotnik, as the first boss in a Sonic game.[CR]This first zone sees the first appearance of some famous Sonic trademarks. Players whirl through checkered  loop-de-loops and speed past  palm trees against a vibrant and colorful background. At the end of act three, Dr. Robotnik shows up in a pendulum-like device that swings a large ball back and forth across the screen. Marble Zone[CR]This zone puts players in an ancient ruin that is apparently in close proximity to a  volcano. Players are forced to avoid  lava  lakes and waterfalls and they jump from platform to platform. After, Dr. Robotnik arrives with a  flamethrower mounted under his ship and proceeds to drop flames on the two platforms, which are on either end of the screen. Spring Yard ZoneThe Spring Yard Zone[CR]This mountainous zone places the player in a giant  pinball themed stage. Players must push through copious bumpers and avoid steep slopes as they make their way to the end of act three, where Dr. Robotnik waits. Here, he has a giant spike attached to the bottom of his ship and proceeds to break apart the platforms the player walks on, effectively making this battle harder the longer it goes on. Labyrinth Zone[CR]Here, players are put into an ancient maze that has sunken into the sea. This is arguably the most difficult stage in the game, as players are introduced to a new gameplay mechanic,  water. While submerged, the player can jump higher, but is slower and will drown if an air bubble is not consumed every so often. At the end of this zone, players must chase Dr. Robotnik through a vertical corridor, while avoiding  spears and, of course, the rising  water level. Star Light ZoneStar Light Zone[CR]This starry zone is set amongst an aerial construction site. Players will have to avoid some high-powered fans that will impede their progress, and will have to utilise others to advance in the level. At the end of act three, players will have to use see-saw like devices in order to hurls spike balls up at Dr. Robotnik, who will continuously drop spike balls down on the player. Scrap Brain Zone[CR]The final zone of the game is set in one of Dr. Robotnik\u2019s grimy, polluted industrious cities. Players will have to avoid saws and traverse conveyor belts as they make their way through the level. In act three, players have to re-live an environment similar to that in the Labyrinth Zone. This area, however, has a certain touch of Dr. Robotnik about it. The water is polluted, and the walls a dull grey. Once players finish this, they will face off against Dr. Robotnik in the  final boss battle of the game. Here, there are four pistons. Two pistons will simultaneously move and try to crush the player, the doctor will appear in one of these and it is up to the player to use their reflexes in order to hit the right one.[CR]If the player completes the game with none or only a few Chaos Emeralds, Dr. Robotnik will taunt the player triumphantly juggling the leftover Emeralds and challenge the player to \"Try Again.\" To get the good ending, the player will need to have obtained all 6 Emeralds, which can only be acquired from the game's 6 Special Stages.Secret Zones[CR]If the player has 50 or more rings at the end of any act, Sonic can warp to the secret zone by jumping through the giant golden ring. Sonic's  spin attack allows him to ricochet off the spinning  maze. The aim is to grab the  Chaos Emerald from the middle of the maze.[CR]There are six Chaos Emeralds to find, one in each of the secret zones, if the player collects them all it will unlock an alternative ending to the game.[CR]Items & Objects[CR] Rings: As long as Sonic has rings he will not lose a life if he is hit by an enemy, he will simply spill the rings on the ground and he will have a time limited opportunity to recollect them. If he is hit when he has no rings, he will lose a life. Lamp Posts: The only checkpoint system in the game, when Sonic crosses through a lamp post the player's score and time are recorded. If the player loses a life Sonic will restart the current act at the last lamp post he activated.[CR](The following items are obtained by smashing video monitors with Sonic's spin attack)Super Ring: Equivalent to 10 or more rings.Shield: Protects Sonic from losing rings by protecting him from one attack.Power Sneakers: Enables Sonic to run at super sonic speed, and increases the tempo of the music to give an extra sense of speed. 1-Ups: Gives Sonic an extra live. Invincible: Makes Sonic invulnerable to enemy attacks for a short period of time.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed by  Masato Nakamura, Bass Guitarist for Japanese Pop Music band Dreams Come True. Masato would mail each song on cassette to Sega's offices, where they would then translate the melody to a music format the Sega Genesis could understand. A number of songs submitted were based off of similar melodies found in popular Dreams Come True tracks.[CR]Development History[CR]Rabbit Concept Art[CR]On April of 1990 Sega held a contest internally among development teams in an effort to create a game to define the company. Sega's AM8 development studio (later renamed to  Sonic Team) decided that the game should be fast, but simple to control. Many design ideas were tossed around - a bulldog, a rabbit that picked objects up with his ears - but the decision came down to the act of the character rolling in to a ball and down hills to gain speed. It eventually came down to a hedgehog or an  armadillo - and in the end, the hedgehog won out. Initially called \"Mr. Needlemouse\", he was brought to Sega of America's marketing teams for further refinement.Very early concept art by Naoto Oshima.[CR]\"Mr. Needlemouse\" was originally the hard-edged lead singer in a rock and roll band, tasked with rescuing a groupie named Madonna, a human female who was apparently in love with the Hedgehog. Madonna was to be captured by \"Dr. Badvibes\", leading to our hero to leap in to action. Sega of America requested a number of changes, including tweaks to Mr. Needlemouse's look to soften up his thuggish appearance, the removal of the \"rock band\" aspect, and a name change to Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Sonic was originally a light shade of blue, however testers had a difficult time telling Sonic apart from the blue sky. One of the last changes made to the game before being shipped was to change Sonic's palette to a much darker shade of cobalt in order to make him stand out better.Though the concept of a Rabbit that picks up and throws objects with his ears was rejected for Sonic, the concept was revisited by Sonic Team and eventually became  Ristar: The Shooting Star.The Armadillo concept also resurfaced later in  SegaSonic the Hedgehog for Arcades and  Knuckles Chaotix on the 32X, as the character  Mighty The Armadillo.The \"Sonic the Hedgehog Rock & Roll Band\" concept was initially supposed to be kept for the game's fully-featured sound test mode, where Sonic and crew would play their instruments along with the game's soundtrack. This animation had to be removed in order to make room for the iconic \"SEGA!\" voice chime when the game first starts up, which Yuji Naka reportedly felt was a more impressive technological feat.Everybody has been \"in a band\" at some point in their life - even Sonic.Members of Sonic the Hedgehog's long lost Band include Sharps the Chicken on lead Guitar, Mach the Rabbit on Drums, Max the Monkey on Bass, and  Vector the Crocodile on Keyboards. Vector the Crocodile would return as a character in  Knuckles Chaotix, and later became a staple of the Sonic roster with games like  Sonic Heroes and  Shadow the Hedgehog.The Game Gear/Master System version of Sonic the Hedgehog still features an animated image of Sonic standing at a microphone for its Sound Test.Much of this game's art style was inspired by early 3D Graphics work. In the  Sonic Jam Official Japanese Strategy Guide (written personally by Sonic Team), Yuji Naka recalls that the team had a difficult time recreating the angular, vectorized 3D graphics visual style using hand-drawn pixel artwork.According to designer Naoto Oshima in an interview with  Gametap, Sonic the Hedgehog's design was inspired by  Michael Jackson's cool sense of style and  Bill Clinton's no-nonsense, \"Get it Done\" attitude. The color scheme for Sonic's trademark shoes were apparently inspired by Santa Claus' red/white motif.In one of the first Japanese television commercials for this game, Sonic is shown to pilot a space ship where he drops a bomb on to what appears to be a parody of the Death Star, remade to look like Dr. Eggman's face. This concept was later re-used for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, where Dr. Eggman builds a nearly identical looking space station called the Death Egg.[CR]World Records[CR] Twin Galaxies is the world authority on video game world records and below are the variations/records tracked for Sonic the Hedgehog.812,140 [Tournament Settings, 5 Lives Only] by Michael Sroka38min. 12sec. [Minimalist Speed Run] by Jared Oswald1hr 3min 7sec [Fastest Full Completion, All Emeralds] by Jared Oswald[CR]SEGA Master System and Game Gear version[CR][B]Overview:[/B] and differencesMaster System Box Art[CR]Sonic The Hedgehog on the  Master System is similar to the Mega Drive/  Genesis version in some respects, but is overall a very different game.Unlike the 16-bit version Sonic cannot recollect rings after being damaged by an enemy.The Chaos Emeralds appear in the levels as opposed to appearing in the Special Stages which only contain rings.With the exception of Scrap Brain Zone (Act 3) no boss zones contain rings or  Badniks. This made the  boss fights much more difficult than they were on the 16-bit version of the game.The  Game Gear version features sign posts warning the player of upcoming  spike pits. This is because the Game Gear screen was much smaller and narrower than a TV screen, making the game slightly harder.[CR]There is one Continue hidden in each of the eight Special Stages, unlike the 16-bit version where gaining a Continue was based on the player's ring count.Levels[CR]Each level (also known as Zones or Rounds according to the back of the game box) are made up of three acts. The third act in each zone contains that zones boss which is always Dr. Robotnik in different machine. In addition to these levels there are eight Special Stages. These can be accessed by beating any of the first two acts of a level with 50 or more rings.[CR]Zones in play though order:Green Hill ZoneBridge ZoneJungle ZoneLabyrinth ZoneScrap Brain ZoneSky Base ZoneVaried level designs[CR]Sonic The Hedgehog on the Master System/Game Gear contains two zones that contain unique design elements for the series.[CR]The first one is Bridge Zone (Act 2) which features a  scrolling screen that moves independently of the player. This effectively forces the player to keep moving until the end of the zone, but also means that the player cannot speed through the zone in true Sonic style. The other unique zone is Jungle Zone (Act 2), which features a  vertical design rather than the traditional horizontal layout. The screen adjusts as Sonic moves up the zone but it does not go back down, so touching the bottom of the screen results in  instant death.[CR]Updated Releases[CR]GBA Release[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog was ported to the  Game Boy Advance in 2006. This iteration of the game features the same 6 zones, as well an added spin-dash move and a save feature. The graphics are not down scaled in any way, and look the same as the original Genesis version. This GBA port of Sonic the Hedgehog is considered to be very broken and inaccurately recreates the Genesis title, with choppy frame rate issues and graphical and collision errors.iPhone ReleaseThe iOS version of the game can be played using either touch controls or the accelerometer[CR]A port of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game was released onto the iPhone on May 20, 2009 by Sega America. The port features all of the original graphics and sounds and originally sold for $5.99 USD on Apple 's App Store. The controls for the iPhone version use a virtual D-Pad along with a virtual \"A\" Button. The iPhone and iPod Touch versions of Sonic the Hedgehog feature 7 different zones to play through. There are also two ways to display the game: Full Screen or \"Arcade\" mode.[CR]This version of the game was eventually updated and released as an iPad app as well.Android Release[CR]On May 16, 2013 the game was released to the Android platform, costing $2.99/\u00a31.99/\u20ac2.69/AUD$2.99, the same as the iOS version at the time of release. This version of the game was updated for Google\u2019s mobile operating system with widescreen support and a 60 fps frame rate, as well as a remastered soundtrack, leaderboards and achievements. This update also allows players to unlock Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.[CR]SEGA also announced that the updates this iteration of the game debuted would be released to the iOS version of the game under the form of an update. An update released on May 16th in the US App Store, and on May 15th in certain international App Stores, read as follows:[CR]- Enhanced graphics, performance, and sound![CR]- New unlockable characters![CR]**Note: This is an all-new port of Sonic The Hedgehog! Unfortunately, saves from previous versions are incompatible with version 2.0!**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Config Mode[CR]There is a code called control mode, which is required before activating this code. [CR]To activate control mode, press UP, C, DOWN, C, LEFT, C, RIGHT, C at the title screen, but before pressing start to begin the game, press and hold A as you hit start. Now, rather than just being in control mode, you can enable config mode by pressing button B.

[CR]You can change the item Sonic appears as by hitting A while in config mode. Button B makes Sonic normal again, and button C will place the sprite that you have selected for Sonic to appear as. For example, you press B, and Sonic becomes a ring, press C to make a ring appear exactly where the ring icon is. [CR]WARNING!: This will distort several different things, such as the score, time, and other various icons throughout the game such as the finish sign at the end of the first two acts of each zone that spins when Sonic shoots past them, and the small score icons that appear whenever Sonic jumps high enough after finishing a level. That is all I have noticed in my time playing the game, but there could be more out there yet. The game is still quite playable this way, so it should not hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Config Mode[CR][I]Note: This code is for the Japanese version.[/I][CR]At the title screen, press Up, C, Down, C, Down, C, Down, C, Left, C, Right.

Sonic 2 is very similar to the original, but builds on many of the concepts and ideas introduced in the first title while piling on nearly twice the number of levels. The most drastic change was the introduction of a sidekick, Miles \"Tails\" Prower. The new character allowed a simple 2-player competitive mode, borrowing levels from the single player to add a much needed multi-player component. Tails could also follow Sonic around in single player mode, and could be controlled by plugging in a second Genesis gamepad.Sonic gets a sidekick.[CR]Arguably the most dramatic improvement is the implementation of the Spin-dash. By ducking and pressing the jump button, Sonic would rev up in ball form. After revving up enough, the player could stop pressing down to get a burst of speed while staying rolled into a ball. Beyond those two additions, however, gameplay for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remains relatively the same; the goal is still to get to the end of a level as quickly as possible, while destroying as many enemies and collecting as many rings as possible. Rather than having three acts and a boss fight (as in Sonic 1), Sonic 2 features only two acts per level, with some exceptions (Metropolis Zone features three acts, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg all feature a single act each).[CR]Chaos Emeralds also returned from the original, offering up an additional 7th Emerald (instead of the original game's 6). The special stages were done on a endless half-pipe which Sonic ran forward on collecting rings and avoiding enemies. If he had enough rings when he hit the checkpoint then he would continue until eventually obtaining a Chaos Emerald. Collect all 7 and Sonic would be able to transform into Super Sonic. In this form Sonic becomes even faster and rather than his usual blue is colored a bright yellow.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Not content just exploring his home of South Island, Sonic the Hedgehog's adventures took him all over the globe. It was eventually he found himself at West-side Island, said to be home to a lost civilization. This civilization were given seven \"Chaos Emeralds\" of great power as a gift from the Gods. Eventually, this power corrupted the civilization, and this angered the Gods greatly. As punishment, they sealed the emeralds away in an alternate dimension called \"The Special Zone\".Sonic apparently didn't read the in-flight safety booklet.[CR]Intrigued, Sonic lands his biplane, the Tornado, on the island. It's here Sonic runs in to a shy, two-tailed fox named Miles - Sonic nicknames him \"Tails\" for obvious reasons. Tails, as it turns out, loves machinery, and he is fascinated by Sonic's plane. Before the two can get too acquainted, however, they hear an explosion in the distance. Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik has followed Sonic to this island, and is tearing it apart looking for the Chaos Emeralds. He hopes they will act as an energy source for his greatest, most deadly creation: a giant, weaponized space station called the \"Death Egg.\" Together, Sonic and Tails agree that Robotnik has to be stopped at all costs.[CR]Special Stage[CR]The Special Stage is played from behind Sonic in a 3D half-pipe. The player is given a target of the number of rings they have to collect as Sonic runs through the pipe whist avoiding the bombs. If the target is met then the stage continues, if not then the player returns to the level where they entered the Special Stage with a total of no rings. By meeting all the targets in the Special Stage, the stage is cleared and the player unlocks a Chaos Emerald. Each new Special Stage is harder than the one which preceded it and they have to be completed in order with no way to skip to the next one without completing the one previous.Tony Hawk ain't got nothin' on Sonic.[CR]After collecting all 7 Chaos Emeralds, compared to the total of 6 found in the Master System version, Sonic gains the ability to change into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings. When Sonic becomes his super form he is virtually invincible, running and jumping much higher than normal, only able to be killed by drowning, being crushed, falling off the screen or by running out of time in the level. This added speed comes at a price as it makes it almost impossible to do precise jumps due to the increased speed as well as loosing 1 ring a second whilst in super form; with Sonic reverting back to his normal self when the rings reach zero and effectively making him a sitting duck to enemies.[CR]Two Player Versus Mode[CR]Sonic 2 also included a two versus player mode where, playing as either Sonic or Tails, two players can have a split screen race on one of 3 different zones or a Special Stage. In the regular zone races, on either Emerald Hill Zone, Casino Night Zone or Mystic Cave Zone, players are ranked in 5 different areas with the highest score winning the round. On the Special Stage the winner is the one who collects the most rings. In the case of a tie in the regular zones a Special Stage is then ran to determine a winner. Two player mode also added a couple of new item boxes. One being a teleporter which switched the two players around, the other being a Dr. Robotnik item which damaged the player that found it.[CR]Compatibility with Sonic & Knuckles[CR]Sonic 2 & Knuckles![CR]By slotting the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cart into the top of the Sonic & Knuckles Lock-on featured cart the player could play as Knuckles in Sonic 2. The game is essentially exactly the same with the player playing as Knuckles instead of either Sonic or Tails. He can glide and climb walls but due to his inferior jumping ability some boss fights are more difficult as Knuckles. There are a few minor differences in the way Star Post checkpoints are handled however as when returning to a level after a Special Stage the player would keep the rings they had before they went in, whereas in the default game all rings were lost. The same applies when a life is lost.Re-releases[CR]The Genesis version of this game was re-released on:Sonic Compilation on the Mega Drive in EuropeSonic 3-in-1 on the Genesis in North AmericaSega Smash Pack 2 on the PCReal Arcade on the PCSonic Mega Collection on the Nintendo GamecubeSonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2, Xbox and PCSonic Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSPWii Virtual ConsoleXbox Live Arcade MarketplaceSonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3[CR]Numerous mobile phone versions also exist.[CR]Zones[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 11 zones, plus one special stage. This is twice as many as the original Sonic, which had 6 zones. However, a big difference this time around is that most of the zones have two acts instead of three. This is not a hard and fast rule though, as the Metropolis Zone had 3 acts and both the Death Egg Zone and the Wing Fortress zones had only one.Emerald Hill ZoneThe Emerald Hill Zone[CR]This zone is similar to the Green Hill Zone of the previous Sonic game. It\u2019s set in a tropical resort that features many trees, green hills and wildlife-themed enemies. Dr. Robotnik appears here in a vehicle with a giant mechanical drill attached to the front. He travels back and forth in an attempt to impale the player, and due to this simplistic process, he is therefore relatively easy to defeat.Chemical Plant ZoneThe Chemical Plant Zone[CR]This zone is set in a bustling industrial city that is flooded with a neon pink liquid, Sonic can survive while submerged in this, but only for a limited time since there are no air bubbles. Dr. Robotnik makes his appearance with a suction tube clipped onto the bottom of his ship, which he uses to extract toxic materials from the liquid below, which he will then attempt to drop on the player. The player must attempt to avoid these attacks while remaining on the platform, which features panels that will successively rotate.Aquatic Ruin ZoneThe Aquatic Ruin Zone[CR]This zone is set in the half-submerged, swampy remains of a crumbling ruin. Players who fall into the water will find that they have a harder time than those who were skillful enough to stay dry, as the underwater path is significantly harder than the land path. Robotnik appears here with a giant mallet attached to his ship, he will hit down on two columns that flank the player on either side of street, causing them to shoot out arrows. The player must use these arrows as platforms in order to be able to reach Robotnik and bring him down.Casino Night ZoneThe Casino Night Zone[CR]This zone is reminiscent of the Spring Yard Zone of Sonic 1, in that it is set up to be a giant casino themed pinball table. Of course, this means the player must try and get past obstacles such as bumpers and slot machines in their attempt to reach Dr. Robotnik. He appears here at the bottom of a pinball table, with a set of electric pincers on the bottom of his ship. He uses this to drop bombs on the player, so staying on the ground is inadvisable. Instead, the player must spin dash up to, and utilize, the bumpers in order to hurl themselves at Robotnik.Hill Top ZoneThe Hill Top Zone[CR]This zone is set just above the clouds, on top of a set of hills. Sonic must cross over the top of the hills, and then delve down into it to face pools of magma and earthquakes, which makes the floor rise from under him. Here, the doctor emerges from the lava in a heat proof submarine with a flamethrower attached on top. He will repeatedly emerge from the lava and attempt to shoot the player with flames, which also sets the ground on fire. The player must strike out at Robotnik once he emerges from the lava, while avoiding the jet stream of flames.Mystic Cave ZoneThe Mystic Cave Zone[CR]This underground zone is set in a deep cave, which is covered in crystals. Sonic must swing from vines and avoid being crushed by crystals while they progress on their way to Dr. Robotnik. If the player manages to get through this stage, they are greeted at the end by Robotnik, who has a pair of drills attached on either side of ship. He uses these to drill into the ceiling and create sharp debris that will fall on the player if they\u2019re not careful.Oil Ocean ZoneThe Oil Ocean Zone[CR]This zone is a giant oil refinery which features pools of thick oil that that the player can skim across. The oil is a double-edged sword, however, as while players can use it, if they are not careful they can sink into it and lose a life. Robotnik appears here in a submarine similar to the one he uses in the Hill Top Zone, but instead of a flamethrower, he now has a laser cannon that is much more lethal. Another new tactic he uses is that when submerged, he will send out a claw that travels over one of the platforms on the screen.Metropolis ZoneThe Metropolis Zone[CR]This is the only stage in the game to contain three distinct acts. This massive, construction themed, zone features corkscrews, copious spikes, magma and, of course, industrial themed moving platforms. After players make the lengthy excursion to the end of act three, they will predictably find Dr. Robotnik there. This time, he is surrounded by seven shaped pods, which rotate around him, creating a protective shield. Every time the player hits Robotnik, one of the pods will break off and transform into an inflatable copy of him, but these don\u2019t pose a problem as they can be destroyed with a single hit. After all the pods have been destroyed, Robotnik will strafe across the screen with a laser beam. He is vulnerable in this state, however, as one more hit will send him packing.Sky Chase ZoneThe Sky Chase Zone[CR]This one act zone is set in the sky, as Sonic rides on top of Tail\u2019s plane, the Tornado. Throughout the stage, Sonic\u2019s partner will remain under Sonic wherever he goes, so falling isn\u2019t a problem here. The player comes up against a variety of aerial themed enemies, but when they get to the end they will find that there is no boss in this stage.Wing Fortress ZoneThe Wing Fortress Zone[CR]Tails' plane, the Tornado, takes a hit and begins to fall to the ground. Sonic bails out and lands on Robotnik\u2019s Wing Fortress. This flying citadel has many different traps and enemies, but the biggest threat to the player is falling off the screen, as this can be done a little too easily. Here, Robotnik has built a contraption to do the fighting for him. He locks Sonic within an energy field, and along with Sonic there is a laser cannon which strafes to and fro across the top of the screen, attempting to periodically fry the player. Along with the cannon, there are three flying spike platforms that bounce off the walls. The player must use these as a platform in order to reach and damage the sensitive cannon, while avoid their spiked sides.Death Egg ZoneMecha Sonic's first appearance, in the last stage of Sonic 2[CR]After the fight in the Wing Fortress Zone, Sonic chases Dr. Robotnik into the Death Egg. This, ringless, zone consists of two separate bosses. The first is Mecha Sonic, this doppelganger has some of Sonic\u2019s moves, as he jumps and spin dashes across the stage. The player must hit him in the head while he stands still in order to damage him.The Final Boss, Dr. Robotnik[CR]After a few hits, Mecha Sonic goes down, and Sonic progresses into the next room for his final confrontation with Dr. Robotnik. The giant robot he appears in lumbers slowly around the arena, but the lower half of said monstrosity is invulnerable. The only way the player can reach the breakable upper half is to wait for the right moment. After trudging around for a bit, Robotnik rockets off the top of the screen, causing a target to appear over Sonic. When the target begins flashing, the giant egg bot is about to come crashing down. Immediately after landing, the machine lurches forward presenting the only safe opportunity to attack. But the player has to be careful as every other fall, he'll fire off his spiked arms which are near impossible to avoid unless Sonic is out of reach. After twelve hits Robotnik will go down, and the ending of the game begins.Hidden Palace ZoneHidden Palace Zone[CR]By using a Game Genie, it is in fact possible to get into the Hidden Palace Zone in the retail version on Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The code to unlock it is ACLA-ATD4 and then going into level select and pressing A and Start together when highlighting the Death Egg Zone. The level is obviously unfinished and cannot be completed without creating the Egg Prison item in debug mode. Bits of the level design seen in the numerous Beta versions of the game are still there including the infamous 'Master Emerald' block. All level art seen in previous Betas have been deleted presumably to save cartridge space and most of the textures as a result are just a glitched mess. In the background however, art from the Oil Ocean Zone can be seen. In the 2013 iOS and Android release of the game, this level was finally added into the game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2's soundtrack was composed by returning musician Masato Nakamura, bass guitarist for Japanese Pop-music band Dreams Come True. The song that plays after Sonic defeats the final boss (but before the credits roll) is in fact a karaoke version of a Dreams Come True song known as \"Sweet Sweet Sweet\" (or, as its known in America, \"Sweet Dream\"), from their triple-platinum album \"The Swinging Star.\"[CR]Development History[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 nearly did not happen. After completing Sonic the Hedgehog, Yuji Naka resigned from Sega of Japan. Sega of Japan paid its employees based purely on how long they had been employed at the company, and given that Yuji Naka was still relatively new, he was not being paid very much, despite having worked on one of the most prominent titles for the company. He was lured to America by Mark Cerny, who worked for the Sega Technical Institute (STI). STI was formed to help bridge the gap between the relatively new American game developers and the seasoned Japanese game developers. Yuji Naka and most of SonicTeam agreed to take part in this, and officially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was started at STI, featuring a mixture of Japanese and American developers and designers.[CR]Like the original Sonic the Hedgehog, a Character Design contest was held, this time to give Sonic a sidekick. The winner was Yasushi Yamaguchi's \"Miles Prower\" design. However, most of the team agreed that the character should be renamed to \"Tails\". Yasushi fought hard to keep the name as \"Miles\", even going so far as to make sure in-game art assets all read \"Miles\" instead of \"Tails\". Eventually, the team decided on a compromise - though the character's full name would be \"Miles Prower\", most people would call him \"Tails\" as a nickname.[CR]Initially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was planned for the Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear (which was also ported to the Master System), and an enhanced port to the Sega CD. All versions of the game were slated to feature Time Travel in some capacity. As the projects went on, however, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD began to drift rather heavily from its Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear counterparts. Eventually, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD was re-named altogether to become its own separate Sonic game, titled Sonic CD and Sonic 2 for the Sega Genesis dropped the Time Travel gimmick. Sonic 2 on the Game Gear existed as sort of a middle ground in between it all; it features remixes of music from the Japanese version of Sonic CD, and a plot where Tails gets kidnapped (instead of Sonic CD's Amy Rose). Unused footage for a Sonic CD video sequence gives a brief look at an Antlion Robot very similar to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Game Gear.[CR]8-bit Master System/Game Gear Game[CR]Master System Box Shot[CR]A month before the release of the 16-bit Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Mega Drive/Genesis on October 29, 1992, an 8-bit game called Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released for the Sega Master System on October 16, 1992. It was released exclusively for PAL territories, such as Europe and South America, regions where the Master System was popular. It was followed by a port to the Sega Game Gear handheld, in PAL regions on October 29, 1992, followed by a North American release in November 1992.[CR]Sega outsourced its development to Aspect, another Japanese company, which created a very different game from similar concepts.[CR]Being released before the 16-bit version for the Mega Drive/Genesis, the 8-bit editions of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 represented the debut of character Miles \"Tails\" Prower, who became a recurring character in the series.[CR]The Master System version was released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console on November 18, 2008 in Japan, in North America on December 8, 2008and in the PAL regions on December 26, 2008.Storyline[CR]Tails has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Robotnik. In order to guarantee his safe return, Sonic must stop Dr. Robotnik, thwart his evil plans, rescue Tails and retrieve the 6 Chaos Emeralds.Synopsis[CR]South Island has been peaceful since Dr. Robotnik's defeat. Sonic, bored, decides to go on a journey in search of other adventures. Upon his return, he is shocked to find the island nearly abandoned. The only clue as to where all his friends might have disappeared to is a single note, written by his two-tailed fox buddy, Miles \"Tails\" Prower. In the note, Tails explains that he's been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik and is being held in a place called Crystal Egg. The price for Tails' safe return are the 6 Chaos Emeralds, to be delivered to 6 new boss robots. Thus, Sonic goes on a quest to find the Chaos Emeralds and rescue Tails.Gameplay[CR]The gameplay of Sonic 2 on the Master System/Game Gear was very different to the Genesis version. However, it was greatly updated in comparison to the original Sonic game also released on the Master System.[CR]It featured the ability to collect back up rings that Sonic had dropped when he was hit by an enemy as well as being able to smash through some walls by running into them. The game also featured levels where Sonic was required to ride along in a mine cart or fly a hand-glider. There was also a large bubble in the underwater levels which would allow Sonic to float upwards till he hit the ceiling or an enemy as well as the ability for Sonic to run on water provided he had enough speed; a feature absent from the 16-bit Genesis version of Sonic 2 but later implemented in Sonic 3.[CR]There were 7 zones in the game in total, each made of 3 Acts, with a prize panel being spun at the end of Acts 1 and 2 in which Sonic could earn an extra life. a continue, plus 10 rings or nothing, depending on which picture it landed on. Act 3 is the zones end level boss where Sonic must usually defeat a variety of robotic animals in order to proceed to the next zone.[CR]If the player manages to collect 5 Chaos Emeralds as they progress through the game, when they Mecha Sonic and defeat him they will be given the 6th Emerald and go on to fight Dr. Robotnik in Act 3 of the next and final zone, the Crystal Egg Zone. Defeating Dr. Robotnik here will unlock the \"Good Ending\". Failure to collect all 5 Chaos Emeralds before the encounter with Mecha Sonic will result in the game ending after his destruction and the player receiving the \"Bad Ending\" in which it is assumed that Dr. Robotnik has killed Sonic's friend Tails.Development[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 received preview coverage in the October 1992 issue of GamePro.[CR]The Game Gear's lower screen resolution results in the Game Gear version having a smaller visible screen area than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced screen area either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle takes place in a smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage. The music for the intro sequence is also different. The Game Gear version uses the Scrambled Egg Zone music for the scene showing Robotnik escaping with the captive Tails and the Master System intro music for the title. The boss music is also different between the two versions. The Master System version used a single theme for the endings while a new good ending theme was added for the Game Gear version.[CR]The Game Gear version also features dark blue (instead of green) water in the second Act of the Aqua Lake Zone, and omits the game's only \"Speed Shoes\" item box, which may be found only in the Master System version of this stage. In the Game Gear version in power-up's original location is a Ring item box instead, thus rendering the item unused in said port.Soundtrack[CR]The music for Green Hills Zone was later used as the theme song for the Japanese and European versions of Sonic the Hedgehog CD, where it is called \"Sonic: You Can Do Anything\". A remix of the tune is also used for Mecha Green Hill Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos.Re-releases[CR]The Sega Master System/Game Gear game was re-released on:Sonic Mega Collection (2002) (GameCube, PS2, Xbox, PC)Sonic Adventure DX (2003) (GameCube, PC)Sonic Gems Collection (2005) (GameCube, PS2)[CR]The game was later re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service, with the Master System version released for the Wii Virtual Console in December 2008 and the Game Gear version released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in June 2013.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The design for The Death Egg in this game most likely came from a Japanese TV commercial for the original Sonic the Hedgehog, wherein Sonic pilots a space ship to destroy a massive space station similar to Star Wars' own Death Star, but modified to look like Dr. Eggman's face.Early beta versions of the game reveal that, at one point, even more levels were planned for Sonic 2, including Wood Zone, a stage set in leafy tree tops, and Dust Hill Zone, a western-themed stage full of cacti and desert-dwelling robots. Hidden Palace Zone, not to be confused with the Sonic & Knuckles stage of the same name, also exists in the beta version, along side an unplayable entry for a \"Genocide City Zone\". The stage \"Neo Green Hill Zone\" also exists, though selecting it from a stage-select menu takes Sonic to Aquatic Ruin Zone, possibly suggesting it originally went by a different name earlier in development.Interviews with various Sonic 2 graphics and level designers reveal even more cut levels never seen publicly: A recolored version of Dust Hill Zone to transform the sand in to snow, a Rock Zone, and a level called Cyber City Zone, possibly another name for Genocide City Zone. Genocide/Cyber City was supposed to take place between Metropolis Zone and Sky Chase, but time ran out - what work was completed on Genocide/Cyber City became Metropolis Zone Act 3.Level layouts from the cut level Wood Zone match up with level layouts for Metropolis Zone, possibly hinting at Sonic 2's now lost time travel feature. This suggests that Wood Zone would have possibly been what Metropolis Zone looked like in the distant past.Many of the resources made for deleted Sonic 2 levels eventually made it in to Sonic Spinball, another Sega Technical Institute game. Tiles for Hidden Palace Zone can be seen in the background for Toxic Caves, and graphics for a level called \"The Machine\" match up with concept art drawn for Cyber City Zone.Furthering the lost connection between Sonic 2 and Sonic CD, artwork of Sonic CD's \"Little Planet\" showcases areas on the planet that represent all levels present in the game, save for the top-right corner of the planet: A desert region, covered in cactus, reminiscent of this game's Dust Hill Zone.By collecting all seven chaos emeralds and fifty rings in a level, Sonic can transform in to the invincible Super Sonic form. Super Sonic is a bright golden yellow color with up-turned spikes, an obvious reference to Dragon Ball Z's Super Saiyan form. Yuji Naka was reportedly a big fan of Dragon Ball, and during his stay in America, had VHS tapes the latest episodes shipped to him weekly from overseas.Foxes, in Japanese folklore, are mischievous mythological beings sometimes refered to as a \"Kitsune\" (pronounced \"Kit-Sue-Ney\"). As a Kitsune ages, it grows additional tails, up to a maximum of nine. Additional tails on a Kitsune represent the level of mystical energy and intelligence within the being. Some stories say that a Kitsune will only grow a new tail every 1,000 years. A Kitsune with 9 tails is said to have infinite wisdom, and usually has fur that appears golden in color.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Debug[CR]Enter at soundtest ''19, 65, 09, 17'', then press A + start, then when sonic and tails pop up, press A + Start to go to the level select screen.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1987 on the NEC PC-8801 and NEC PC-9801 computers in Japan, Sorcerian was developed by Nihon Falcom and is the fifth numbered game in the Dragon Slayer series. It was later released for MS-DOS in English-speaking countries through publisher Sierra Entertainment in 1990.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a side scrolling action RPG, featuring customizable characters organized into a four person party. The player can create up to 20 male and female characters from among 4 character classes.[CR]The game features an open-ended, persistent world. Time passes in the game world, with characters growing, ageing, and eventually dying of old age.[CR]The content draws from the high fantasy tradition, and features elves, dwarves, and the like. The game is organized into 15 quests, or levels, which the player can approach through any order of their choice (\u00e0 la Mega Man). In turn, these quests are part of three distinct storylines, which can be played and completed in any order. The modular quest structure allows the player to leave and return to quests at any time, and play through them again at will.[CR]The game's magic system is unique and complex, requiring the combination of spells to create more powerful spells, and combining items to concoct more effective items and potions.[CR]The game features a construction kit, to add user-generated scenarios to the game, a concept influenced by Kaleidoscope. As a result, three expansions were released for Sorcerian by different developers, each expanding the original quest selection.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The game is also remembered for including music composed by Yuzo Koshiro, along with contributions from Mieko Ishikawa and Takahito Abe. Koshiro would later go on to work on the music for the Streets of Rage series.[CR]The soundtrack has been released in a variety of formats, at least five times.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]When it released in the North American market, Computer Gaming World magazine praised the unique multi-scenario system, which broke the game down into smaller quests played in any order rather than a single linear epic adventure, giving the game more variety. On the other hand, it criticized the game's unique but complex magic system, for being difficult and time-consuming. It also praised the use of puzzles to add variety to the arcade-style hack & slash combat, but noted that the Japanese-style action-based combat may turn off some fans of more traditional American-style turn-based combat.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In 2008, Platinum Games designer Hideki Kamiya listed Sorcerian as one of his favourite games of all time and an influence on his work. Later in 2014, he mentioned it as an influence on Scalebound. He stated, \"It's a standard fantasy title with swords, magic and gigantic monsters,\" where \"You can choose from 15 different scenarios in all, and if you buy the separately sold scenario set, you can play even more new adventures. This game was really full of expansive possibilities.\" He stated \"a hydra boss appears in the first scenario, so that might be why a hydra appeared in the Scalebound promotion video.\"[CR]",

The first 12 stages have a similar structure of sending a set number of enemy waves at the player and then ending it with a unique boss fight. The thirteenth stage, however, changes the formula. In this stage, the player must fight all twelve bosses in succession. Once the player manages to get past this stage, the fourteenth stage is the final battle with the Dark Harrier. Once the Dark Harrier is defeated, the game ends and player is given a text based epilogue saying that the good deed is done while also implying that the game can be played again because evil never sleeps.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Options/Sound Test[CR]Wait for the title screen to appear, then press [B]Up, Down, Left, RIght, A[/B].",

The interactive introduction scene shows Sparkster picking up a new sword after the final fight when his nemesis Axel Gear appears, the rocket knight gone evil. After a fight in giant robots, Sparkster manages to save Princess Cherry and returns her to the queen. Then suddenly Axel appears again and he kidnaps her. It turns out Axel is working once more for the Empire of Gedol. Sparkster has to return the peace in Kingdom of Zebulos, save the princess and bring an end to the evil empire.[CR]The game consists of six levels with 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The opossum Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with his sword. Using his rocket pack, he can also perform stronger attacks and burst through the air in different directions. The rocket power consists of a double meter that refills gradually, making it possible to perform successive attacks in the air, ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows for the strongest attacks, but fills more slowly. Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore health and different types of power-ups for his sword. Most levels have typical platform gameplay, but there is also a level where Sparkster walks around in a giant robot, knocking enemies out of the air.[CR]For an additional challenge players can locate the seven swords hidden throughout the levels. When all of them have been found, the hero turns into Golden Sparkster. The game includes a password system.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords at the password screen:",

Oh yeah, and before you get too comfortable - Axel Gear is here. This Rocket-Knight-gone-bad has a score to settle with Sparkster. Our hero will need his revved-up new rocket pack and powerful new attack moves to kick Axel's tail back to the dark side of the planet.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Sparkster's gameplay is very similar to its precursor. The game largely functions as a 2D sidescrolling platformer, with an autoscrolling airship stage being the lone exception. The player is able to jump, attack with Sparkster's sword, or use his rocket pack to fly.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.[CR]Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.[CR]Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp Gates[CR]There are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.[CR]Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.[CR]Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.[CR]Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.[CR]In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.[CR]In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.[CR]At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like Nigel, Graham and Barry. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like Gaza, Roscopp and Jams to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.[CR]The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.[CR]Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage is the video game adaptation of the comic book arc of the same name. In this brawler the player controls Spider-Man or Venom as they join forces against the psychopathic Carnage.[CR]The game structure is divided by stages and each stage may be side or top-down scroller. For the majority of them, the player can move the character on a Z-Axis, as seen with classic games like Golden Axe or Final Fight.[CR]The gameplay involves a lot of button mashing for getting combos and sending the enemies to the void. There's no character upgrades nor is there any level progression.[CR]The story is told mainly by comic book style cutscenes between stages, that brings to the player the original comic art with some minor animations.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens in Ravencroft Asylum, where Cletus Kasady -- a maniacal killer who carries \"Carnage\", a spawn of the Venom symbiote -- is being escorted to a cell. The Carnage symbiote emerges during the escort, and, after gaining control of Kasady, kills all of the guards in the complex. Carnage meets Shriek, a woman with the ability to manipulate sound into concussive blasts, and they gather a \"family\" of villains -- including Doppelganger (a six-armed Spider-Man look-alike whose mask is adorned with gruesome teeth and whose web is made of barbed wire), Demogoblin (a demon that bears likeness to the Hobgoblin), and Carrion (a man infected with a virus that grants him the ability to turn organic matter into ash). With their group assembled, the \"family\" begins a killing spree in New York, the likes of which have never been seen.[CR]Spider-Man, seeing the effect Carnage's crusade is having on the thug community of New York, tries to stop the riots in the streets with a hands-on approach that, after a confrontation with Shriek and Doppelganger, nearly kills him. Cloak and Dagger intervene before a vicious gang step in with the killing stroke, and Cloak teleports Spider-Man to a nearby church. Having followed Spider-Man to his temporary resting place, Shriek and Doppelganger attack the trio of heroes, and though they fight valiantly, Carnage announces his presence with authority by stabbing Dagger. Content with the chaos he's created, Carnage leaves the church with his compatriots.[CR]Eddie Brock, the man carrying the \"Venom\" symbiote, sees the reports of Carnage's rampage in the newspaper the following morning. His anger wells, and Venom imposes itself quickly over Brock's will. Venom devotes himself to reaching New York before Carnage destroys more lives.[CR]Venom arrives in New York to confront Carnage, who is both surprised and quite pleased his symbiotic counterpart has come to join the chaos, but Carnage commits both Shriek and Doppelganger to stop Venom. A brutal battle wages between the three warriors, and Venom's might is admirable, but the combined power of the \"family\" proves greater than the resolve of the elder symbiote. Knowing defeat, Venom escapes with his life and plants his broken body on the doorstep of Peter Parker.[CR]Carnage allows Demogoblin to begin his assault on Manhattan, and Spider-Man, understanding the gravity of the situation, takes an oath to align himself with Venom in order to stop Kasady's madness. Venom takes on Demogoblin, while Spider-Man fights his way through waves of gang members to reach Carnage's ad hoc headquarters -- a nightclub called \"The Deep\". Spider-Man's newfound rage leads him through a gauntlet battle against the bulk of Carnage's crew, but when the \"family\" manages to escape, it becomes duly apparent that a new plan is necessary to unbalance and overthrow Carnage's reign over the fear of the city.[CR]Venom suggests Carnage, despite his heightened strengths, may still be vulnerable to the same weaknesses against which Venom falters. Spider-Man decides to infiltrate the laboratory of Reed Richards to obtain the Fantastic Four's Sonic Gun, as the symbiote only appears weak to sonic sound waves and fire.[CR]After obtaining Richards's sonic gun, the group of heroes (now aided by fire-manipulating Firestar) manage to lure Carnage and his troops to Prospect Park, where a heated battle erupts between all of the heroes. The conflict culminates with the heroes seemingly victorious, and Firestar uses a plume of flames to end Carnage's reign forever. Spider-Man, however, refuses to bring himself to the level of a maniac like Kasady, and orders Firestar to stop before Kasady dies along with the symbiote. Venom grows angry at Spider-Man's empathy and self-righteousness, and provokes Parker into a brawl that escalates into Venom knocking Spider-Man down a steep hill and proclaiming his unending hate for the webslinger. The heroes rush to Spider-Man's aid, leaving Venom alone with Carnage and Shriek, who regain their energy and overwhelm Venom, whisking him away with the Sonic Gun in-hand.[CR]Holding Venom hostage in the Statue of Liberty, Carnage tortures him by holding him above a fire, and shooting him with intermittent blasts from the Sonic Gun, allowing the symbiote to neither dissipate completely nor fully regain its vigor. Spider-Man and ever-increasing cascade of heroes (Captain America now joins the group) continue their push against the \"family,\" but Venom manages to free himself, willing the symbiote to bat the Sonic Gun out of Carnage's hand and escape from the Statue of Liberty. He meets with Spider-Man in the now-riotous streets of Manhattan for a final clash against Shriek and the minions, and they overcome both the \"family\" and Carnage when he arrives in pursuit of Venom.[CR]Comfortable that Carnage has been dealt with, Spider-Man and Venom have a last interchange in Central Park. Peace washes over New York as the sun rises over the horizon and a serene silence signifies the end of the reign of terror. As the two unlikely heroes begin to part ways, Carnage arises -- nearly completely regenerated -- from the nearby lake to do battle once more. Fearing the conflict has no end, Spider-Man grows weary and edges near defeat, yet the Avengers arrive as Carnage is dealt a final, crushing blow, and it seems certain Carnage will never be free again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Knock Bosses Out Quickly;  Gain Life and Continue[CR]If you double-smash a pair of non-superpowered bosses without punching or kicking either of them beforehand, you can instantly knock them out.

Each level ends with a grotesque    boss creature for Rick to slay, just like the original  Splatterhouse.The story in Splatterhouse 2 involves the mask informing Rick that Jennifer is still alive and makes him return to the ruins of  West Mansion in an attempt to save her.        Much of the plot was lost during the game's Western localisation (from the Japanese Splatterhouse Part 2). One of the things lost in translation was an explanation why there seems to be a new        West Mansion beyond the one that burnt down in        the first game.[CR]",

Rick has married Jennifer and they have a son, David. In the final chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped his beloved family members. He has no choice but to wear the demon mask with the supernatural powers to save Jennifer and David from the demon-infested Splatterhouse.[CR]The third title in the series builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a race against time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to the boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance, special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.[CR]It still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence. You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time. The cutscenes feature real actors who act out the characters.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these on the password screen, you will hear a sound if entered correctly.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords at the password entry screen.",

The sequel to Cool Spot and the third game to feature Spot, the anthropomorphic red dot and then-mascot of the 7 Up brand of soft drinks. In similar vein to Sonic 3D Blast, Spot Goes to Hollywood takes the sidescrolling action of its predecessor and translate that to a sprite-based platformer in an isometric viewpoint.[CR]As one of the many Spots, players must run around various stages based on film genres, such as a pirate ship (pirate adventure genre), a haunted mansion (horror genre), an ancient ruins (adventure genre), and a space station (science-fiction genre).[CR]The game was later ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Burst, both released on November 30, 1996. Along with new graphics, new sounds, and new levels (based on the levels in the original version), the port features cutscenes that further develop the story (showing Spot being trapped inside a movie projector).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.[CR]In each level, the player must activate the \"exit star\" at the end of the level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map; the levels sometimes involve doors and winding walkways. In order to do so, the player is required to collect 60% of the plain \"red spots\" on each level. \"Spots\" are placed across the level in large quantities. A player's health is monitored by a Cool Spot face. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles.[CR]The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Various Cheats[CR]Pause the game and press the sequence of buttons, if successful the game will un-pause.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter one of the following passwords, then pause the game and press Up, B, B, A, B, A, Left, Left to see the secret message.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Arsys Software released Star Cruiser (\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc) for the NEC PC-88, NEC PC-98 and Sharp X1 computers in 1988. Building on its 1986 spiritual predecessor Wibarm, Star Cruiser was an ambitious and innovative game years ahead of its time.[CR]The game's innovations included fully polygonal 3D graphics (including nearly all objects, enemies, and backgrounds, with the exception of distant horizons that were pre-rendered), true first-person shooter gameplay (anticipating the likes of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom), gameplay mechanics such as strafing, fusion of the first-person shooter and RPG genres (anticipating the likes of System Shock and Deus Ex), 3D open-world sandbox exploration across a large game universe (spanning several star systems) with six degrees of freedom, 3D space flight simulator gameplay for exploring (and fighting enemy spacecraft in) outer space, a crosshair to target enemies (both on ground and in space), and a portable computer built into the player character's power suit that has various uses (such as displaying an automap and radar).[CR]The game also emphasized storytelling, with an epic sci-fi space opera storyline set in the 27th century, various plot twists, extensive character dialogues with NPCs (who have their own background stories), anime style dialogue portraits for characters, visual novel style POV cutscenes, animated cutscenes rendered using the game's 3D engine, and a chiptune soundtrack composed by Toshiya Yamanaka (later released as a seperate original soundtrack CD) using FM synthesis.[CR]The game had a large open-world game universe, allowing the player to explore over 30 planets across four star systems. This makes it the earliest example of a fully 3D open-world game.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The original computer versions, the Sharp X68000 version in particular, used a unique dual control scheme that anticipated the standard keyboard & mouse controls of the first-person shooter genre, with the direction keys used to move and strafe, while the numpad keys are used to turn around and aim (much like the function of the mouse in later FPS games). However, it is not possible to aim up or down while on foot (much like Doom), but in the outer space segments, the player can aim in all directions with the numpad keys.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In the 25th century, an inter-galactic war, which began when Earth made first contact with aliens, came to an end with Central Earth emerging the victor. 200 years have since passed. Now in the 27th century, the remains of the Earth Federation is known as the Federation Patrol, which has maintained a fragile balance of power with VOID, a nation under military rule demanding the deportation of the aliens. However, this fragile balance is being jeopardized by VOID's suspicious movements hinting towards a massive strike, with wars igniting across the galaxy.[CR]On Ganymede, a moon orbiting the planet Jupiter, a small batallion is dragged into the conflict and are being trained to fight back VOID. The story begins with the protagonist Brian in a tough training simulation, set up by his friend and comrade, Gibson, and his trusted droid, Freddy. After completing the simulation, they leave the main building and head to the restaurant, where they are given details on what is happening. There they are told that VOID has a base nearby that acts as one of their important strongholds and it is launching out threatening enemies, and Brian is asked to lead a \"kamikaze attack\" against it.[CR]Awards[CR]Star Cruiser won the following awards from leading Japanese computer publications at the time:POPCOM - Game of the Year (1988)Oh!X - Game of the Year (1988)[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]The game was ported to the Sharp X68000 computer in 1989. This version is considered the best version of the game, as it took advantage of the powerful X68000's hardware to add a higher display resolution, more detailed character portraits, and the most technically sophisticated 3D polygon graphics seen on a home gaming system of the 1980s.[CR]The version best known outside of Japan is the the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) console version ported by NCS in 1990. However, it was never officially released outside of Japan. However, it was possible to play imported Japanese copies, particularly in the United Kingdom where import copies of the Mega Drive port were available by early 1991.[CR]Namco was planning to localize the game for the Sega Genesis console in North America under the title Star Quest. The October 1993 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly previewed an early English translation of the game, referring to it as an action RPG that is \"light years ahead of the usual games.\" They noted that \"Players have been on the lookout for Star Quest for a long time\" and that it \"was well worth the wait.\"[CR]The June 1994 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewed a fully translated English localization by Namco, stating that it was set to be released in the United States in July 1994. A European release was also planned for 1994. However, its release in the Western world was later cancelled.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The game had a sequel, Star Cruiser II: The Odysseus Project, which was released in 1992 for the PC-9821 and FM Towns computers. In addition to the default first-person shooter combat of the original, the sequel also features an option for menu-based combat.[CR]Among later 3D Japanese computer games it influenced, the 1994 release Geograph Seal for the Sharp X68000 appears to have been influenced by the 3D graphics engine of Star Cruiser. In turn, Geograph Seal was the predecessor of Jumping Flash, the first true 3D platformer.[CR]Star Cruiser was also an influence on the famous game designer Hideki Kamiya (known for Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Okami, Bayonetta, Wonderful 101, etc.). In his blog, Kamiya mentioned Star Cruiser as one of his favourite games.[CR]",

Shuttle Craft Level [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is simple and mostly consists of platforming and some simple combat. To spice things up there are also boss battles spread throughout the game, as well as an interesting section in which you take control of a shuttle and must navigate through the wormhole and even an asteroid field to catch up to a fugitive. A few other challenges are added and a memorable  a level where you take control of the shapeshifting Odo in a stealth mission aboard a Cardassian ship. The point of the game is achieved, it feels like an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Crossroads of Time serves as an excellent example of what a good game was at the time as well as how to do a Tv or Film tie in correctly.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Enable Level Select[CR]At Password Entry Screen, enter the following password:[CR][B]DAVIDL[/B][CR]Level Select will now be an option on the Options menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Enable Level Select[CR]Enter these passwords on the password screen.",

Each planet has its own unique topography, climate, and gravity. The player is tasked to maintain, upgrade and staff their own starship in an RPG-like fashion. The ship is used to explore the galaxy and retrieve artifacts, minerals, and life forms from the surface of planets, which can then be sold to further upgrade the ship and the skills of its crew. While exploring the galaxy, players may also come across a number of alien races. How the player chooses deal with these encounters plays a major role in the progression of the game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The story begins on a planet named Arth. Years earlier, scientists discovered a deep shaft in the crust of the planet, leading to a vast and ancient underground network. Investigation of this network revealed it to have been built by the first colonists of Arth (remnants of an ancient society called the Old Empire). In addition to this historical data, scientists also uncovered sufficient technical data which allowed them reconstruct some of the Old Empire's technology. The most significant discovery was that of a mysterious crystalline substance known as Endurium, which served as the fuel for their superphotonic (faster than light) technology. Space TravelUsing this information, a company named Interstel is able to successfully build new ships capable of interstellar travel. With limited supplies of fuel available, Interstel builds a small fleet of ships and tasks them to search the galaxy for more resources (most importantly, Endurium). Players assume the role of a starship captain recruited by the Interstel corporation. In addition to procuring Endurium and other important minerals, players are also given a number of other goals: search for new habitable planets; discover more information about the Old Empire and the history of Arth; and build relationships with the other spacefaring races in the galaxy.As resources are built and more of the galaxy is explored, this initial setup (while seemingly simple) eventually gives way to a more complex over-arching narrative. Through a series of events (involving hostile alien races, ancient artifacts, and a mysterious Crystal Planet), the fate of the entire galaxy ends up in the player's hands![CR]The Making of Starflight[CR]The Starflight TeamThe following information is taken verbatim from the packaging of the DOS version of Starflight:The Dream\"Back in 1982, we approached E.A. with the idea of creating a universe on a disk that would let people experience the feeling of exploring the universe. It was an ambitious idea. We knew it would require a lot of time and the development of some new technology. We were more right than we knew.\"The Cutting Room Floor\"We rewrote the game script several times as we struggled to achieve our goals. We wanted the universe to convey a gigantic sense of space, complexity, and life. And we wanted an exciting fantasy role-playing game, with a wide spectrum of character interaction and activity. It seemed like whenever we were close to finalizing the script, we'd find another way to make the game more fun.\"The Planet Builder\"About nine months after we started the actual programming, we came up with the idea for the fractal generator. A fractal generator so powerful that it could create surfaces in space. It took 6 man-years to create the technology, but it gave us the ability to cram 800 complex and unique planets into each game, instead of the 50 we'd had before. There are so many that even we haven't explored them all.\"The Aliens\"To find the right names for each race, we wrote long profiles and histories for each, then tossed random syllables at each other for several days. To handle their languages, behavior, and combat-action, we had to devote months to building a sophisticated artificial intelligence system. We threw away the communications module three times before we had exactly what we wanted. Sometimes we wondered which would come first, flying to the stars in Starflight, or flying to the stars in real life.\"Breathing Ammonia\"Once the fractal generator builds a planet, the eco-system generator creates environmental conditions for it, like gravity, atmosphere, minerals, and temperature. Once we took a journey back to Earth, only to find the eco-system generator had given it new continents and an ammonia atmosphere. It took two years to perfect the technology.\"15 Man-Years Later\"The last several months were spent tying all the various technologies together. Because of the program's complexity and scope, the play-testing alone took months. But all the time and effort has proven worthwhile. We had a vision of what an outer space fantasy game could be, and now that vision is a reality.\"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy money[CR]Land on the planet and capture any life forms that are present. Return to the spaceport and sell the captured creatures. Leave the space port and immediately return. The life forms will re-appear in the cargo hold.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Title Screen (DOS)Starflight takes place in a galaxy comprised of 270 star systems, each of which contains a number of planets (there are over 800 planets in all). Each planet has its own unique topography, climate, and gravity. The player is tasked to maintain, upgrade and staff their own starship in an RPG-like fashion. The ship is used to explore the galaxy and retrieve artifacts, minerals, and life forms from the surface of planets, which can then be sold to further upgrade the ship and the skills of its crew. While exploring the galaxy, players may also come across a number of alien races. How the player chooses deal with these encounters plays a major role in the progression of the game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The story begins on a planet named Arth. Years earlier, scientists discovered a deep shaft in the crust of the planet, leading to a vast and ancient underground network. Investigation of this network revealed it to have been built by the first colonists of Arth (remnants of an ancient society called the Old Empire). In addition to this historical data, scientists also uncovered sufficient technical data which allowed them reconstruct some of the Old Empire's technology. The most significant discovery was that of a mysterious crystalline substance known as Endurium, which served as the fuel for their superphotonic (faster than light) technology. Space TravelUsing this information, a company named Interstel is able to successfully build new ships capable of interstellar travel. With limited supplies of fuel available, Interstel builds a small fleet of ships and tasks them to search the galaxy for more resources (most importantly, Endurium). Players assume the role of a starship captain recruited by the Interstel corporation. In addition to procuring Endurium and other important minerals, players are also given a number of other goals: search for new habitable planets; discover more information about the Old Empire and the history of Arth; and build relationships with the other spacefaring races in the galaxy.As resources are built and more of the galaxy is explored, this initial setup (while seemingly simple) eventually gives way to a more complex over-arching narrative. Through a series of events (involving hostile alien races, ancient artifacts, and a mysterious Crystal Planet), the fate of the entire galaxy ends up in the player's hands![CR]The Making of Starflight[CR]The Starflight TeamThe following information is taken verbatim from the packaging of the DOS version of Starflight:The Dream\"Back in 1982, we approached E.A. with the idea of creating a universe on a disk that would let people experience the feeling of exploring the universe. It was an ambitious idea. We knew it would require a lot of time and the development of some new technology. We were more right than we knew.\"The Cutting Room Floor\"We rewrote the game script several times as we struggled to achieve our goals. We wanted the universe to convey a gigantic sense of space, complexity, and life. And we wanted an exciting fantasy role-playing game, with a wide spectrum of character interaction and activity. It seemed like whenever we were close to finalizing the script, we'd find another way to make the game more fun.\"The Planet Builder\"About nine months after we started the actual programming, we came up with the idea for the fractal generator. A fractal generator so powerful that it could create surfaces in space. It took 6 man-years to create the technology, but it gave us the ability to cram 800 complex and unique planets into each game, instead of the 50 we'd had before. There are so many that even we haven't explored them all.\"The Aliens\"To find the right names for each race, we wrote long profiles and histories for each, then tossed random syllables at each other for several days. To handle their languages, behavior, and combat-action, we had to devote months to building a sophisticated artificial intelligence system. We threw away the communications module three times before we had exactly what we wanted. Sometimes we wondered which would come first, flying to the stars in Starflight, or flying to the stars in real life.\"Breathing Ammonia\"Once the fractal generator builds a planet, the eco-system generator creates environmental conditions for it, like gravity, atmosphere, minerals, and temperature. Once we took a journey back to Earth, only to find the eco-system generator had given it new continents and an ammonia atmosphere. It took two years to perfect the technology.\"15 Man-Years Later\"The last several months were spent tying all the various technologies together. Because of the program's complexity and scope, the play-testing alone took months. But all the time and effort has proven worthwhile. We had a vision of what an outer space fantasy game could be, and now that vision is a reality.\"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy money[CR]Land on the planet and capture any life forms that are present. Return to the spaceport and sell the captured creatures. Leave the space port and immediately return. The life forms will re-appear in the cargo hold. Sell the creatures and repeat this process to accumulate an unlimited amount of money.",

You are part of the resistance fighting to over throw an evil military empire, known as the \"Steel Empire\". While invading enemy territory with a giant airship, you take control of two aerial fighters. You pick between a small, compact fighter. The compact fighter is good for destroying land enemies. You also can pick a zeppelin fighter. The zeppelin is a big, easy, target, but it's massive fire power is good for fighting air enemies.[CR]The gameplay is different than most shooters. In Steel Empire, your ships have health meters, and the game has a level up system, where you collect[CR]experience icons to level up your ships fire power. You can also use massive electro-bombs that do full screen damage. Each stage has a mid-boss battle and a end boss battle. The game contains lives and continues, but the amount you get depends on the difficulty setting you chose.[CR]The game has a 1940s World War II type of theme. The game begins with a classic movie reel count down, and the non-gameplay screens are done in a classic movie reel flicker.

Special Champion Edition is similar in most respects to the original Street Fighter II (which never turned up on the Genesis anyway) except that all 12 characters are selectable from the get-go (the boss characters were originally locked) and the game engine has been revamped.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Choose Same Character Twice in Group Mode[CR]Go to group mode.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Racer is a cart-racing game, developed by Vivid Image and published by Ubisoft and inspired heavily by Super Mario Kart, and the first of its genre to allow 8 players to race simultaneously on split-screen. The game performed very poorly commercially on all systems, particularly selling badly on the PlayStation compared to other racing games released in the same year, and the decision was made to give the game a price drop almost immediately upon release due to poor initial sales figures. The game is now classed as very rare to find.[CR]The game features 9 characters and 8 tracks, and several different game modes. The 'Championship' mode is essentially a set of races with increasing difficulty. Once a player completes the 'Championship' mode on Bronze difficulty, they can play through again on Silver, then Gold, and ultimately Platinum.The game also allows for players to cherry pick their own tracks and settings to create a Custom Championship. Head-to-head racing with a CPU driver is also an option, along with practice races.[CR]The most unique aspect of Street Racer however is its Rumble mode, in which the 8 drivers begin facing each other in a circular arena with a destructible outer barrier along the edge with the objective of the mode being to be the Last Man Standing in the ring. To win, one player has to eliminate all of their opponents using the in-built weapons/abilities on each car or by simply punching the other players out of the ring (an ability that was available to all drivers). These offensive aspects of the game are also included in the race mode: weapons were not in the form of pickups like in Super Mario Kart, but rather each car had its own specific recharging weapons/abilities to suit the driver. For example, Frank Instein's car had the ability to grow bat wings and fly. [CR]There are 9 featured characters in the game (one of which is unlockable): Helmut: An ace pilot from Germany.Hodja: A magician folklore hero from Turkey.Frank Instein: Based on the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein.Suzulu: A voodoo specialist from Africa.Biff: A bald american 'bully' type character from the USA.Surf Sister: An Australian teenager (and the only playable female character in the game).Sumo-san: A sumo wrestler from Japan.Raphael: A suave ladies man from Italy.Rabbit: The secret unlockable character who is essentially just a rabbit who is featured in the intro movie to the game and on the box art. He is unlocked by either completing the 'Championship' mode of the game on 'Platinum' difficulty or by simply entering a password into the cheats section of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Edit Stats[CR]On the character select screen, press: [B]A, B, C, A, B, C, A,B[/B].Now select a character, hold [B]A[/B] and use the control padto edit your driver's stats.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Access to the Options Screen and then scroll down to highlight the Cup Password Option.",

Together with Adam's kid brother, Eddie \"Skate\" Hunter (Sammy Hunter in the Japanese version), and a friend of Axel's, professional wrestler Max Thunder (Max Hatchett in the European version), Axel and Blaze hunts down the syndicate once more.[CR]Streets of Rage 2 features a redesigned game engine from the original, showing larger characters and more use of the game screen (including a life bar system resembling the system from Final Fight) while adding new gameplay mechanics (such as the new Special Attack system and character-based abilities). These features were carried over to Streets of Rage 3.[CR]Upon release, the game received critical acclaim and is considered by many to be one of the best games ever made. In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Streets of Rage 2 as the 64th top retro game.[CR]The game was ported to Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System (Europe only) in 1993. Along with different levels and inferior graphics, sounds, and gameplay, both omit Max as a playable character. The original game was also ported to the arcade using Sega's Mega Play arcade board (based on the Mega Drive/Genesis hardware) in Europe, Australia, and Asia.[CR]Streets of Rage 2 was re-released for various platforms after nearly ten years of its original release:Included in Sega Smash Pack: Volume 1 (for the Dreamcast) on April 6, 2001.Included in the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection (for the GameCube and PlayStation 2) in 2005.Released for the Wii (via the Wii Virtual Console) on February 19, 2007.Released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on August 29, 2007.Included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) on February 10, 2009.Released for the PC (via Steam) on January 26, 2011 (both individually and in the SEGA Genesis Classics Pack 4 and SEGA Genesis Classics Collection bundles).Released for the iOS platform in April 14, 2011.Released for the PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on June 28, 2011.Included in Sega Vintage Collection: Streets of Rage for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on May 30, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Streets of Rage plays like a traditional side-scrolling brawler. Up to two players can choose between one of each of the game's main protagonists as they face eight levels of constant enemies:Players can choose the fighters that best suit their playing styles[CR]Axel Stone - Skilled martial artist. Sacrifices jump height for fighting technique.[CR]Blaze Fielding - Judo expert. All-around stats.[CR]Max Thunder - Professional wrestler. Sacrifices movement speed and jump height for power and stamina. Instead of shoulder vaults, he jumps with his grabbed opponent, which he then can use the Attack button to perform a Jumping Throw (if grabbing from the font) or an Atomic Drop (if grabbing from the back).[CR]Eddie \"Skate\" Hunter - Rollerblading kid. Sacrifices power and stamina for movement speed and jump height. By double-tapping either left or right on the d-pad, Skate can use his rollerblades to move faster. He can also throw enemies while performing shoulder vaults (by pressing the Attack button).[CR]The main objective is to clear groups of enemies within a certain amount of time (which resets after groups of enemies are finished) and move forward to the next area. At the end of each level, the music changes and players fight an end boss. Once the player defeats the boss, the level ends (giving player an end bonus while refilling their health).[CR]Players earn score by defeating enemies and picking up money items. They also earn a bonus at the end of the level, composed of a clear bonus (5,000 points multiplied by the level number), time bonus (1,000 points for each second remaining), and level bonus (5,000 points for Easy, 10,000 points for each difficulty above Easy).[CR]Each player starts with three lives (which can be changed in the Options menu), and can get extra lives by either reaching certain score thresholds (at 20,000 points, 50,000 points, 100,000 points, and every 100,000 points after that) or picking up rare 1UP items. When the player's health meter is fully depleted (or the timer is fully depleted), he/she loses a life. If he/she has any lives remaining, he/she respawns from the top of the screen, knocking down all enemies on the field. If all lives are lost, then the player can input a name for the high scores list (if they have a valid score) and is given the option of using up a continue (giving the player the base number of lives and removing all of his/her score). Each player starts with three continues, and if the player has no continues or lives remaining, then he/she gets a game over.Basic Controls and Attacks[CR]Players move around the screen using the D-Pad and jump around using the Jump Button (defaulted to the C Button). Pressing the Attack Button (defaulted to the B button) causes the player character to punch enemies, while pressing it repeatedly produces a combo of damaging punches and kicks (known as a Fury Attack), ending with a hit that knocks down enemies. Pressing both Jump and Attack buttons simultaneously causes the player character to perform a Rear Attack, which knocks back enemies behind him/her.[CR]Pressing the Attack button while jumping causes the player character to perform one of three types of jumping attacks: a stationary Jump Attack (by jumping straight up), a Jump Kick (by jumping left or right), and a Drop Attack (by jumping left or right and holding the down direction on the d-pad before pressing the Attack button). Both the Jump Attack and Jump Kick knock down enemies, while the Drop Attack leaves enemies open for Grab Attacks.[CR]New to the series (alongside the different types of jumping attacks) are two types of advanced attacks. The first type of attack (Single Attack) is performed by holding down the Attack button for a short period of time, then releasing it. The second type of attack (Blitz Attack) is performed by double-tapping either left or right on the d-pad and pressing the Attack button.Special Attacks[CR]Unlike the previous game, in which special attacks had it's own meter and was the same for each character (involving a time freeze while an officer arrives nearby in a cop car and fires weapons at the playfield), in Streets of Rage 2, each character has two types of unique Special Attacks. By pressing the Special Attack Button (defaulted to the A button), the character performs a powerful attack that deals damage and knocks down enemies at the cost of some of his/her health meter. If the health meter is nearly depleted, the special attack will not be performed.[CR]If the d-pad is not held left or right, pressing the Special Attack button performs one of these attacks:Alex (Dragon Wing) - Swings his fist around as a wave (resembling a dragon) surrounds it.Blaze (Embukyaku) - Performs a kicking backflip.Max (Knuckle Bomb) - Spins around with his fists outward.Skate (Double Spin Kick) - Spins around (on his head) with his legs outward.[CR]If the d-pad is held left or right, pressing the Special Attack button performs one of these attacks:Alex (Dragon Smash) - Throws an assortment of close-ranged punches ending with a powerful uppercut.Blaze (Kikousho) - Throws a short-ranged fireball.Max (Thunder Tackle) - Charges forward, dealing multiple hits at enemies in front of him.Skate (Corkscrew Kick) - Jumps up in the air and charges forward diagonally, dealing multiple hits at enemies in front of him.Grab Attacks[CR]By approaching enemies close enough (and not getting attacked), players automatically grab enemies from either the front or the back. After a short amount of time, they automatically release the enemy. By pressing the Jump button (as anyone other than Max), they perform a shoulder vault, alternating between Front Grab and Back Grab positions.[CR]In the Front Grab position, players can tap the Attack button to perform one of two types of combos (depending on if the d-pad is held in the forward direction) and use the Attack button while holding the opposite direction on the d-pad to throw the enemy behind him/her. In the Back Grab position, players can use the Attack button to perform a powerful body slam (or in Skate's case, a flurry of punches against the backside of the enemy's head).[CR]Weapons and Bonus Items[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Throughout the game, players can find weapons either dropped by enemies or by destroying certain objects (such as barrels, crates, and traffic cones). Players can equip a weapon by standing over it and pressing the Attack button. However, they can only pick up one weapon at a time, and picking up another weapon causes the player to drop the other weapon. The player also drops the weapon when he is knocked down or when he/she does a Rear Attack. Dropped weapons disappear over time.Knife - Powerful close-range attack, which can also be thrown (using the Rear Attack) at far enemies. Blaze's standard attack is a special double slash.Lead Pipe - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range. Max's standard attack also hits enemies behind him.Katana - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range. Max's standard attack also hits enemies behind him.Kunai - Powerful close-range attack, which can also be thrown (using the Rear Attack) at far enemies.Bomb - A grenade, thrown by Bikers, that can be picked up and thrown. Explodes after a short amount of time.Bonus Items[CR]Alongside the five weapons, there are five items located throughout the game which give the player health (or other goodies) or adds to the player's score. They are found by destroying objects (the same type of objects used to hold weapons) and are picked up using the Attack button. (Unlike picking up weapons, picking up items does not drop the player's current weapon)Apple - Common item that restores about a third of the player's health bar.Roast Chicken - Uncommon item that restores the player's entire health bar. Usually found at the end of the level.Cash Bag - Common item that adds 1,000 points to the player's score.Gold Bars - Uncommon item that adds 5,000 points to the player's score.1UP - Uncommon item (shown as \"1UP\" text) that gives the player an extra life.[CR]Enemies and Bosses[CR]Standard Enemies[CR]Throughout the protagonists' quest, they will be constantly assaulted by groups of punks.

It was composed using NEC PC-8801 hardware alongside Koshiro's own audio programming language. According to Koshiro: \"For Bare Knuckle I used the PC88 and an original programming language I developed myself. The original was called MML, Music Macro Language. It's based on NEC's BASIC program, but I modified it heavily. It was more a BASIC-style language at first, but I modified it to be something more like Assembly. I called it \u2018Music Love'. I used it for all the Bare Knuckle Games.\"[CR]The soundtrack was influenced by electronic dance music, specifically house, techno, hardcore techno, and breakbeat. The soundtrack for Streets of Rage 2 is considered \"revolutionary\" and ahead of its time, for its \"blend of swaggering house synths,\" \"dirty\" electro-funk and \"trancey electronic textures that would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game.\"[CR]The soundtrack got a lot of positive reception for its techno based tracks which impressed many gamers and critics at the time especially due to the audio limitations of the Mega Drive/Genesis console. Most notably, the boss theme is considered one of the best boss themes in the 16-bit era. The reception for the soundtrack was so high that the game's music composer, Yuzo Koshiro, was invited to nightclubs to DJ the tracks.[CR]\t\t[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level and Lives Select[CR]Go to the main menu.

It was ported to a number of other systems, but these versions are considered far below the arcade and Genesis editions. At the time, Strider seemed like one of the games that made the Genesis so unique, a home experience only to be later surpassed by Sonic the Hedgehog. Strider was one of Capcom's very first big Arcade hits, preceding Street Fighter II. The game was popular because the action was fast, furious, and original. The story sequences in Strider are also notable, as they had voiceovers in eight different languages.[CR]Starring Strider Hiryu, the game is based on the 1988 manga, called Strider Hiryu.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Yes, I do.[CR]In the year 2048, the world has been devastated by the Grandmaster Meio, an evil man who had watched the Earth from a distant nebula before taking over. He now rules the world with an iron fist from his space station, the Third Moon. On a distant island known as Moralos, the striders, the last defenders of the Earth are training to defeat Meio. Strider, the youngest and strongest of these warriors, is the man who takes up the task.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This looks unsafe.[CR]Strider is a side-scrolling action game, with platforming elements throughout. The player controls Strider Hiryu, who can perform acrobatic jumps, climb up walls, and hang from ceilings. Strider must use his skill set to overcome a variety of obstacles, and progress through the game's five stages. Each stage is littered with enemies looking to stop Strider in his tracks, and Strider has brought along his massive blade to deal with them. The game is relatively simple, using only two buttons along with the directional pad, one button to jump, and one to attack. Most enemies go down in only a few hits, the bosses on each stage being the only exceptions. Strider will have to avoid getting hurt by enemies, as he only begins with three life. He can gain more by collecting life tokens when he has full health.[CR]There are a number of powerups scattered throughout the game, which have a variety of effects. The most basic powerup extends the length of Hiryu's sword. Another powerup will make Hiryu invulnerable for a brief period of time. Some of the more important bonuses include the robots which come to Hiryu's aid. The first of these robots is the Dipodal Saucer, who charges into Strider's enemies. Second is the Terapodal RoboPanther, a large cat robot who follows Hiryu and attacks any enemy in sight. The final upgrade is the Robot Hawk, which, once again, damages any enemies it encounters.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The soldiers in the background of the Genesis box cover are actually shamelessly copied from an earlier version of the Space Marine armor from the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, complete with the distinct beaked helmet and bolter firearm for one, and the impractical studded shoulder pads for all of them.[CR]Prior to release, Strider was heavily hyped to be the first \"8 MEG\" (as in, 8 megabits) console game. The front of the box even states \"8 MEGA MEMORY.\"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 3 Continues[CR]During the opening screen press: [CR]A, C, B, C, A, Start [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Continues[CR]In order to get infinite continues, first put in the Genesis game \"Altered Beast.\"  As soon as the title screen comes up, pull the game out of the system (without turning it off).

The final upgrade is the Robot Hawk, which, once again, damages any enemies it encounters.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The soldiers in the background of the Genesis box cover are actually shamelessly copied from an earlier version of the Space Marine armor from the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, complete with the distinct beaked helmet and bolter firearm for one, and the impractical studded shoulder pads for all of them.[CR]Prior to release, Strider was heavily hyped to be the first \"8 MEG\" (as in, 8 megabits) console game. The front of the box even states \"8 MEGA MEMORY.\"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 3 Continues[CR]During the opening screen press: [CR]A, C, B, C, A, Start [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Continues[CR]In order to get infinite continues, first put in the Genesis game \"Altered Beast.\"  As soon as the title screen comes up, pull the game out of the system (without turning it off).  Then, put in \"Strider\" and reset the system.  To check to see if the trick worked, go into the option mode.  If you cannot move with the directional buttons (meaning if no option is highlighted yellow in the option mode), then the trick worked.  Play through the game, and you can use as many continues as you need to beat the game.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sunset Riders is an action game from Konami that sets four bounty hunters across the Wild West to claim rewards on wanted outlaws. It began as an Arcade game in 1991, which allowed for up to four players simultaneously. It was later ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992, and the Super Nintendo in 1993.[CR]The Arcade version was intended to be part of the XBox 360's Game Room, but it never transpired. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sunset Riders has four playable characters: Steve, Billy, Bob, and Cormano. Steve and Billy have revolvers while Bob has a rifle and Carmano uses a shotgun. The rifle and shotgun have a slow firing rate, but fire multiple bullets in a spread. The revolvers only shoot one bullet at a time, but the bullets fire at a faster rate.[CR]Players move on a 2D plane while being able to aim and shoot in eight directions. Some stages have two planes, an upper plane and a lower plane, that they are able to jump back and forth. Most stages pits the players going through a stage battling enemies and course obstacles until the reach the end of the level, where the stage boss awaits. Some bosses have henchmen assisting them, making the boss battle more difficult for the players to contend. Once the boss is defeated, the player is awarded the bounty on the targeted outlaw. If two players are present when the boss is defeated, the bounty is awarded to the player who hit the boss the most.Watch out for that log![CR]There are three stages out of the eight that differ from the other five where the players walk and battle their way to the end boss.[CR]Stages 2 & 7: These two stages puts the bounty hunters riding on horses throughout the stage until they reach the boss at the end of the level. The players stay on one plane and navigate the level by battling enemies that ride horses along the bottom of the screen along with a wagon where an enemy tosses logs from the back of it to trip the hunters off of their horses.[CR]Stage 4: The fourth stage is fought inside a saloon where the bosses stand on balconies at both sides of the stage with a huge chandelier hanging in the middle of the stage.Power-Ups[CR]Sunset Riders features the following power-ups to assist the player in battling enemies in the Wild West.Rapid Fire: Increases the character's bullet firing rate.Dual Fire: Gives the character a second weapon. Revolvers (Steve/Billy): One revolver shoots forward, while the second revolver shoots upward.Rifle/Shotgun (Bob/Carmano): Dual fire expands the area of the character's bullet spread.1-Up: Gives the player an additional life. Players can also earn an additional life by reaching a particular monetary benchmark.[CR]The player can acquire the two power-ups (rapid fire, dual fire) by killing an enemy with the sack, entering doors at certain buildings, or at certain areas of a stage. If the player already has both power-ups, they will receive additional money instead.Bonus StageGet ready![CR]Sunset Riders features a bonus stage that is played after the completion of the second and fifth stages. The player can aim the crosshairs and in eight locations of the bonus stage (essentially in all sides of the screen). Enemies pop in and out of the eight locations. The player earns bonus money on the amount of enemies shot in the stage.[CR]Stage Bosses[CR]Stage 1: Simon GreedwellGreedwell: bury him with his money![CR]Simon battles the bounty hunters on a balcony protected by two barrels and henchmen that appear out of the two doors next to him.Stage 2: Hawkeye Hank Hatfield[CR]Hank battles the bounty hunters by jumping back and forth between crates across the train tracks with henchmen providing assistance.Stage 3: Dark Horse[CR]Dark Horse battles the hunters while riding on his armor plated horse. Henchmen provide assistance by shooting at the hunters popping out of the saloon's windows.Stage 4: The Smith Brothers[CR]The Smith Brothers battle the bounty hunters inside a saloon with one brother tossing lit lanterns while the other tosses bombs that explode upon impact on the ground.Stage 5: El Greco[CR]El Greco battles the bounty hunters with a shield and a long whip. He also jumps around a lot to particular spots of the train to leverage his strengths against the hunters.Stage 6: Chief Scalpem[CR]Chip Scalem battles the bounty hunters on an stage where he uses the three pillars on the stage's background to jump off and toss knives at them. If the hunters are near Chief Scalem on the stage, he will attack them with the knife.Stage 7: Paco Loco[CR]Paco Loco fights the bounty hunters on top of a fortified wall while henchmen attacks with guns and bombs popping out of a tree above htem.Stage 8: Sir Richard Rose[CR]Sir Richard Rose battles the bounty hunters in front of his mansion. Rose can defeat the bounty hunters by firing bullets from his gun as well as slide attack when he's on the ground level of the stage.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]The Sega Genesis version of the game is considerably different from the Arcade and SNES port. Only Billy and Cormano are available to play in this version with four stages that have two parts. The first half ends with the character(s) rescuing a tied up damsel in distress, while the second half ends on a boss battle.[CR]The four bosses in this version of Sunset Riders are Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, Chief Scalpem, and Sir Richard Rose. Most of these bosses are similar to their Arcade and SNES counterparts, with the only difference being the Paco Loco fight, which takes place on a train.[CR]The Genesis's bonus stage also differs from the Arcade/SNES version. Within the four stages, players can shoot objects that may yield a sheriff's star for a limited time on screen. If the player collects this star they get to participate in a bonus stage for extra lives and money. The bonus stage pits the character riding on a horse chasing after weaving stage couch where someone in the back hurls prizes towards the screen. The player can collect more than one star per level, but the bonus stage can only be done once. If two players are playing, each player must get their own star or risk being left out of the bonus level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start with 99 Continues[CR]Go to ''Options'' from the title screen and set the sound to 0E and press A to listen to it. Start the game and pick your character. When your character looks up, press A, B, and C at the same time.",

This futuristic game represents a more aggressive vision of baseball.Setting/Plot[CR]Super Baseball 2020 takes place in that titular year. In the future, the game of baseball has changed to allow co-ed teams of players that wear exotic cybernetic enhancements and armor, and are aided by baseball-playing  robots. Even the umpire is a cold, calculating android. The game features two leagues of fictional teams, and all games are played in the Cyber Egg Stadium.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A close play comes under scrutiny[CR]Super Baseball 2020 plays like a typical baseball game with some notable tweaks. The game is played using an eight-way joystick and four buttons. The buttons each control basic actions such as when to pitch, when to bat, when to run, and to which base to throw the ball. The stick is used to guide the fielders to the ball, or the runner to the next base.[CR]The first thing that changes how this game is played is in the layout of the Cyber Egg Stadium. Areas of the outfield fence are now covered with protective glass, except for the center field, and this glass will bounce the ball back onto the field and into play. The foul zones in the Cyber Egg are reduced to just behind first and third base. Behind first and third base are the Stop Zones, which cause a ball to immediately stop rolling if it touches them. Near the fence there are Jump Zones, where fielders can jump to superhuman hights to catch a ball that would normally go into the stands. Finally, the robotic Umpire will also set the Crackers on the field between innings; these are land mines that will stun a player should they be careless enough to step over them. All of these features in the Cyber Egg Stadium add up to a game that encourages powerful hitting, more bases taken, and a generally more aggressive style of play than traditional baseball.Timeout![CR]Beyond the futuristic new stadium, a powerup system is also available to both the offensive and defensive team. At any time before the ball is pitched, either player can call up a menu of powerups for their pitcher, batter, or fielder. These upgrades come in three progressive strengths. Human players can also be traded for robots which stay more accurate over a longer time on the mound, but can explode and become useless after heavy use. Powerups are paid for with money that is awarded the player for good play, such as hitting the ball and scoring runs.[CR]",

The script was created by the game's sole composer and sound designer Jon Hey. The voice of General Ahkboob in the sequel Total Carnage is Ed Boon, coding creator of Mortal Kombat.

It follows Champion Edition (which first allowed players to play as the four Grand Masters Sagat, Balrog, Vega and M. Bison) and Turbo: Hyper Fighting (which increased the speed and balanced the game further). The most notable addition are four brand new characters: Cammy, Deejay, T.Hawk and Fei Long. It would eventually be followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo Edition, considered the definitive Super Street Fighter II.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This remake of  Street Fighter II featured a new scoring system that kept track of combos, first attacks, and reversals. Additionally, four new characters join the returning twelve characters from the original. Super Street Fighter II is also the first game in the SFII series to give full move sets to the boss characters. Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.[CR]Aside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire.[CR]Criticism[CR]For all the additions and improvements Super Street Fighter II makes over  Street Fighter II: Turbo, its biggest failing is arguably that it does not include the same degree of speed that made Street Fighter II: Turbo such a hit. It is perhaps for this very reason that, in most cases, this game is overlooked in preference to its follow-up -  Super Street Fighter II: Turbo.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Returning charactersSSFII featured four new characters Ryu Ken Masters E.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sword of Sodan was developed by Discovery Software on the Amiga and ported on to the Genesis by Electronic Arts on the Genesis. Both games were side scrolling adventure games but the Amiga version had better graphics, more levels, and more enemy types.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens with the following text:[CR]At the city's gates[CR]As so foretold in ancient lore[CR]Here stands the opening test[CR]Enter now this deaths door[CR]And thus begin the quest[CR]The game's story was about a king trying to get his throne back that has been taken by an evil wizard. At the beginning of the game you get to choose between a man or a woman. This does not change the gameplay and the character's design are heavily inspired by Golden Axe. You'll travel all over your kingdom from the kingdom's gates to zombie graveyard in your quest to get your kingdom back.[CR]The game ends with a final boss. He's known for firing lasers straight at you that were impossible to dodge. The only way to defeat him was to use a shield potion and push him all the way to the right. The boss would glitch into the wall and you could finish him off. This only happened in the Genesis version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] (Genesis Version)[CR]Your goal is to go from left to right, killing everyone. You can jump, do horizontal and vertical strikes and croutch. You have four different kinds of strikes (horizontal, vertical, jump and a croutch strike) and you must use each one according to the enemy that you are facing. However the only effective move was the croutch strike as it was the only way to hit an enemy without getting hit back.[CR]When enemies double up, you can only hurt the one that you can see and not the one behind him. Enemies can go through you and attack you from both sides. An enemies health is portrayed right beneath him and dead enemies sometimes drop potions. You meet different types of enemies during your quest like soldiers, giants and zombies. Each must be killed in a different way. For the giants, you must hit them twice with a vertical strike at close range then when his health is down to fifty percent you must back up and hit him again with vertical strikes. For zombies, when you kill them, deadly fire balls start spinning around them. Your best bet in this case is to hold down right to pass all of them.[CR]You could pick up potions during your quest. Some potions would give you more health and some could be combined. For example, combining 4 white potions would let you automatically skip a level. The game was also known for its violence. This game was released a couple years before Mortal Kombat and seeing blood and decapitations on screen was new at the time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip Current Level[CR]Enter the following code at the High Score screen.... [CR][B] [CR]HINANP [CR][/B] [CR]Then in your next game press Start on controller 2 to skip the level. [CR]Note: You muct get the high score for this code to work[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Skip[CR]On levels 1-5, drink four gray potions. That will teleport you to the next level.",

                "plot": "[CR]Valis SD is essentially a remake of Valis II for the Sega Megadrive/Genesis. The game overall is closer to the PC Engine incarnation of Valis II, but it has many aspects of the Home Computer versions, including the ability to switch between outfits and weapons via a pause menu screen. It also injects a fair amount of silliness in the game, but that's only to be expected! Most stages have mini-bosses in them, in addition to a stage-ending boss.  Yuko is capable of moving in several directions and jumping, as is typical.  However, the game has several play elements that are not present in other Valis games. Yuko is capable of firing both up and down in addition to left and right, an ability only found in this game in terms of the Valis series; She can also double jump and has bombs which clear the screen of small enemies, or deal damage to major enemies. [CR]STORY[CR]Yuko isn't happy!      Yuko is interrupted from eating an important pudding by the ghost of Reiko, who tells her she is needed again to save Vecanti (and potentially the real world) from a new King named Megas. Despite her protests, Yuko is dragged away and doesn't get to finish her pudding. Along the way she'll pick up many items and weapons to help her defeat Megas' forces. The storyline is slightly simplified compared to Valis II, with the elimination of the Rogures loyalist forces from the storyline. Everyone simply works for Megas!   [CR]CHARACTERS[CR]    Yuko!      Yuko: Yuko is a seemingly normal high-school girl who is in reality the Soldier of Valis. Granted a magical sword by her true mother Queen Valia, she protects both the world of Vecanti and reality!     Valia.     Queen Valia: The good queen of Vecanti and Yuko's true mother. She gives Yuko the Valis Suit II!     Valna.    Valna: Yuko's younger sister in the next in line to be queen after Valia.     Reiko.  Reiko: Yuko's old classmate, she's dead. She appears often as a ghost to give Yuko advice.      Megas!    Emperor Megas: The villain of the piece, he's much the same as he is in Valis II, only sillier.      Haizen.    Haizen: Megas' top general. He may actually just be the bug on top of his head.     Gaius.   Gaius: Another of Megas' generals, he is occupying Vanity Castle, just like in the PC Engine version of Valis II. His mechanized body is very strong.     Giran.     Giran: He is the boss of stage 2.  He counter attacks every hit with a rain of swords.     Zaluga.    Zaluga: He attacks Yuko as the boss of stage 1. He's quite large!     [CR]ITEMS AND POWER UPS[CR] ITEMS: There are a variety of items for Yuko to collect.  Small life: Looks like a little heart. Restores a small amount of Yuko's life.Large life: A big heart. Fully restores Yuko's life.1up: A small Yuko doll that grants the player an extra life.Point: A crystal worth bonus points.Bomb: A red sphere, it gives Yuko another bomb for her stock to activate when the player pleases.Invincible shield: A star which temporarily makes Yuko invincible.Weapon level up: Gives Yuko a new weapon, or powers up your attacks if you have all the weapons.Costume: A new costume! Pick it up to find out what it is.  WEAPONS: The weapons found in the game. The player can switch between them at will via a pause menu. Bullet: The basic starting attack. Yuko shoots a shot straight forward. When fully leveled it is the strongest weapon.Wide shot: A basic shot type which is wider than the bullet. It's about as equally as strong until fully leveled.Homing shot: The weakest attack at all levels, but it homes in on enemies.Three-way shot: A three way spread of shots. Quite useful.   The basic Valis armor.   SUITS: Different outfits Yuko finds on her journey. They have different properties! Sailor fuku: A basic school uniform. Yuko's starting outfit. China dress: Has slightly higher attack power than the school uniform, but slightly lower defense.Valis suit 1: The classic Valis armor, a well rounded outfit for all occasions!Speed suit: A suit with high speed and high attack, but low defense.Guard suit: Has low attack, but high defense!Valis Suit II: The ultimate Valis armor and the best suit in the game.  [CR]STAGES[CR]  Stage 1.   Stage 1: Yuko begins in the city. She must fight her way through various soldiers only to encounter a mini-boss who introduces himself as Kunopuff. He is a bird man armed with a gun, who upon defeat rewards her with the china dress and wide shot. Yuko then makes her way along a train platform, stopping to fight another mini-boss in the form of a golden dinosaur-like creature. Zaluga awaits Yuko in the subway.   Stage 2:  Now in Vecanti, Yuko is immediately attacked by a multi-armed mini-boss called Necrodept (who resembles a series of mini-bosses found in the second stage of the PC Engine version of Valis II). Battling through the strange life-forms found in vecanti, Yuko encounters another mini-boss, a super-soldier who drops the guard suit and homing beam when defeated. After scaling her way out of the underground to the snowy surface, Yuko must face Giran on her way to Vanity Castle.   The tank mini-boss.   Stage 3: Vanity castle has been taken over by Megas' army! After fighting her way through Megas' army, which interestingly seems to include giant flying turtles, Yuko is confronted by the first of a series of mini-bosses in this stage, a flying golden dragon who upon defeat drops the speed suit and 3-way beam. Of course this isn't the end, and Yuko must continue to fight her way through enemies and scale the castle. Eventually another mini-boss is encountered, a bizarre tank-like vehicle with multiple parts. General Gaius is the leader of the occupying forces, and must be defeated to clear the stage.  Stage 4: Yuko travels through the wasteland on the way to Megas' castle, encountering vicious slimes, dragon flies, and other such creatures. The first mini-boss encountered here is a dark knight whose head turns in to a snake-like creature after his body is destroyed. Defeating him levels up Yuko's weapons. After a bit more traveling, Yuko encounters another mini-boss, a flying lancer whose upper and lower body are capable of operating independently of each other. General Haizen waits at the gates of Megas' castle to stop her progress. He has three forms, and references both the PC Engine and Home Computer versions of Valis II (I.E., he starts of spinning, and the insect from his head is his final form)   General Tou.   Stage 5: The final stage! Yuko rides an elevator up to Megas' chamber in his castle, all while being assaulted by meteors, chunks of crystal, and what appear to be circular panes of glass. General Tou from the PC Engine of Valis II makes an appearance here as a mini-boss. At the top Megas awaits! Enjoy the charming ending after his defeat.   A trap for Yuko!

An expansion pack,  Syndicate: American Revolt (1993) and a sequel,  Syndicate Wars (1996), have also been released. On February 22, 2012 a  remake was released by  EA Partners and developed by  Starbreeze Studios.[CR]Backstory[CR]As the world of today slipped into the future, multinational corporations grew in size and profit. They came into positions to own small countries and to exercise direct influence over the world's governments. They practically became the world's governments, undemocratically controlling the lives of people through commerce. These corporations became known as Megacorps.[CR]One of the Megacorps, a European one, invented the CHIP. A device that is inserted into the neck and stimulates the brain stem to alter a persons perception of the outside world. The CHIP numbs a person's senses to the misery and squalor around them better than any drug and sold millions around the world. It could convince a user that the sun shone when it was raining and that they were more beautiful than they really were.[CR]The CHIP, like some  drugs, also made the user open to  auto-suggestion, allowing them to be manipulated by the Megacorps. The CHIP became a perfect tool for the Megacorps to manipulating the populace and to gain power with. It didn't take long before the Megacorps were corrupted and became crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over the world.[CR]And in the year of 2096, the Syndicates have not only upgraded the drug they push, but also the way they fight. Instead of using ordinary thugs, they now use teams of custom-built  cyborg  agents to do their dirty deeds.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role of a young executive in a small European Syndicate. The objective of the game is to spread the Syndicate's control globally.World view screen[CR]The world is divided up into 50 territories. To gain control over a territory, the player must complete a mission in that territory. Missions objectives include the assassination of an important person, the elimination of rival agents or kidnapping. Once a territory has been gained, the player can start to collect taxes within it. The taxed amount can be adjusted, but if raised too high, the population can become rebellious against the Syndicate.[CR]The player selects a mission from the World map and can then select and outfit agents with weapons and  cybernetic modifications. Between missions, the player can also research new weapons and modifications. This is necessary if the player is to achieve the ultimate goal of world domination.During a mission[CR]In the missions the player controls up to four agents from a fixed isometric view. This is to reflect the fact that the player's character is sitting in an airship high above the city map. The player tells the CHIP controlled agents where to move and where to fire. They will not react to any event unless the player activates Panic mode. During missions, the player can kill  civilians and destroy many things without consequence.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR] Pistol: Very cheap, but basically worthless. Medium range. Shotgun: Short effective range, but does more damage than the hand gun. Uzi SMG: Fast rate of fire, medium range and comes with plenty of ammunition.Long Range Rifle: Very long range and extremely accurate.Flame Thrower: Devastating, but with a very short range.Mini Gun: Gatling gun with a devastating rate of fire and an incredible range. Laser Gun: Will cut through anyone or anything that gets in it way.Gauss Gun: Portable rocket launcher. Hell yeah.[CR]Special Equipment[CR]Persuadertron: A short range weapon that fires a small dose of chemicals, which will make the target lose all their free will and follow the agent who fired.Access Card: Plastic card that allows some security doors to restricted areas to be opened. Will also identify the agent carrying it as a Police officer to other Police units.Scanner: Scans for possible threats and items in the area.Time Bomb: High powered explosive that will, after a set time period, blow with devastating force.MediKit: Will restore a single agent\u2019s health completely.Energy Shield: Will, during a very short time span, completely protect the agent against all projectile weapons.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Misc Passwords[CR]Enter these at the password screen for the desired effect.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Credit Password Easter Egg[CR]Enter ZZKJ as a password, and the game will respond with \"nice try...\".

The stages have copious amounts of hidden areas, and so need thoroughly exploring. Once again, Shere Khan and Don Karnage are hoping to stop him.

As Rex, a pilot for Earth, the player must fight against the cyborg invasion and put a stop to the war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Target Earth features two types of play. For ground based missions, the game plays very much like a 2D platformer. Enemies will attack from side to side as well as by air. The space-based levels are similar to side scrolling shoot'em ups like R-Type. With every enemy the player kills, they earn ports that can be spent on weapon upgrades. Bonus weapons can be unlocked at the end of each mission depending on player performance. The game does not feature any sort of collectable health power-up. Instead, the player's health regenerates over time.[CR]\t[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Weapons[CR]Do not collect any bonus weapons or destroy anything except the ship at the end of the first level.

Two years later,      Treco added the 'EX' and brought the game over to the Sega Genesis and Megadrive. The console port contained a number of significant  differences, including altered cutscenes and the ability to place your 'wingman' allies in four positions on screen instead of one as it was in arcades. Task Force Harrier EX was not a large commercial success, and has faded into relative obscurity in recent years.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Task Force Harrier has players take control of a    Harrier Jump Jet  and battle communist Russian forces bent on world domination. The Russians have the TU-190 bomber at their disposal, and pose enough of a threat to cause the United Nations to declare Defcon 2. The player is forced to unleash the full power of their Harrier jet to defeat the enemy before they achieve their nefarious goal.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Task Force Harrier is a classic vertical scrolling shooter, and plays very similarly to   Raiden. The player's Harrier jet is equipped with machine guns, flash bombs, ground weapons and missiles, many which can be powered up throughout the course of the game. Additionally, the player has access to 'wingmen'- allies that can be positioned strategically onscreen and that will attack enemies with their own set of weapons. The stages of the game range from low to the ground battles to high altitutde encounters, all of which take place inside Russian territory.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Skip[CR]When the title screen appears, press: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, A, C, B.

Taz can also eat many of the items found through the stages, some like chili peppers will give beneficial abilities like the aforementioned fire breath, while others like bombs will give the old Tasmanian Devil less pleasant effects.[CR]The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was also one of the first to feature a tagged soundtrack, meaning that the music in the game would react to players actions, something that was considered innovative at the time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]Pause the game and then press B.

Instead, the game uses generic city names for its teams, as well as featuring two All-Star teams.[CR]The batting/pitching uses the genre's standard camera angle of having the pitcher at the top of the screen with the batter at the bottom, but the game uses an unusual perspective for its fielding, which follows the ball rather than switching to an overhead view. The player automatically switches to the closest fielder in the ball's trajectory, allowing the player to quickly reach it and return it. The camera will continue to follow the ball as it is thrown around.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters (known in Europe as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: Tournament Fighters, and in the Japanese SNES version as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Warriors) are 2D fighting games developed and published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis on December 1993, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System (only in North America and Europe) on February 1994.Based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, each of the three fighting games pits the titular ninja turtles (Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo) against a variety of mutants, aliens, and martial artists from the series (usually to rescue their kidnapped mentor, Master Splinter).Each of the three games are known for having completely different fighting game engines, storylines, and character rosters. Each game also have their own unique gameplay mechanic: the SNES version has a Super Meter for powerful super moves, the Genesis version has super moves available at low vitality, and the NES version has a special \"ball\" power-up for a bonus special move.Tournament Fighters is the last in the franchise to be released in the 1990s (creating a ten-year hiatus ending with the tie-in game to the 2003 animated series). The NES version is also known both as Konami's last game released for that platform and as one of the few fighting games released for that platform.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Each of the three games have different assortments of playable characters with minor overlap. All playable characters (with the exception of Aska and Sisyphus) have appeared in previous comics and the animated series. The only characters that are playable in all three games are the ninja turtles themselves:Leonardo - The leader of the turtles and has a serious personality. Known by his blue headband and dual katanas.Donatello - The brains of the turtles who is often working on his inventions. Known by his purple headband and bo staff.Raphael - The surly wiseguy of the group. Known by his red headband and dual sais.Michelangelo - The easy-going \"party dude\". Known by his orange headband and dual nunchaku.SNES VersionShredder - The leader of the Foot Clan and the turtles' eternal nemesis: a ninja warrior adorned with spiked armor. Known in the game as \"Cyber Shredder\".War - A fierce monster with large claws. Referred to in-game as an \"intergalactic lifeform\".Aska - A ninja girl hoping to open her own dojo with her prize winnings. She is an original character exclusive to this game.Wingnut - A mutant resembling a bat.Chrome Dome - An android that Shredder once built to exterminate the turtles.Armaggon - A mutant, resembling a shark, from the future.Rat King - A crimelord who has a legion of rats at his beck and call. (boss, unlockable in Versus mode with a cheat code)Karai - A high-ranking member of the Foot Clan and a powerful martial artist. (boss, unlockable in Versus mode with a cheat code)Genesis VersionCasey Jones - A street vigilante who fights with improvised weapons.Ray Fillet - A mutant resembling a manta ray.April O'Neil - A news reporter (and usual damsel in distress for the turtles) who now takes part in combat.Sisyphus - A mutant resembling a scarab beetle. It is an original character exclusive to this game.Triceraton - Member of an alien species resembling a anthropomorphic triceratops (boss, only playable with an external cheat tool)Krang's Android - A disembodied alien brain and Shredder's oft-cohort (boss, only playable with an external cheat tool)Karai - (boss, only playable with an external cheat tool)NES VersionCasey JonesHothead - A Chinese-American firefighter who was magically transformed into a dragon.Shredder[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]NES VersionThe turtles have been challenged by Shredder, but before they fight him they decide to have a tournament between themselves to see who is ready for the encounter.SNES VersionA tournament has been organized and fighters from all over have entered, Shredder of course being one of them. The turtles decide to enter the tournament in order to stop Shredder and prove their strength in battle.One of the unique features of the SNES version was the different turbo speeds. At the highest setting, this game was faster than Street Fighter II Turbo at the highest setting.Genesis Version Master Splinter is kidnapped by four purple turtles. When the real turtles find out, Krang appears and tells the turtles that he has Splinter with him and that the only way to rescue him is to go to Dimension X and meet Krang. [CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]The endings on the NES version are basically the same for all four of the turtles. The only difference is the portrait of the turtle which the player used to beat the game. In the ending the winning turtle accuses Shredder of being up to one of his lousy tricks. Shredder says that they have not seen the last of him, he then gets up and runs off-screen. Splinter comes floating into the screen, drops down in front of the turtle and says \"You have performed well my sons. Now let us celebrate our victory.\"Endings (SNES)CharacterEnding RaphaelRaphael gives his thanks to Splinter and April by giving them a pile of gifts. Raphael then tells them he is happy to have friends as good as they are. MichelangeloMichelangelo decides to take a vacation in the Bahamas to do some surfing, then invites the other turtles to come along. LeonardoLeonardo says his daily training has paid off, and now he must set new goals and set out to achieve those goals. Leonardo then goes right back into his training. DonatelloDonatello goes back to working on his latest invention which then blows up. He then says he might have some money left over to start a new invention. AskaAska is happy to be able to finally realize her dream of teaching younger people in the ways of Ninjitsu. She then exclaims she will have the best dojo in the entire world. ShredderShredder says he knew he would win the tournament and that he has defeated the turtles for the last time. He now has his sights set on conquering Earth. WarWar exclaims that he won and that has shown the other fighters not to mess with an intergalactic life form. ArmaggonArmaggon exclaims that it is only natural that he won the tournament and that he is the strongest living being on the planet and must now conquer it. WingnutWingnut only entered the tournament to pound some heads. He pounded everyone else and ended up winning and now will be able to waste even more money. Chrome DomeChrome Dome now has the money to purchase the necessary computers in order to extract his faulty program. He will finally be able to exist in peace. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version review scores of 9,8,9 and 9 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, \"This has got to be one of the best fighting games next to Street Fighter 2, (and in some cases better than SF2). The voices are crisp and clear, plus the control is absolutely wonderful! Another factor that I truly like is the story mode set up with dialog boxes unraveling the whole plot! There are plenty of combos that will get you going! Another great hit from the pros at Konami\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip to bosses without losing continues[CR]To bypass fighting everybody and get to the boss trio without losing continues start a 1P game.  When the screen changes to the space map have controller 2 enter the game for a 2P game.  Have player 2 choose a character and select that person's home planet. [CR]Leonardo - Bio Planet [CR]Michaelangelo - Mirage Planet [CR]Donatello - Futuristic City Planet [CR]Rapheal - Magma Ocean Planet [CR]April O'Neil - Spaceship [CR]Casey Jones - Ice Planet [CR]Ray Fillet - Ocean Planet [CR]Sisyphus - Jungle Planet [CR]You can beat up a defenseless second player and the game will give you credit for defeating that character in the tournament lineup.  After you beat all eight defenseless fighters on their home stages the game will begin with the boss matches and you'll have kept all your continues.",

Unlike many baseball games, Tel-Tel Stadium takes a rather hands-off approach to the action, allowing the player to give commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling them. In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a \"pennant mode\" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.",

The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix \"tetra\", which means \"four\", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.[CR]Tetris Variants[CR]A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.[CR]IP Rights[CR]The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Tetris Giant[CR]Tetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.[CR]Sega also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest licensed Tetris arcade machine.[CR]",

It would eventually be ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Atari Jaguar and CD-based systems like the Amiga CD32, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and 3DO. The MS-DOS CD version featured Full Motion Videos of some of the rides.[CR]The game was also remade for the Nintendo DS in 2009 by EA Japan and on iOS around the same time.

The player must help Thomas the Tank Engine complete various tasks such as taking children to the seaside, bringing medicine to the hospital and delivering the mail. Dead ends, level crossings, other trains and vehicles create obstacles to overcome.[CR]The game was released on the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo. An NES port of the SNES game was planned, but cancelled late into development.[CR]Sega Genesis version[CR]The Sega Genesis release of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends is different from the rest. This game puts the player in the role of the engineer, and the player may choose an engine. After the player selects one, a Mario Paint-based game shows up, and the player can color the engine and the engineer, but the only one that will have a direct effect on graphics in the game is the engineer. There is no difference with the engines; all have the same statistics.[CR]There are three modes to use: Race, Game, and Explore. Race puts the player in a competition against another engine. The player must collect sweets and balloons, but avoid mud, red balloons, and engines. After the player wins enough games, Sir Topham Hatt (a.k.a. The Fat Controller) gives the player a medal.[CR]The mode \"Game\" features Sir Topham Hatt giving instructions to the player. He asks for cars to be brought to a certain station in a certain order, but they must get there quickly. If the job takes too long, Sir Topham Hatt will scold the player. If the assigned job is done speedily, Sir Topham Hatt will praise the player. Eventually, the player will earn a medal.[CR]The mode \"Explore\" simply is letting the player look around the entire map of Sodor. The mode is just like the other two, only there are no jobs.[CR]Unlike all the other releases, this game does not have The Railway Series stories.[CR]Unreleased NES Game[CR]In 2008, many unreleased NES prototypes were found, and one of them was a NES version of the SNES game Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thunder Force II is a hybrid top down free roaming shooter and a side scrolling shooter packed into one game, referencing the first Thunder Force with the top down section and staying competitive with the new side scrolling levels. Players fly the FIRE-LEO02 Execliza, searching to destroys bases in the top down mode and then fly through the side scrolling sections in search of defeating ORN once and for all.[CR]Weapons and Powerups[CR]Thunder Force II has a diverse selection of weapons that can be chosen at any time as long as the ship is equipped with the weapon power up. Below is a list of all the weapons and a short description of their usefulness.WeaponsTwin[CR]A default weapon, twin shot is a basic, no frills weapon that deals moderate damage with limited range. Twin allows the ship to fire two machine guns at a withering rate. Since twin is one of the two weapons retained after a death, it is a key weapon in the game despite its mediocrity.Back[CR]The second default weapon, back is basically twin with the exception that the ship can now fire forwards and backwards. As such, bullets stream from the front and back and can be very helpful in shaking a tailing foe off without having to meticulously fight off the opponent and putting the player's ship in danger.Wide (Top Down Only)[CR]A top down weapon only, wide replaces back when picked up and for good reason, as wide shots not just front and back but also from a 45 degree angle both ways from the front. Wide is good for confronting overall threats and is useful for keeping the tail clear from foes while dealing damage to units in front.Five (Top Down Only)[CR]This weapon feels quite like a spread cannon, covering a great area and dealing medium damage. This weapon can fill a majority of the screen and keep foes suppressed, but the only drawback is that it is hard to spot enemy bullets with all the firepower dished out.Des (Top Down Only)[CR]Primarily a ground attack, Des allows the ship to shoot at ground targets not just directly head on but at the two 45 degree angles, making this the perfect weapon for destroying bases and not putting the ship in front of danger. Des is effective against turrets since they shoot only in a certain pattern.Clash (Top Down Only)[CR]A weapon similar to the flamethrower from Contra, this weapon shoots swirls that constantly loop forward, destroying units in its path. This weapon is more powerful than most other weapons and could be used to clear the screen of enemies with proper directional input.Hunter[CR]The series' trademark weapon, the hunter shoots out energy balls that lock on to enemies and continues to follow them until they are destroyed. Hunter rounds shoot from the ship extremely fast, making this weapon the ultimate force in dealing with onscreen enemies. The only downside is that in top-down levels hunter rounds do not strike ground targets and can attack enemies that are invincible, allowing vulnerable enemies to slip by.Mega (Side View Only)[CR]The replacement to back, mega is a good offensive choice as it allows the ship to shoot three rounds forward and two rounds backwards, enabling good coverage of most angles during scrolling levels.Wave (Side View Only)[CR]A good early weapon, wave shots weave in and out of each other and can go through obstacles which make this weapon great for taking care of enemies further down the screen. Its oscillating pattern also can pick off units where other weapons cannot reach.Side (Side View Only)[CR]Extremely helpful in the later levels, side blaster lets the ship shoot directly above and below, great for eliminating turrets and falling enemies with ease. It can also be used to take out destructible flying obstacles without awkwardly positioning the ship at an angle that is disadvantageous.Nova (Side View Only)[CR]This weapon requires a bit of thought for proper use. It shoots rounds of energy in a spread formation, but will always shoot in the opposite direction from where the ship is heading. Therefore, to get this weapon firing forward, the ship must be \"flying\" backwards, or to shoot above, the ship must be flying downward. However, once this learning curve is established, this weapon can be used strike enemies from any angle.Laser[CR]The strongest weapon in the game and the replacement to twin, laser first either a constant beam of energy in the top view mode, or four lasers in rhythm for the side view levels. Foes will melt at this weapon's great power and strength.PowerupsClaw[CR]An add-on for the ship, the claw is similar to the options from Gradius, rotating around the ship and firing forwards. The most valuable addition the claw brings is that the claw can absorb enemy bullets if it comes into contact with it. The ship is capable of having two claws attached to it, making death from bullet fire significantly decreased if managed well.Roll[CR]Roll increases the speed at which the claws rotate around the ship. Bullets will have a much harder time penetrating through to the ship when roll is active. After a set time, the roll will cease and the claws will continue to roll at the original speed.Barrier[CR]Like Contra, barrier grants temporary invincibility for the ship.[CR]\t[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Options menu[CR]At the title screen, press and hold A, B, C, and then press Start.",

It is a direct sequel to the highly-regarded Thunder Force II and takes place 100 years after. The game tasks the player with piloting the Galaxy Federation's heavily armed Styx fighter against the dastardly ORN empire in an effort to destroy the defense installation Cerberus. Cerberus was in turn controlled by the ORN empire's leader, the bio-computer Cha Os. Battling through five stages in whatever order the player selects, the final multi-part level involves the infiltration and destruction of Cerberus from the inside, in order to end the war and return peace to the galaxy.[CR]Thunder Force III was also fairly innovative, featuring multi-direction scrolling, a variety of selectable weapons replete with up to two CLAWs (similar to Gradius' options), and allowing the player to determine in which order the game's six stages are to be tackled.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Enable Special Weapons[CR]While playing pause and press: [CR]up 10 times, B, Down 2 times, then continously tap B until the weapon meter is replenished.

The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.[CR]Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.[CR]There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.[CR]The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/socket[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Time Killers is a 1-on-1 fighting game by Incredible Technologies Inc, published by Strata. It features 8 playable characters from different points in time, past, present, and future. Each has been summoned by Chronos, the Messenger of Time, to act as his champion and defeat the other seven Messengers of Death...or so they are told. Once they've finished off the other seven players, Chronos reveals himself as Death, seeking revenge against the 8 warriors for escaping his influence in their natural time.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]  Gameplay in Time Killers is somewhat reminiscent of Street Fighter,  insofar as it includes special moves and hits of different strengths,  but it sports a less common control scheme. Each player has a joystick  for character movement and five attack buttons: Head, Front Arm, Back  Arm, Front Leg, and Back Leg. Throughout the game, the fighters can deal  damage to their opponent's limbs. If enough damage is dealt to an arm,  it will be severed and the corresponding attack button will no longer  work. Both arms can be removed, and a player can theoretically be left  in combat with no arms, fighting only with their head and legs. In this  case, the words \"ARMLESS WIN\" appears.[CR]Fatalities/Limb Damage[CR] Mantazz performing a Super Death Move.     The game also features fatalities, though they work differently than Mortal Kombat. At any time in the match, the player can decapitate their opponent with a well-aimed strike performed by pressing all five attack buttons simultaneously, though the attack itself is unreliable against a moving opponent. Also, if the opponent is dizzy, the player can approach them, push toward and all 5 attack buttons together, and they will perform an instant kill. This can be performed at any time during the match, taking off any remaining limbs, and then the opponent's head. The command is identical for each character.   [CR]Character List[CR]The characters in Time Killers manage to show a surprising lack of originality.  Each one plays off one common stereotype and just runs with it.  However, this was not a game that was renowned for its nuance.Rancid - Rancid is your stereotypical punk character.  He was framed for the \"X Murders\" in New Chicago, in 2024 A.D., and had just finished off the real killer before being pulled out of his time.  His weapon of choice is a chainsaw, which he wields with one hand. Orion - Grown in a test tube in A.D. 2885, Orion is a space explorer. He tried to report an alien attack without evidence, and fled in fear when the police began to focus on him.  He was abducted by Chronos as he searched the galaxy to locate the aliens responsible. He fights  with an electric sabre. Thugg - The primitive caveman of the group, Thugg fights with a giant  stone axe.  In his own time, he battled against a race of alien reptiles known as the Troglodytes.  These alien invaders were using humans as livestock for food and slavery. Lord W\u00fclf - Filling in the 'medieval knight' role is Lord W\u00fclf.  W\u00fclf was fighting to kill the aptly named Count Morbid before he was kidnapped.  Count Morbid was attempting to conquer England, and managed to kill W\u00fclf's family in the process. Leif - An obvious reference to Leif Erikson, Leif is a viking with a giant battle axe.  He fought continuously against Black Thorn and the Black Army, a squadron of undead. Musashi - Musashi is the generic samurai of the game.  Though he fights with a samurai sword, his \"weapon\" was supposedly his great intellect.  He was the  most brilliant strategist and the finest general in Japan, having only been defeated in battle once.  This defeat came at the hands of a powerful dragon, and afterward, Musashi traveled for years to avenge this defeat. Mantazz - Mantazz is the queen of an alien race from 4002 A.D.  Her physical structure is much like a praying mantis, and she fights with her claws.  Before being yanked out of her time line, her race was attacking (and overwhelming) humanity.  However, after her disappearance, the war quickly ended and the two species have been able to live peacefully. Matrix - By 3297 A.D., humanity has perfected biotic limbs.  Matrix, a female soldier from that time, has a single biotic arm and fights with a photon blade.  She lost her arm in a war with the robots, all of whom went strangely berserk and began to attack humanity.  She defeated the Master Drone, but was immediately grabbed by Chronos to fight in the tournament. Death (Chronos) - The final boss of the game and the only non-playable character on the list.  Quite obviously, his weapon is a scythe, and he can't be defeated in the normal way.  To win, the player must decapitate him with a Death Move or a Super Death  Move. [CR]Minutiae[CR]Time Killers was ported to Genesis in 1996. It was poorly received by critics for poor controls and graphics. The reason it was delayed for so long was to dodge the early '90s violence controversyThe arcade release allowed for the violence to be turned down, unlike Mortal Kombat at the time.Incredible Technologies went on to program a similar fighter, BloodStorm, which re-used many of the concepts of Time Killers, like the 5 button combat, limb damage, and mid-battle deaths.Incredible Technologies also went on to program the widely reviled Street Fighter: The Movie in arcades. Capcom was dissatisfied, and so redeveloped the game for consoles themselves.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Death[CR]To play as Death, at the title screen press C, B, B, A, A, A. You should hear a sound confirmation. Now start a new game and select any character, and you should be fighting as Death when the level loads.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Todd's Adventures in Slime World is a side-scrolling platform game for the Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis video game systems. Designed by M. Peter Engelbrite, who also created the Lynx classic Gates of Zendocon and a number of Atari 2600 titles, it is notable for containing an early example of a large-scale multiplayer combat game (the Lynx version allows up to eight people to play against each other), for having extremely varied gameplay, for being a side-scroller with a useful automap system before Super Metroid, and for teasing players with its vast number of secret areas.[CR]Players in Slime World are armed with a water cannon that can be fired at many angles and can kill most enemies in one hit, and they can also cling to and climb most walls, as well as perform high and long jumps. Although nominally an action game, many rooms require excellent knowledge of the player's abilities and can only be navigated in certain ways, frequently giving it an air of a puzzle game.[CR]The design of Slime World is especially unique for its use of carefully moderated levels of danger. A player can sustain ordinary damage from many sources, and it adds up quickly, but there are also common invulnerability shields and pools of water that remove all damage taken when used. But there are also red enemies that, when shot, result in a spray of red slime that can instantly kill even a shielded player, creating circumstances when it is best not to shoot foes.[CR]There is also a type of enemy called a Hidden Snapper, that instantly kills players that step over it. Snappers are often undetectable until triggered, and instantly fatal if set off. Canny players, however, may often detect subtle design cues left in the world by the designer, and safely jump over the lethal spots of ground. Players (usually) have infinite lives to explore the world, but lose all their inventory items and are also sent back to the last checkpoint arrow passed.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game contains seven \"levels\" that are more akin to game variations, each possessing not just its own map but its own variation on the basic rules. The variations are:Easy: A relatively simple mode with little red slime or snapjaws, good for learning the game.Exploration: Players are given a huge map with a great number of secret passages, and many enemies.Action: The hardest level in terms of enemy opposition.Logic: A slower-paced, solo-only mode in which the water gun doesn't work. Players must instead avoid, dodge or outrun foes, or find other ways of defeating them like mega bombs. While checkpoint arrows work, everything else in the world is reset when you die.Suspense: The player is given a severe time limit within which to escape Slime World. It starts at 3 minutes, but it can be extended by one minute for each mushroom collected. While the route to the exit is mostly linear, there are a number of false routes to confound players.Combat: Most of the modes can be played cooperatively, but this one is competitive. Everyone gets five lives, and the last player in the game wins. Players may find slime guns to replace their water guns, that are capable of directly harming the other players. There are also other weapons to use, with room-destroying mega bombs at the top of the list. The Combat map is also just as packed with environmental dangers as the other modes.Arcade: The greatest challenge of Slime World, in this mode the map is almost as dangerous as Action, but the checkpoint arrows don't work. While the map is shorter than some of the other modes, it's still fairly substantial, and the player must start over from the beginning every time a life is lost. In the Lynx version of the game, there is a second, secret exit from the map that, if found, gives the player an address to write to at Epyx Games for a special reward.[CR]Items[CR]The items in the game are:Slime Gem: Very common items that award a large score bonus and also heal the player a bit.Red Slime Gem: Rarer bonus item that awards a tremendous number of points, completely heals the player and gives him an invincibility shield for a while, but if accidentally shot, pops in a spray of deadly red slime.Triple Shot: Upgrades the water gun to fire three streams of water, useful for tough foes and crowded rooms.Slime Gun: Changes the player's ammo to slime, capable of harming the other players instead of cleaning them off. Strangely, the many slime monsters of the game are still killed by it.Shield: Makes the player invulnerable to slime for a limited period and completely heals all damage, but provides no protection against red slime or Snappers. (It does protect against red monsters, though.)Cleanser: Permanently turns a pool of normal, damaging slime into pure water, capable of healing the player.Enemy Bait: Draws enemies in the room to its location, where they are killed automatically. Doesn't work on some monsters, and red monsters still burst in a spray of red slime when killed in this way.Mega Bomb: When used, is thrown onto the ground a short distance in front of the player, waits a few seconds, then destroys everything in its room in a gigantic explosion. While the explosion doesn't work on Hidden Snappers (since they lurk in the ground, not in the room), everything else in the game can be destroyed by bombs: monsters, players, items, pools of slime and water, and even checkpoint arrows.Jet Pack: Gives the player the ability to fly for a limited time. Players cannot fire while flying, and pools are incredibly dangerous while using a Jet Pack, causing an explosion like a Mega Bomb if one is flown into liquid.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Shortcut in the Suspense level[CR]Note: this shortcut does not exist in the Lynx version.You can clear the Suspense level in about 1 minute.  No need to pick any mushrooms!  Look carefully at the Computer Map when you start the level.  There are footholds on either side of the top of the shaft.  Work your way to a room just east of the right foothold, and shoot the wall.  Stand at the edge of the ice patch and do a long jump.  It looks like you can't make it across, but if you clear the shaft, you will slide upward and across to the other side.  Now shoot the wall, and suddenly, you're at the exit.",

                "title_clean": "ToeJam & Earl",
                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ToeJam & Earl is a surreal-comedic action-adventure roguelike developed by JVP and published by Sega for the Genesis on July 21, 1991. The game stars two bodaciously funky alien rappers (three-legged red ToeJam and fat orange Earl) as they explore various floating islands (representing Earth) in order to find pieces of their wrecked spacecraft.[CR]The game received two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (a 1993 side-scrolling platformer for the Genesis) and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth (a 2002 action-adventure platformer for the Xbox). The original game was re-released on the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console) on December 22, 2006 and both the Xbox 360 (via an Xbox Live Arcade compilation) and PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on November 7, 2012 (as part of the Sega Vintage Collection series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The entire game revolves around collecting presents, gathering ship pieces, and fighting or avoiding enemies. In this surreal world, Earth consists of hundreds of suspended grass platforms in space, sometimes containing water or sand. The levels are scattered with Earthlings, who, without an offensive weapon at the aliens' disposal, must be avoided at any cost.The elevator takes players up a level.[CR]The game has two modes. In the first, \"Fixed Mode\", all the levels are pre-created and will be the same every time the game is played. In \"Random Mode\", the levels are all randomly generated and populated with presents, earthlings, and ship pieces. This was one of the first games to popularize randomly generated levels. The game also featured a revolutionary version of split screen mode, where both characters would be on the same screen, but when far enough apart the screen would split, allowing each to continue on their way. The screen would then become a single one when the characters got close enough again.[CR]The main goal is to collect all the pieces of ToeJam and Earl's ship. Once done, they launch off to their home planet and win the game. The player also wants to collect as many presents and cover as much of the map as possible. Covering map blocks and opening/identifying presents will net points, which allow ToeJam and Earl to level up. The player progresses through the stages by getting into elevators scattered across the levels.ControlsD-Pad - Move Around.A - Use item (if selected), Hold to sneak (if no item selected).B - Enter/exit present menu.C - Map, Toggle Between Use & Drop (if in present menu).High Fives[CR]In co-op, when Toe Jam and Earl walk past each other perfectly they give each other a high five. Doing so averages out both players' health bars, which is especially useful if one is near death.[CR]Presents[CR]Good PresentsSuper Hi-Tops - Cover ground quickly, stay on top of custard. This item can be found inside presents, but it can also be found in special shoeboxes that look the same in every game and cannot be randomized.Jackpot - Gain five Bucks.Icarus Wings - Allows the player's alien to fly, at the cost of looking ridiculous, for a brief period of time by mashing A.Slingshot/ Tomatoes - Projectiles to kill enemies.Un-fall - When an alien falls down from one level to the previous one, Un-fall will bring them back up to the level they fell from. It will not allow the player to skip up a level; the player must have already reached the level above.Togetherness - Only available in a two-player game, allows the player who uses it to teleport to the other player's location.Extra Life - Instantly gain another life.Promotion - Instantly level up (see levels, below).Innertube - Cross water without drowning. Watch out for sharks.Rosebushes - The player character drops a rosebush directly beneath them when the player presses A. Unless the player character is moving when the rosebush is dropped, it will cause them damage. This rosebush will stay until another one is used (only one bush can be present at a time), and disappears once the present expires. This is okay for blocking the progress of more aggressive enemies like the lawnmower guy, mad dentist, & bees. It's not so effective against the boogieman, phantom ice cream trucks, or tornadoes. It's useless against devils, shopping cart women, or hamsters, because they be can easily outrun regardless. It can also be used to interrupt a hula sequence. Rosebushes do not work on sand.Decoy - Will distract enemies by having them attack this inflatable decoy instead of the player character. It will pop after taking a certain amount of damage.Boombox - Makes all the enemies start dancing, temporarily distracting them.Spring Shoes - Enables Toejam or Earl to spring to far distances. Good for jumping over gaps to islands or away from enemies.Bad PresentsRandomizer - Resets all the identified presents to \"????????\" and re-randomizes the sprite graphics in case the player had any memorized.Total Bummer! - The player character instantly dies. Kills both the player character and their co-op partner if they're on the same screen.Earthling - Summons a random enemy right next to where the player character is standing.Rain cloud - Creates a rain cloud above the player character's head that shocks them at random intervals, dealing damage, for about two minutes.Book - ToeJam or Earl will read the book, which is so boring that they quickly fall asleep and become vulnerable to enemies. The player has to wake them up by tapping the controller buttons quickly. If both players on the same screen, both will receive a boring-ass book.Neutral PresentsRocket skates - Causes the player character to fly off straight forward at high speeds, unable to stop. Great to get to the secret area on level 1. Not so great on any other level, as it might cause the player to fall down 5 or 6 levels by accident.Door - A doorway appears, a portal to a random point in the level. It could take the player to an elevator or a ship piece, or it could drop them on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere, and they would have to fall down to the previous level to progress.Food - Good (read: delicious) food will heal the player character, bad (read: healthy or rotten) food will hurt them.Tomato Rain - Rains tomatoes on the whole level for a few minutes. This is both good and bad, good because if the Earthlings get hit with enough tomatoes, they'll die. Bad because the player also have to avoid the tomatoes or take damage.[CR]Terrain[CR]Water water everywhereGrass - The player character will have normal movement speed on this terrain.Sand - Sand (which actually appears to be custard) slows them down. The longer they spend in it the slower they move, as the character eventually sinks up to their eyeballs. Super hi-tops will place the player on top of the sand when used, as will contact with the other player.Road - On roads they will move twice as fast.Water - In water the health meter acts as a sort of air meter. It decreases while underwater, but returns to its prior state when the player character surfaces. This means the larger amount of health they have, the longer they can swim.[CR]Earthlings[CR]Earth is generally avoided by the intelligent races of the galaxy, as it has been conclusively proven that most Earthlings are completely out of their minds. Earthlings are scattered throughout the game, appearing more frequently on the higher levels, which also contain the more powerful enemies. In a fashion completely unique to this game, most enemy encounters are solved by simply escaping them. Since ToeJam and Earl mostly walk (unless they have a set of Super Hi-Tops active), they will have to walk in certain patterns to avoid enemy attacks or paths. Some presents will allow them to throw tomatoes as projectiles at the enemies to defeat them, but given the occurrence of these presents in the game world, it serves as more of a power-up than a primary weapon. Less common are the helpful Earthlings, who may perform a service for some bucks.EnemiesThe crazy dentist & hamster in a ballDevil - These devious imps bounce around in unpredictable patterns. Try to walk circles around them if needed.Hula Girl - She will distract ToeJam or Earl with her sensuous dance if they walk near her, leaving them open to enemy attacks. Avoid the temptation at all costs!Bees - The bees do high damage and come after the player character quickly. Try to put as get as much distance from them as possible, or use rosebushes.Cupid - He will fire arrows at ToeJam and Earl that cause them to fall in love, stupefying them and randomizing the control scheme. It will wear off over time.Mailbox Monster - He appears to be a normal mailbox until the player gets very close. Then a horrifying, gaping maw opens up and he chases the player character down with his terrifying cry of \"breee!\".Hamster In A Ball - This hamster will follow the player character very slowly and try to flatten them. They should be able to outmaneuver him easily.Boogieman - Totally invisible unless moving or attacking. He'll set up ambushes, and when the player character is close it will grab them while shouting \"Boogie Boogie Boogie!\"Mole - The mole digs around the ground and cannot be attacked while underground. He will try to burrow underneath the player character and steal their presents. Stolen presents cannot be retrieved.Shopping Cart Lady - This mega-mart shopper pushes a crying kid in a cart around and is constantly getting in the player character's way.Insane Dentist - The crazy dentist will sprint at the player character at full speed and try to drill them while laughing maniacally. He's exceptionally hard to avoid, and the best bet is to stay away.Lawnmower Man - A fat man with a lawnmower and a cigar, who has an odd tendency to try to run the player character over with his bladed contraption.Nerd Herd - A cluster of fast-moving nerds that flattens the player character upon contact, dealing serious damage.Chicken Army - A group of chickens toting around a tomato-launching mortar cannon. The mortar is wildly inaccurate, but they fire a lot of tomatoes in one volley and they have a very long range of attack.Phantom Ice Cream Truck - This ice cream truck materializes out of thin air, runs the player character down, and disappears like a Boogieman. It repeats this process until the player character is dead.Dust Tornado - A fast moving dust tornado will sweep the player character off their feet. They spawn and move randomly on some of the higher levels with sand. If the player character gets sucked into one it will take them quite a distance and then dissipate, often over space or in water.Scavenging Mole - A moving dirt bump. If it catches up with the player character, a hole will open and they'll shake out a present or two. Sometimes the bump will stop and the mole will pop up out of the hole with a miner's hat on and look around.Shark - Sharks are only found in water, where they will attempt to bump into the player character while humming the theme to Jaws. This is dangerous, because health is already constantly draining while the player character is in the water, unless they have an innertube, but this is not their biggest threat: that would be a major bug that causes the game to lock up and freeze if the player character jumps into water and land on top of a shark, leaving the player with no other option but to reset or turn off the system and lose all progress.AlliesWise Carrot - This wise old man in a carrot suit can be seen pacing back and forth. For two Bucks he will identify an unknown present for the player, allowing them to potentially avoid dangers like the Randomizer and even Total Bummer!s.Opera Singer - For three bucks this valkyrie will kill all onscreen enemies with the power of opera.Wizard - The wizard will give the player character a full heal for a single Buck.Santa Claus - Santa is a rare Earthling that can be seen rummaging through his sack and warily looking around for threats. If the player character happens upon Santa, hold A to sneak (if they aren't using an item). Sneak towards Santa while he is rooting through his sack. If he looks up, stop and stand in place. Don't continue moving until he looks down and roots through his sack again. If the player makes it all the way over to him and touches him, he will drop two or three presents before flying off. If he sees the player character moving, he will fly off immediately. A popular Game Genie code for the game made Santa Claus the only type of Earthling to appear, making the game significantly easier.[CR]Present Island & Level 0[CR]Level 0[CR]If the player collects two inner tubes, two pairs of rocket skates, two sets of Icarus wings, or any combination of those items equaling 2 or more, they can access either of the secret islands on level 1. The first, Present Island, is in the upper right corner of level 1. It is literally covered with presents.[CR]The second, Level 0, is a secret area that can be accessed by falling through a hole in the lower left corner of level 1. On level 0, the player character can drink from a lemonade stand for an extra life, or chat up some babes in a hot tub, which will heal all wounds. To get back to the highest level the player was on, jumping off the side of the Level 0 will let them fall back to it.[CR]Player Levels[CR]While playing the game, opening and revealing presents along with revealing more and more of the map will level up the player. Each present opened earns 2 points while each square revealed earns 1. Gaining a level will result in an increase to the player's life bar and in some cases will grant extra lives.

                "plot": "[CR]ToeJam & Earl in: Panic on Funkotron is the   sequel to the hit   Sega game   ToeJam & Earl. At the end of the original,   ToeJam and   Earl successfully found all the parts to their spaceship, and make it back to the planet Funkotron, however unknown to them a group of earthlings have hitched a ride on the spaceship and now it's up to Toejam and Earl to capture them all and send them back to   earth.[CR]The gameplay in this game involves trapping earthlings in jars. To do this players must throw jars (the main weapon) at humans, different humans take different amount of hits. Once you successfully jar a human they can then be collected. To exit a level the player must have jarred all the humans on a level and deliver them to launch pad located at the end of the level.[CR]This sequel makes several key changes to the original and because of this is often looked upon as the weak point in the series. The first and most obvious change is that the view has switched from an   isometric perspective (in the first game) to a   side-scrolling one. Another equally daunting change was that, unlike in the first game, the levels were no longer   randomized or randomly generated, all the levels were specifically designed by level designers and appear in the same order every time. It should be noted that in   Toejam & Earl 3: Mission to Earth ditched most of these changes.[CR]Two Player mode[CR]Like the original this game has a   two player cooperative mode. However there is no   split screen, rather both player occupy the main screen and must leave the screen together.[CR]Earthlings[CR]Insane Fairy - He flies around and drops pouches of laughing dust on you. If you get hit by the dust, your character will start laughing uncontrollably making them vulnerable to nearby hazards or earthlings. Sometimes you can hear him go \"WHOOOOOO!\" as he does a loop-de-loop.Construction Worker - The construction worker moves around the level on a jackhammer. If you're too close, the vibrations from the jackhammer will damage you.Rich Fat Lady - The rich fat lady herself is harmless. However, she usually has 2 or 3 pink attack poodles nearby and will call them if she sees you.Pink Attack Poodle - Pink poodles that will bite the hell out of you. They aren't so bad if a Rich Fat Lady is around, however if you capture her first, they will frenzy.Tourists - There are male and female tourists and they both do the same thing... take pictures with flashing cameras that will deal damage and stun Toejam or Earl momentarily. To avoid damage, you must press down on the d-pad to cover your eyes before they take the picture.Earthling Boy - A young, black kid in a baseball cap. He'll shout, \"Hey catch!\" and throw tomatoes at you. Not too difficult.Earthling Girl - A snickering white girl. If she gets close to you, she'll kick you in the shins.Boogieman - The only enemy to make a return appearance from the first game. The Boogieman functions in the same way as he did in the first game, sneaking around invisibly as he sneaks up on you and slashes at you while yelling \"BOOGIE BOOGIE BOOGIE!\" If you know one is in the area, use Funk Scan to pinpoint his location, and then bombard that area with jars.Cow Ghost - A flying ghost of a cow. Hard to hit, flies pretty high. Cannot actually damage you directly, but is known to  possess ToeJam or Earl, leaving them standing still and mooing, totally helpless to the attacks of other enemies until the cow ghost leaves.Naked Man In A Box - Exactly what it says on the label. Sometimes he'll sing an opera song, he's only vulnerable when he pops out of the box to sing or throw tomatoes at you.Dive-bombing Duck - A duck in WWI-era fighter pilot garb, riding on a flying carpet. He will divebomb you in hopes of hitting you.Balloon Boy - A floating kid with balloons tied to his butt. He'll hit you with spitwads if you aren't careful.[CR]Funkotronians[CR]Snood - Snood is a friend of Toejam and Earl. He also has like 15 eyes.Sharla - Sharla is a blue alien friend of Toejam and Earl, if you encounter her she'll want to hear some of your sweet rapping.Bloona - Bloona is a big fat one-eyed orange alien who will give you tips, she also has a crush on Earl.Lewanda - Lewanda is a purple alien chick in a yellow sweater with one eye who will give you hints too. Both Toejam and Earl have crushes on her.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] High Funk Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords at the password screen to go to your desired level with lots of Funk.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] High Funk Passwords[CR]The following cheats are to be entered on the password option, selected from the main menu.

Embark on a journey so vast, it spans the lives of three generations. Begin with Maia, spirited away by a winged dragon on your wedding day. Experience one of the four endings that will surprise new and former Phantasy Star players alike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]A glitch in the game will allow you to make either Laya or Kara always act first in battle and be immune to physical attacks, as well as moderately improve the speed and defense of the rest of the party.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]The glitch is activated in Skyhaven, when changing the Legendary weapons into Nei weapons.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]1. Decide who you want to always act first and be immune to physical attacks - Laya or Kara.[CR]2. Remove all items from that person. [CR]3. Make sure everyone else has their appropriate Legendary weapon equipped (Orakio Sword, Miun Claw, Siren Shot, Laya Bow, Lune Slicer).[CR]4. Speak to the second from the left old man, who says \"Nei is the word of ultimate power\".[CR]5. Check your status screens. For the person who had no equipment, attack and defense should be in the 64,000 range, and speed in the 220 range. For the others, the attack, defense, and speed bonuses of the Legendary weapon they had equipped will be permenantly added to their base stats. (Unfortunately, none of the increases to the attack statistic have effect on damage dealt in battle). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]The only way the person with 64,000 defense will be hurt is from a Gnasher (who will do a whopping 4 damage) or from techniques (which are unaffected). She will always act first.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]There are 3 side effects which may appear alarming but are in fact harmless. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]1. Colours will be unusual - this will be corrected once you check your menu and leave Skyhaven[CR]2. Last person in line will be shifted out of place - this will be corrected once you leave Skyhaven, and the out-of-line person will not prevent you from moving[CR]3. Characters will be renamed - this is permanent but harmless.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]You can win a battle instantly if you have the following situation: 1. Surprise the enemy 2. A technique bearing character with fewer TP then what a spell costs (ie 4 TP for a res spell) Instead of fighting, choose the \"single player command\" option and have that character try and cast a technique they do not have enough TP for. You will get a message that states something like \"Not enough tech points\", then instantly emerge victorious. Very helpful for when weak and facing several enemies. This will not work unless you surprise the enemy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]An escapipe glitch allows players to skip over Nial's generation directly to playing Aron.  Aron will need to do some of Nial's quest, but it goes much faster and easier with Aron, thanks to his healing and access to the Aero Parts.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]1. As Rhys, before fighting the king of Cille, make sure Wren or Mieu has an escape pipe.[CR]2. After defeating the king, select Nial's route by marrying Lena. (Do not choose Maia as the glitch does not work for Ayn.)[CR]3. As soon as the cinema is over and you can move, go into your menu and use an escapipe.[CR]4. As Nial, you will warp back to Cille dungeon. Walk through it again (you will encounter only Chirpers). The king and Maia are waiting in the same place as for Rhys, defeat him once more (an easy task with full HP/TP and a stronger leader). [CR]5. Select Aron's route by marrying Alair. (Do not choose Laya because Adan will be unable to complete his quest.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]At this point you play as Aron.  The Sub Parts, Laya Pendant, Twins Ruby, and Mystery Star that Aron come with are \"fakes\" that do not work, so Aron will need to collect the real ones as Nial would have.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Improve late-game character stats[CR]6. Collect the Aero Parts as normal.[CR]7. Fly to the rebel hideout and pick up the Sub Parts.[CR]8. Go to Hazatak using the caves to Landen, Aquatica, then Aridia.[CR]9. Get Laya as normal.[CR]10.

Tracks feature backgrounds from each country like Australia, Great Britain and Japan. Some tracks feature weather effects like rain, snow or fog. Each event features 20 racers for the player to drive against. The game uses a password system, rather than saving progress.[CR]Career[CR]The game features a robust career mode featuring 16 territories with 4 tracks from each. After each race, players are given points that go towards that country's ladder ranking. The player must be at the top of the ladder at the end of the 4 races in order to qualify to move on to the next territory.

Money can also be picked up by driving over icons that sometimes appear on tracks.

Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 6, wrote, \"...if you liked Top Gear, then you will probably also like Top Gear 2!

Instead, there is only one way from the start to the end of the road.[CR]The most notable feature of this game, which most players remember it for, is the fact that the player can increase speed by using turbo boost by pressing a button on the side of the console-mounted shifter and the engine temperature will increase in kind on the on-screen gauge. When the gauge reaches \"OVERHEAT!\" turbo boost cannot be used until the temperature decreases.[CR]At every sub-goal (reached after passing through about four cities), a power-up can be chosen, the three being: Hi-Power Engine, Special Turbo, and Super Grip Tires. If the CPU opponent reaches the sub-goal before the player, at the next race, the driver's girlfriend will move to the opponent's car. He can still win the girl back if he beats the CPU opponent to the next sub-goal. If the player beats the opponent with the girl in hand, a 1,000,000 point bonus is given. Also, the girl kisses the driver in front of his CPU opponent. If the player reaches the final checkpoint, in the process, the player will pass the CPU opponent and the ending scene is played.[CR]It was available in a stand-up cabinet, and a sit-down cabinet with decals giving it an appearance of a Ferrari F40, the car featured in the game. There were also conversion kits available to convert original Out Run machines to Turbo OutRun.[CR]Computer ports of the game were received with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Commodore 64 version was widely seen as a good game but 16-bit conversions got very negative reviews.[CR]These courses are raced straightforward in 4 sections consisting of 4 stages each.[CR]- Stage 1: New York[CR]- Stage 2: Washington D.C.[CR]- Stage 3: Pittsburgh[CR]- Stage 4: Indianapolis (End of section 1)[CR]- Stage 5: Chicago[CR]- Stage 6: St. Louis[CR]- Stage 7: Memphis[CR]- Stage 8: Atlanta (End of section 2)[CR]- Stage 9: Miami[CR]- Stage 10: New Orleans[CR]- Stage 11: San Antonio[CR]- Stage 12: Dallas (End of section 3)[CR]- Stage 13: Oklahoma City[CR]- Stage 14: Denver[CR]- Stage 15: Grand Canyon (Runs along Route 66)[CR]- Stage 16: Los Angeles (End of game)[CR]Some of the stages are not accurately portrayed to their real life counterparts.

Players can make evasive rolls to evade attacks.[CR]At the end of each of the 6 stages there is an end-of-level boss, as well as mid-level bosses throughout the stages. These outrageous characters, in fitting with the theme, include a giant named Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, a half human half rhino, an imp dressed as Santa Claus, and a spider with a one hit kill ultimate attack.[CR]Vending Machines, once beaten up, dispense sodas to refill the players health. Theses are placed throughout stages and during mid-stage cut scenes. [CR]The game grants a maximum of 3 continues.Regional Differences[CR]Aside from the naming for the arcade versions, the Japanese version had a few differences from other regions. The Japanese vending machines were branded with Budweiser logos, whist they were re-branded Power Cola elsewhere. In addition the Japanese version originally had stage 2 and 4 in the opposite position. This was changed to fix difficulty progression.[CR]N.B The Genesis port follows the Japanese stage progression but the mid-level boss has been removed.Ports[CR]The Original Arcade game has been ported to the Wii in Data East Arcade Classics.[CR]In 1992 the game was ported to the Sega Genesis. This port has some modifications from the original version, including the Santa-Imp being dressed in Blue, rather than Red and only throwing bombs instead of the original combo of bombs and syringes (most probably due to censorship).[CR]Other bosses also received minor changes, mostly making the game easier such as The Scientist's final form not having the ceiling baby-spawning or diving attacks. In addition he also doesn't say his dialogue once beaten.[CR]The intro has also had the mushroom cloud from the Nuclear event removed.[CR] [CR]",

It plays like a speedier version of Civilization, where the race to invent and craft technology and conquer enemies plays out in quick, real-time campaigns across various islands. As the game progresses, the technology tree gets more and more futuristic.[CR]Mega-lo-Mania was originally released on the Commodore Amiga in 1991 and ported to various other European computers like the Atari ST and PC. A Genesis port was created by Sensible Software which was also released in Japan and the US, and was renamed Tyrants: Fight Through Time for the latter region.[CR]There is also a Sharp X68000 conversion created by Japanese developer SPS and published in Japan as MegaLoMania: Jikuu Daisenryaku (\"MegaLoMania: Great Space/Time Strategy\"). The SNES version is based on this game, and was also released in Europe.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players choose one of four factions represented by a color and a divine avatar. Scarlet is red; Oberon is yellow; Madcap is blue; and Caesar is green (some versions switch these colors). The game is scenario-based, with a trio of islands that players must conquer for each Epoch. Islands are divided into between 2 and ~16 square sectors that each can be controlled by a single player and houses a tower. The aim of each each scenario is to use the resources available to take control of the island by destroying the other factions. To begin a scenario the player allocates the number of starting people to take from the limited man-pool available and choose a starting sector. After winning 3 islands they are given additional people and any not used are carried over; staying in the pool.[CR]The two main resources that must be managed are man-power and minerals. Man-power can be allocated to mining minerals, researching weapons, manufacturing higher-tier weapons, attacking enemy towers/armies with said weapons and constructing new towers in vacant sectors. Any people not allocated a job will reproduce at exponential speed -- that is, the more people that are unoccupied in a tower the faster they reproduce; a large idle population (say, 200) might produce a person every second or so while a single person will take several minutes to reproduce (it's probably best not to ask how a single person manages to reproduce at all). Each manufacturing or research job will take a number of man-hours to complete, so doubling the number of people working on it will halve the time taken. Each tower/sector is independent and must research its own techs and mine its own minerals, only people can move between sectors and each sector has its own limited selection of minerals to mine. Each weapon requires minerals but has many different possible mineral recipes with the most efficient recipe possible using the tower's mineral stocks at the time the research completes. Which weapons can be researched at a tower is limited by the available minerals and maximum (and minimum) technology level (or epoch) of the island. As the player progresses from island to island later epochs become available. Attacking an enemy sector (or claiming a vacant sector) involves choosing how many people the player wants to form their army, what they want them to be armed with and choosing the target sector. They will instantly appear in the target sector and fight any non-allied units -- the player cannot further direct the battle except to order a retreat.Epochs/Technology[CR]Epochs and technology available to players include:9500 BC (Neolithic) - Mankind can only fight with rocks and branches salvaged in their surroundings.3000 BC (Bronze Age) - Units can develop bronze weaponry and slingshots.100 BC (Iron Age) - Units can use pikes in melee and bows and arrows in defense.900 AD (Medieval) - Units now use longbows and boiling oil.1400 AD (Renaissance) - Units now have access to catapult technology and crossbows.1850 AD (Industrial Age) - Units can use cannons and muskets.1915 AD (WWI) - Units use bi-planes and machine gun turrets.1945 AD (WWII) - Units have jet planes and long-range bazookas.1980 AD (Cold War) - At this point the technology level is atomic and the player can develop nuclear bombs that will permanently destroy sectors. The defensive option is simply a counter nuclear strike, resulting in the mutually assured destruction of both sectors.2001 AD (Information Age) - Units can use futuristic technology, such as flying saucers and laser-guided turrets which are able to shoot down nukes in flight.[CR]In the final island scenario there are no towers and the game only requires that the player has saved up enough people from their starting man-pool to overwhelm the opponent armies.[CR]As well as opening up more advanced weapons later islands allow the building of mines, factories and laboratories in controlled sectors that give access to more advanced technologies (i.e. some minerals can only be mined with a built mine, not an open-cast mine, some weapons can only be built in a factory, some techs require a lab).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Epoch Passcodes[CR]Select OPTIONS and select LOAD to get to the password entry screen.  The password must be 11 letters long.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Epoch Passcodes[CR]Enter the word JOOLS into the password screen to get a hidden game that plays kind of like Asteroids.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The masked ninjas return.[CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway on November 1995 for arcades.[CR]It is a direct update to Mortal Kombat 3, adding new characters (all of which are the return of masked ninjas), arenas, special moves, and game modes (including an 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), while tweaking gameplay mechanics and character balancing. It is regarded as the most competitive game in the Mortal Kombat franchise (prior to its 2011 reboot). A special version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for consoles (known as Mortal Kombat Trilogy).[CR]In order to free up space on the game's memory, the screens detailing the game's story, as well as all of the biographies and picture endings for the original characters, have been removed. Regardless, the game's story is no different from Mortal Kombat 3 (involving Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is built off of Mortal Kombat 3 and retains most of its gameplay mechanics. There are four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and dedicated Block and Run buttons. Players have a \"Run Meter\", which limits their ability to run forward, and \"chain combos\", in which players can perform pre-programmed combos (by linking normal attacks together) that ends with an attack that sends the opponent flying. The combos are known for not necessarily requiring the user to be 100% accurate on the timing of the button presses, allowing the player to basically press all the buttons in the combo quickly and the combo would essentially play itself out. Each character has new special moves, chain combos, and gameplay balances.BRUTALITY![CR]Fatalities, Friendships, Babalities, Mercy, and Animalities return from Mortal Kombat 3. However, the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis versions sacrificed Mercy and Animalities for a new type of finishing move: Brutalities. Brutalities are long, complex combo strings that, when performed successfully, end with the victim exploding into a shower of blood and body parts. Brutalities require the player to enter the first ten button presses in the combo, and the game takes over from there, depicting the character beating the other character faster and faster until they explode.[CR]The game also marks the return of the Endurance Match (originally in Mortal Kombat), in which the player must defeat two opponents consecutively instead of one to win a round. The \"Choose Your Destiny\" screen reflects this, adding one Endurance Matches to each \"tower\". Additionally, there is a \"Master II\" difficulty, adding another Endurance Match to the \"tower\" while making the game more difficult.[CR]More \"Kombat Kodes\", six-digit codes that are entered cooperatively on the versus screen, have been added, including the ability to change the stage to whatever both players feel like playing. There are now three \"Ultimate Kombat Kodes\", ten-digit codes that are entered during the Game Over screen, with three new characters to unlock. The Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection removed Kombat Kodes from the online component in the game.Game Modes[CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 also includes three gameplay modes, each requiring a different amount of credits to start:Mortal Kombat - Traditional game mode with one-on-one fights.4 Player 2-on-2 Kombat - A multiplayer tag-team fight in similar vein to Endurance Matches.8 Player Tournament - A single-elimination tournament for eight players.Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures[CR]New to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is the concept of Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures, in which completing the game gives the player a choice between a group of bonuses ranging from battling secret characters to watching a demonstration of each Fatality in the game. These groups are restricted by the difficulty the game was completed on. 8-Player Tournament mode also gives the player access to Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures at the end.[CR]Novice Difficulty and higherShows the character's endingPlay a clone of Galaga (only previously accessible through a Kombat Kode or reaching 100 battles)Battle with ErmacBattle with Noob Saibot[CR]Warrior Difficulty and higherRandom TreasureFatality Demonstration #1Fatality Demonstration #2Fatality Demonstration #3Endurance Match against Noob Saibot and Ermac[CR]Master Difficulty and higherEndurance Match against masked Sub-Zero and Noob SaibotEndurance Match against Noob Saibot, Ermac, human Smoke, masked Sub-Zero, and Mileena[CR]Master II DifficultySupreme Demonstration (shows most Fatalities, Babalities, Friendships, and Animalities)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The 22 playable characters (including the three unlockable characters)[CR]The game includes 19 playable starting characters, two unplayable bosses, four playable secret characters, and one unplayable secret opponent. All of the playable characters (including the previously-hidden Smoke) from Mortal Kombat 3, along with Kitana, Reptile, Jade, and Scorpion from Mortal Kombat II, are the default starting characters in the game. Through new \"Ultimate Kombat Kodes\", Mileena, a masked Sub-Zero, and a new ninja character (Ermac) are unlockable as playable characters. A pre-indoctrinated version of Smoke, known as Human Smoke, is playable by holding a special button combination when choosing the robotic Smoke.[CR]Noob Saibot is still a hidden, unplayable opponent. However, because of the inclusion of masked male ninjas, he is no longer a palette swap of Kano (except in the Sega Saturn version). Featured in the game's opening gameplay montage is Rain, a dark purple palette swap of the male ninjas that serves as nothing more as a fake hidden character for stirring up rumors. Noob Saibot and Rain, as well as the three unlockable characters, are starting characters in the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance versions.CharacterDescription (Additional Notes)ActorKitanaKitana is a warrior princess from the realm of Edenia.

The Bank and Hidden Portal from Mortal Kombat 3 are removed. Noob Saibot's Dorfen and The Church, despite not being in the arena rotation, are now playable via new Kombat Kodes, which allow the players to fight in any stage they choose. This brings the total number of stages to 16. The level rotation works a bit differently, as the first five stages loop once before moving on to the Mortal Kombat 3 stages. The Balcony is always the stage played when facing Motaro. The Pit 3 is always the stage featured when fighting against Shao Kahn. Noob Saibot's Dorfen is always the stage featured when facing Noob Saibot. Scislac Busorez is always the stage featured when fighting Mileena, Ermac. or masked Sub-Zero.[CR]Scorpion's Lair includes both a Stage Fatality (in which the player uppercuts the opponent to the lava behind them), and a mid-match stage transition to Kahn's Kave. The Subway and The Soul Chamber still transition to The Street and The Balcony. The Subway, The Bell Tower, and The Pit 3 all still have their Stage Fatalities.Scislac BusorezScislac BusorezScorpion's LairJade's DesertKahn's KaveThe RiverfrontThe SubwayThe StreetThe RooftopThe BalconyThe BridgeThe Soul ChamberThe Bell TowerThe GraveyardThe Pit 3[CR]Versions & Ports[CR]The game was released for the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Sega Saturn in 1996. It never appeared on the Sony PlayStation due to Sega buying exclusive rights to release it on 32-bit CD-based consoles (as a response to Sony buying exclusive rights to release Mortal Kombat 3 on 32-bit CD-based consoles a year before). To get around this, a rare, special add-on peripheral for the PlayStation was made that upgraded copies of Mortal Kombat 3 to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. The game was later infamously ported to the Game Boy Advance on December 12, 2001 under the name \"Mortal Kombat Advance\". It is considered one of the worst fighting games of all time. An arcade-perfect port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released on November 11, 2007 for the Nintendo DS under the name \"Ultimate Mortal Kombat\", which also included online multiplayer via Wi-Fi and a port of Puzzle Kombat from Mortal Kombat: Deception. Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was also bundled in special \"Premium Edition\" copies of the PlayStation 2 version of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. The game was also loosely ported to the iPhone and iPad by EA Mobile on December 16, 2010. (Restricting the character count to 6 starter characters and 2 hidden characters, while remaking all assets in 3D)[CR]An online-enabled version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft Points ($10) on October 20, 2006, days before its intended Wednesday release. This version included 12 achievements worth 200 Gamerscore, ranging from performing certain finishing moves (online or offline) to completing the single-player campaign. The Achievements are notorious for having strange point values, such as 12. This version also includes online leaderboards, adjustable screen sizes (with support for widescreen and standard televisions), and an online mode similar to the \"Quarter Match\" mode on the Xbox Live Arcade version of Super Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. This version was granted \"Arcade Hits\" status due to high sales, reducing its price by half. However, in February 2010, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace due to Midway losing the game's publishing rights. The standalone version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 never returned to Xbox 360 under new publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Instead, a new release titled Mortal Kombat: Arcade Kollection was released on August 31, 2011 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and later on February 1, 2012 for Games for Windows Live. This new release featured another online-enabled version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as well as online-enabled versions of Mortal Kombat II and the original Mortal Kombat.iOS VersioniOS Icon[CR]A version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was released for iOS in December, 2010 by EA. Rather than using digitized sprites of filmed actors, all the characters are rendered in 3D. Although the moves and buttons from the original game are included, a simpler set of buttons and moves were created to make play easier using the touch screen. The new layout has a \"special\" button, which is usually mapped to a character's signature special move. As an example, instead of back-back-low punch for Scorpion's spear, the player just has to hit the \"special\" button. Also instead of high and low punch and high and low kick, there are just punch and kick buttons. Fatalities are also included, along with babalities, friendships, brutalities, and animalities. While the arenas are the same as in previous versions of the game, they are also newly designed for the iOS version. Uppercutting opponents into other stages is still possible, as well as stage specific fatalities.[CR]Playable characters include:Sub-ZeroScorpionKitanaNightwolfJaxSheevaSonya BladeLiu KangStrykerErmac - an unlockable characterJade - an unlockable character[CR]Four modes are available:Arcade: Standard one player arcade mode.

One of the best Genesis games out there, it is ashame that it did not sell very well.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Ultimate Qix plays much like the arcade Qix. You slowly box in an entity that is large and strong. While you are moving along your lines, you are safe from attacks, but once you press A, B, or C, and begin tracing a new line segment, you lose your shield and are vulnerable. If a alien (big one or the small ones always buzzing about.) hits you, you die immediately. If your current line segment is hit, a energy ball will streak up the line and if you do not finish the segment fast, will hit you, killing you. Running out of time will cause different things depending on what level of difficulty you are on. If you are on the easiest, an alien known as Balboa will come and attack you. He cannot be killed, and will only go away if you finish the level. All other difficulties will spawn \"Sparx.\" The Sparx will follow your lines and if you are on one and not drawing when it passes your location, you die. They move faster or slower depending on the difficulty yet again.[CR]If you box in a certain percent of the level (depending on the difficulty.) you win, as a massive explosion rocks the screen and bonus points are given.[CR]https://www.gamefaqs.com/console/genesis/review/R84330.html[CR]",

Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the balance.[CR]Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the  original first game in the  series; however, it is a different game with different locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cut scenes, etc.  Defeating the numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance the performance of Yuko's sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different strategies to defeat them.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Max HP/MP[CR]This requires 2 controllers.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Let's all have some fun![CR]The final volume of the Valis story arc to feature Yuko as the main character, this action platformer was released in America in both its Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 CD incarnations. The PC Engine version was released first in Japan on September 7, 1990, with the Mega Drive version following a little under a year later. Apart from improved graphics and level design, one additional tweak to the Valis series came in the form of additional player characters \u2013in addition to Yuko, the player could switch to Cham and Valna (once acquired), each with their own weapon and magic sets.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Layzus and Valis.[CR]Yuko has been living a normal life again since the events of Valis II; however, a crisis is at hand in Vecanti! King Grames of the devil world has come and conquered, and he has his sights set on merging both of these worlds with reality! He is also somehow in possession of the Layzus sword, the twin and opposite of the Valis sword and long thought lost. Cham comes and attempts to steal the Valis sword as Yuko sleeps to avenge her murdered father... what will Yuko do?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Incorporating the familiar action platforming style found in Castlevania, as well as previous Valis games, the player must navigate each stage to find and defeat the boss of that level. In addition to the usual jump and attack, Valis III introduces a sliding maneuver for the characters as well. Characters can also \"high jump\" by holding up during a jump. Yuko, Valna and Cham can each be selected at will for their appropriate skills (some levels cannot be completed without using Valna\u2019s magic, for example).Yuko's ice cutter.[CR]A weapon gauge displays the current power of the player\u2019s weapons, and power up icons can be collected during play to increase that level. The weapon power bar refills over time, and the more full the bar is the stronger the attack; thusly, attacking rapidly is much weaker than allowing the attack to charge and then striking. Magical attack power ups take the form of Fire, Ice and Thunder, which are shared by all three characters, but each with different results. There is no longer a point score as in previous Valis games, so collected crystals will instead fill the player\u2019s magic meter.[CR]Items[CR]A 1up.[CR]Several items are found throughout the game; they are contained in \"item boxes\". Break them open to see what's inside.Heal: Restores 4 points of life.Recover: Restores 16 points of life.S magic: Restores 2 magic points.B magic: Restores 8 magic points.Power up: Raises a character's weapon power level by 1.Energy speed: Increases the rate at which the weapon energy bar refills.1up: Grants the player an extra life.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Yuko again.[CR]Yuko: A high school student in the human world, chosen by queen Valia in the original game to wield the sword of Valis.Fire Dagger: Causes several small fiery daggers to form and float behind Yuko; they home in and attack enemies.Ice Cutter: Yuko fires a shot straight forward which can freeze enemies solid.Thunder Sword: A burst of energy strikes all enemies on the screen.Valna[CR]Valna: The princess of Vecanti (the dream world), and Yuko\u2019s twin sister. Her weapon is a staff which fires projectiles; she focuses mainly on magic. Heavy usage of her ice magic is necessary to complete some parts of the game. Her fire magic is heat spinner, her ice magic is death cube, and her thunder magic is thunder storm.Heat Spinner:Death Cube:Thunder Storm:Cham[CR]Cham (Char in the US Turbo CD version): A refugee from the devil world whose father was executed by Grames. She enters reality in order to steal the sword of Valis and have her revenge on Grames, but ends up befriending Yuko. Her weapon of choice is a barbed whip. Her fire magic is fire dragon, her ice magic is ice arrow, and her thunder magic is lightning bolt.Fire Dragon: Cham creates a fire dragon that homes in on enemies and is active for a long period of time.Ice Arrow: Cham fires projectiles to her left and right which can freeze enemies.Lightning Bolt: Cham fires a spread of lightning bolts in multiple directions.Grames[CR]King Grames (King Ramses in the US Turbo CD version): The new leader of the Vecanti, he is the leader of the Raffine clan and is originally from the world of devils. He is armed with the dreadful Layzus sword, a twin of the Valis sword and allegedly equal in power. He is attempting to merge all three worlds together, but in the end he has the more insane goal of combining the two sword's power so as to challenge the gods. He also happened to murder Cham's father as he was opposed to Grame's goals of invasion.I crave vengeance![CR]Rogures (Rogles in the US games): The villain of the original Valis game, he has been returned to life. He agrees to work for Grames in an opportunity to get revenge on Yuko.Zalude.[CR]Zalude: One of Grames' generals, met fairly early in Valis III as a boss fight. He makes a bizarre cameo appearance in Valis IV as well.[CR] Ohohohoho![CR]Asura: An icy General of Grames, he is very vain and a narcissist. His pre-battle dialogue with Valna is an obnoxious \"laugh-off\".Wise men have beards.[CR]Nizetti: After testing Yuko with a harrowing trial, he unlocks her true power.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1: Cham attempts to make off with the Valis sword, but unfortunately minions of Grames have followed her and attempt to take the sword themselves. Yuko has to rescue Cham from a ball-and-chain wielding devil. After rescuing Cham, she becomes playable![CR]Stage 2: Yuko and Cham travel to the dream-world of Vecanti; Grames' forces have already arrived and conquered! Yuko and Cham must traverse a mountain pass, fighting past scorpion men and other bizarre creatures on the way. On the path several wounded soldiers inform them Vanity Castle has been taken and Valna has been imprisoned. A devilish winged soldier of Grames awaits at the top of a waterfall for our heroines.[CR]Stage 3: A spooky forest on the way to the tower were Valna is held! Our heroines are immediately assaulted by invisible soldiers and chomping jaws. A mysterious ferryman offers to take the girls across the lake, but he can only take one at a time...fishmen assault whoever was chosen on the way, but wait! It was all a trap, and the ferryman is the boss. He transforms in to a rather weak serpent.[CR]Stage 4: The tower where Valna is held! Yuko (or Cham, as they're still separated) must scale the tower and fight off the various guards. Valna is imprisoned in a crystal at the top! After freeing her, Valna must fight the stage boss, the fire devil Koriranba, on her own.[CR]Stage 5: Yuko and co. head to the sacred place called Sazarland to meet with Nizetti, who (according to Valna) can unlock the true power of the Valis sword. Probably the most infamous stage in the game, heavy usage of Valna's death cube magic is vital to pass the stage. At the end, a bell must be rung a number of times to prove the hero is worthy to enter Sazarland!The coinage of the Gods.[CR]Stage 6: After proving themselves worthy, our heroines must test their resolve by climbing Nirvan Road, a path which leads to the heavens. Along the way, Yuko encounters the spirits of some of her departed comrades (I.E., Reiko and Valia) Yuko must face an onslaught of soldiers to test her bravery!The horror![CR]Stage 7: King Grames dispatches his generals to dispose of Yuko! Arriving in the Grames' devil world, our heroines traverse a frightful graveyard, populated by typically graveyard-esque denizens. Flying bloody crosses attempt to impale our protagonists, and huge mounds of bones are a testament to the terrible rule of Grames. Rogures awaits Yuko at the end, eager for revenge! He's not afraid to use some of his same old tricks, but he also has a newfound fondness for knives![CR]Stage 8: Continuing on their way, Yuko and co. pass through a desert full of the remains of long-dead giant creatures. Of course, no video game desert is complete with giant ant lions and sand dwelling fish! Zalude awaits at the end to attack our heroines with an array of saw blades and a mighty shoulder tackle![CR]Stage 9: Next stop, an icy cave! Flying ammonites float casually though the air, and ice-men hurl themselves suicidally at our ladies in an all-out effort to stop their advances. Asura waits at the end of the caves, eager to prove his beauty and strength. He teleports and leaps about, hurling a variety of projectiles as he does so.The tower of King Grames.[CR]Stage 10: Grames hasn't been sitting idly by during all this; he's invaded the human world! His foreboding tower has sprung up in the middle of Tokyo; it's time for Yuko and friends to make a final stand, scale his tower and take him down! Grames will be the toughest opponent Yuko has ever faced; she'd better be ready! He's capable of everything Yuko can do, and more!We'll miss you, Yuko![CR]Nevertheless, Grames falls before Yuko's sword; for her long and hard work, Yuko ascends to Godhood in the ending. Thusly a new path opens for the people of the devil world and the people of the dreamworld Vecanti to co-exist peacefully.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 8,8,7,8 stating, \"...this is the best of the Valis trilogy yet!\"[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select &amp; Visual Select[CR]At the title screen, enter the codes below[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select &amp; Visual Select[CR]Hold A + B + C and press Start at the title screen.

                "plot": "[CR]Story [CR]In 2049, after having ruined the       Earth by littering and polluting,      humans embark on a journey to find colonize other planets. They leave behind mechanical beings known as 'orbots' that are meant to clean up the planet until they return.[CR]A high-level orbot known as Raster is tasked with watching the Earth through a worldwide network. Unfortunately, he is accidentally attached to a working nuclear-missile by a lesser orbot and goes insane, becoming a dictator named WarHead.[CR]    Vectorman, an orbot responsible for dumping refuse into the sun, returns to Earth after one of his rounds to find every other orbot on Earth to be infected with a virus causing them to turn hostile with a plan to ambush the humans when they return. He then takes on the responsibility of saving earth and stopping the source of the virus. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Vectorman is a 2D side-scrolling shooter/platformer. The player must run, jump, and shoot through multiple stages before a timer runs out, collecting power-ups and defeating bosses along the way.  In addition to his regular humanoid form, Vectorman can morph into other forms by collecting special power-ups that allow him to access areas and accomplish feats that would otherwise be impossible. Vectorman may also morph for special boss stages while squaring off against WarHead.  [CR][B]Power-ups:[/B][CR]Power-ups in Vectorman are collected by destroying TVs. There are many power-ups that Vectorman can collect ranging from typical 1-ups, timer extensions, health refills and upgrades, and progress checkpoints. In addition to these are multipliers (which multiply your score as well as some other power-ups, such as 1-ups), shot upgrades (such as a 'rapid fire' shot, akin to a machine gun, and a 'wave' shot that disperses a range of shots outward at an angle), and morph upgrades. Morph upgrades are collected in the same way as normal upgrades and temporarily morph Vectorman into devices such as a bomb or drill, and vehicles such as a buggie or jet.  [CR]Special Boss Stages[CR]In addition to levels with typical end-level bosses are special stages in which Vectorman fights WarHead. In these themed stages, Vectorman morphs into various things congruous with the theme, such as a train, a spinning top, or a cricket. The only objective in these stages are to defeat the current form of WarHead.  [CR]Bonus Stages[CR]In some of the regular levels are satellite dishes. These dishes are protected by shields that can be disabled by destroying the shield generator, which is often in a separate area. Once Vectorman disables the shield, he can destroy the satellite dish, which completes the current level and sends the player to a bonus stage. In these bonus stages, Vectorman is represented by a green orb in the center of the screen. The object of the bonus stage is to simply stay alive by shooting circling mines and WarHead heads (and the shots that these WarHeads shoot) by pressing the directional pad in the direction you want to shoot. The player will receive a certain amount of points depending on if he/she survived the stage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Pause the game and press:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]To access a debug mode, on the options screen press A, B, B, A, Down, A, B, B, A.  A menu will be brought up with health, lives, level select, and weapon options. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Enter this code at the options menu. You should be taken to a new section of the options menu that'll let have access to any level, choose how much health and lives you have and lets you choose which powerup weapon to start with. Only downside is you can't see the good ending if you use it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Blow up SEGA logo[CR]At the SEGA screen, move Vectorman slightly to the right of the logo. Aim upwards and shoot. There is a hidden T.V. monitor there. Once it is broken, there will be an orb power up. Grab it and when you use it, the SEGA logo will go dark and the background will stop moving.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Warp[CR]When you turn on the game you can move Vectorman around, on the SEGA screen. Shoot the SEGA logo 24 times, jump and hit the sega logo with Vectorman's Head 12 times, and the letters S E G and A will start falling.  Catch 90 to 110 letters to start on Stage 5, catch over 110 letters to start on Day 10.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Virtual Bart was one of the many Simpsons games released on back in the early 1990s. In this game the player assumes the role of Bart Simpson who, while walking through the Springfield Elementary Science Fair, stumbles onto a virtual reality machine. Like the cool dude he is, Bart decides to give it a try, and that's pretty much the set up for the game. The VR machine is actually a wheel-like torture device that Bart is placed in and then spun. The wheel is adorned with various level icons and whichever one Bart's heads is pointing towards when the wheel stops is the level he must complete. The levels vary in theme and gameplay style, but each start/end with a brief cutscene and also contain a brief cutscene should if they are failed.[CR]Like previous games in based upon the Simpsons license such as Bart vs The Space Mutants and Bart's Nightmare the game is infamous for it's high degree of difficulty. One notable example is the waterslide level where the only way to choose the correct path (Besides luck) is to follow a faint arrow that appears on another swimmers shirt. This is never explained to the player and even knowing this the arrow is still hard to spot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level in Virtual Bart consists of a different gameplay style and mechanic and are discussed in more detail below. Level names slightly embellished to add flavor.Dino Bart[CR]Bart assumes the role of a dinosaur and must fight off prehistoric versions of Springfieldians while climbing Mt. Springfield in what is otherwise a very typical side-scrolling platformer level.Baby Bart[CR]Now Bart reverts back into his child-like self and goes about exploring Springfield in his own devil-may-care-with-a-diaper sort of way. Again, this is another side-scroller with a heavier reliance on skilled jumps.Piggy Bart[CR]The final side-scroller of the game, Piggy Bart has now turned Bart into a pig who must escape the Krusty Klown Pork Factory with all of his porky brethren. This time though, he'll have to deal in a more maze-like side-scroller gathering keys and avoiding guards.Bart vs. Mt. Splashmore[CR]A Mode-7 feast for the eyes as Bart rides down a water slide at Mt.Splashmore. Gameplay consists of guiding Bart down the slide in a race against time avoiding other swimmers and where taking the wrong turn could result in precious lost seconds or instant death.Bart vs. The Class Photo[CR]In an effort to avoid taking a class picture, Bart hides out behind the bushes at Springfield Elementary and throws tomatoes and eggs at his classmates (since if they're all messy, they can't take the picture, naturally). With limited ammunition, each shot must count, and hitting teachers or other non-children (while they're not distracted anyways) results in an instant game over.Mad Bart: Beyond Thunderdome[CR]This game is a clear homage to Road Rash and Mad Max. In it, Bart is in a destroyed Springfield after the nuclear power plant finally melted down due to the workers' incompetence, and now he must drive his motorcycle to his home while avoiding various hazards and other drivers. The school bullies take up their role as antagonists, and, like Mt. Splashmore, Bart has only a limited amount of health and time in order to complete his mission.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Press the following at the title screen, or by pausing the game for the desired affect.

Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through.

The game later received a Famicom Disk System port, also titled Wardner no Mori, and eventually a Sega Genesis port. The Sega Genesis port was released in 1991, and was known as Wardner in all territories, except for Japan. Wardner was developed by Toaplan. The game follows Dover, a young magician, on his quest to destroy the evil Wardner. Wardner kidnaps Dover's girlfriend, Mia, while they are visiting the town of Niknik, so it's up to Dover to save Mia and overthrow Wardner once and for all. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] Dover sets out on his quest.     Wardner is a traditional action platformer. Dover's primary method of attacking is by throwing a fireball, which destroys most enemies in one hit. The game has six stages, ranging from various forest locales, to Wardner's fortress. Each stage has a boss, who possess improved abilities and health compared to the normal enemies of each level.  At the end of each stage, Dover has the opportunity to purchase upgrades, using the money accrued throughout the preceding level. Power-ups include the power of the moon, clocks, musical instruments, and improved jumping capabilities.    [CR]",

                "plot": "Warrior of Rome 2 is a real time war simulation strategy game.[CR]Released in '93 till date there is nothing comparable to what it has achieved. Set in the backdrop of the Roman Empire's heyday it tells the story of Caesar and his famous battles.[CR]The game plays like hardly any other game ever made making it strikingly unique. Two armies face each other on a set map and are allowed to construct there own formation of useful buildings while at the same time fighting each other off and growing in skill level. As units gain experience from battles they improve their combat function, speed of movement, building skills, sailing skills, depending of course on what they have been experiencing. If a unit gets killed all of its experience gets lost along with it so the skill balance then tips in favor of the opposing army. If this happens too much a very balanced war then turns into a rout with the quickness. Controlling each unit is done with a host of specific commands allowing you to have pin point control over the movements of your units. You can have your units attack any structure from a peasant's house to the enemies main fortress or move to any point on the map you choose.[CR]Having total control over the movements allows you to micro manage all aspects of your war strategy keeping in mind the bigger picture of what is going on on the map in general. This game plays like nothing else out there.[CR]The story is that of Caesar which has been told many times by Shakespeare in his semi historical play. The only difference here is the ending and the fact that you follow Caesar step by step until he reaches Rome. The ending is a shocker for those of you familiar with the story of Caesar and I won't give it away here because that would be a spoiler of sorts. The symphonic soundtrack feels as though it was written especially for the many moments of suspension and tension through out the game as the story unfolds setting the mood perfectly.[CR]Graphically this game performs on a very high level. The units develop different animations based on there skill levels. If the unit is specialized in speed it gets a horse. If it really is good at speed it gets a imperial white horse. If the unit is specialized in combat it gets a shield and sword but if it is better at aerial attacks it walks around with a bow and arrow. One of the most impressive animations are the volley animations when arrows or napalm are flying around they are executed with a fluidity that is impressive.[CR]As for sound and music this game had some sort of master working on it.[CR]Even though the music loops every 90 seconds it never gets old and it is composed to fit the atmosphere of the game, sort of old school music and it sets the mood perfectly for what goes on as the game develops.[CR]The re-playability of this game is astounding. Mostly due to the 2 player mode that has 44 maps to select from, each one demonstrating a unique complexion of geography that makes you think and evaluate strategy on different levels. The 2 player mode is where this game really shines because the a.i. of this game is the only weak link. complex strategies that develop as you understand how this game functions are never executed by the a.i. but going up against a human player there is no limit to the combinations of strategies that will get played out against each side, creating some of the most outrageous scenarios you could imagine.[CR]My final recommendation is that it takes time to learn how to play this game because of the depth and the unique control scheme that most video game players will find themselves unfamiliar with but once you have figured out how this game works you will realize that this is definitely a masterpiece.[CR](On a side note Warrior Of Rome 3 was released on the Super Nintendo in Japan and uses the same game engine as 2 except it is upgraded a little bit and has a new story. This is probably the most rare game for that system only 500 of them were printed due to financial constraints of the publisher. Considering how good 2 is 3 is probably real good if someone could find it that would be cool. As for now no one knows where a copy is.)[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Tug of war mode -[CR]To access a secret tug of war mode, start a new game, and press start.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story starts with Castle Baltia being attacked by a force known as the Dalsis Empire.[CR]The King of Baltia orders that his son Garrett, flee before the invading army lead by Lord Geryon can capture him. Garrett only had a small handful of men and his bodyguard, Sword Master Baldarov, set off to find help to beat back Geryon's forces.[CR]After escaping the castle Garrett meets Mina on the road to Sulras. While getting to town the group is attack by a group of theives, Garrett and Baldarov defeated the theives and got Mina to town safely. At Sulras Garrett talks with Duke Carleon, telling him what has happened in Baltia. Carleon tells Garrett to rest for the night. That night Sulras is attacked by a group of theives looking for revenge for their fallen comrades. Garrett, Baldarov, and Carleon's bodyguard Throne fight off the enemy while Mina got the townpeople to the church for safety. After the theives were defeated Sabra, one of the king's fighters, gets to town, telling Garrett that the castle has fallen and his father stayed to fight the enemy alone. Garrett decides to go back to the castle to take it back.[CR]On the way back to Baltia Castle Garrett, Baldarov, and Sabra are attacked by evil slimes. Their forces have no way to fight back and are almost done for until Mina and Throne show up with troops and guardsmen with torches, killing off any slimes. Throne tells Garrett that the Duke has told him to follow Garrett's orders and to help him get Baltia Castle back. Mina also says she will join Garrett, not taking no for an answer.[CR]With new forces Garrett is almost back to Baltia when he is attacked by Lance and his forces. After a long battle Lance retreats before he could be killed. While the enemy retreats one of Lance's men shoots Baldarov, killing him. Garrett's swears revenge and marches onwards to Baltia castle.[CR]He gets to Baltia Castle to see the man who attack it, Geryon, sitting on the throne. Garrett and his forces charge upon the castle. After a long battle Garrett defeats Geryon. After his defeat court mage Calais and Crocodile Knight Tiberon are freed. Calais tells Garrett that the attack was done so that the Dalsis Empire could steal the great sword, Warsong. The sword has an evil power within. Garrett decides right then to attack the Dalsis Empire.[CR]As Garrett is about to attack the Dalsis Empire he gets word that Baltia's fortress, Anzel, is under attack by the Dalsis forces that were retreating from being defeated at Baltia Castle. Garrett and his forces go to the fortress and see that a small force under the command of Bayard are all that is keeping the fortress from falling. Garrett sees that Lance and Dalsis general Momus are the ones attacking the fortress. Garrett's forces fight their way into the fortress, killing Momus and defeating Lance (who escapes again) and save Bayard. Garrett has Bayard join his group for the attack on Dalsis. A scout tells Garrett of Dalsis forces retreating. Garrett gives the order to give chase.[CR]After defeating the remaining forces Baltia starts it's attack on Dalsis. But by the time Garrett and his forces make it to the border they see that Dalsis' leader, Pythion, has set up defences along the river Worth. After a long battle across the river and through the Castle Valk Garret is joined by Duke Carleon and his forces. Together the Baltia forces march onto Castle Dalsis. Once there they fight into the castle. Lance once again shows up, attacking Garrett. Lance acts confused as to why Baltia is attacking Dalsis. Garrett explains that Dalsis stole Warsong and they are trying to get it back. Lance escapes again when Garrett's forces make it to the center of the castle.[CR]Baltia's forces find out that Pythion is in what is known as the Twin Castles. Garrett and his allies make their way though and attack Pythion. Pythion tries to explain that he is the only one with the power to control Warsong and unite the world under his rule. Garrett tells him he is wrong but has no choice but to kill Pythion, getting the sword back from evil.[CR]On the way home to Baltia, Garrett and his allies come across a runied city populated by stone statues. Soon monsters attack. After awhile they find that Lance was turned to stone. After freeing him and defeating the creatures he joins Garrett, but only so he can settle his score with him later.[CR]As they try to get back to Baltia Garrett's forces are attacked by evil creatures, and a great dragon who is after Warsong. After a long battle the dragon is wounded. Garrett commands that they kill it before it heals and chase it into the valley of Allenst. After a long journey in the valley they find a sword called the Dragon Slayer and use it to kill the dragon. After the dragon's death they find a stone carved with the story about how a knight named Ganelon brought evil to the land but Galafron of Elthlead used Warsong to defeat the great evil. From the stone Garrett and his forces head to Seneferia, the forbidden land[CR]After a long journey they make it to Seneferia. Once there they are attacked by an wizard named Naxos. After killing him they make their way to an underground passage. At this point Lance leaves them. As Garrett and allies make their way thought the passage they are attacked by another wizard named Mortimus, who is the brother of Naxos. He tries to get revenge on Garrett but fails and is defeated. One of Garrett's men finds a set of stairs and the team go down.[CR]Once down in the cave they see the ancient knight Ganelon has started to bring the evil back. Garrett and team attack but it is too late. Ganelon summons the great evil, Chaos. As Garrett and allies defeat Ganelon Chaos tells Garrett that Chaos is needed to balance the world. Lance comes and helps with this final battle and appairs to die. Chaos is sealed away and the battle is over. Garrett and crew escape the tunnel before is caves is. In the end Garrett wonders if Chaos was telling the truth about balance.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Items (Japanese Version)[CR]When recruiting soldiers or equipping items Hold [B]Up-Left + A + B[/B] and Garett must be highlighted as well.

It is similar to R-Type, albeit, never achieving the same amount of success. The game is the sole entry in the franchise, despite the popularity of side scrolling shooters in the era.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As with most games of this type, the story is light and inconsequential. In the year 2222 AD three ships set out from Earth on an exploratory mission. Five years later (2227 AD, the year in which the events of the game take place), the ships are presumed lost. Their final transmission was \"We are approaching the planet Voltegeus...\" (The planet's name is also spelt as Voltegas). Soon after a Voltegian fleet materializes near Mars, spurring the action in the game. Two informal subtitles exist for the game, both which reference the story elements: \"Whip Rush: Mystery of the planet Voltegas\" and \"Whip Rush 2222 AD: The Invasion of the Voltegians\". As noted above, however, the second subtitle can be considered incorrect, due to the invasion happening five years after 2222 AD. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Whip Rush is a standard side scrolling space shooter. The level scrolls from right to left and the player's ship can move freely within space as it scrolls by. As the level scrolls, enemies and obstacles are encountered.Like other games in the genre, Whip Rush features an upgrade system, in which four different weapons are available: laser, missile, fireball, and power claw. Each weapon can be upgraded three times.Whip Rush is notable for providing variable speeds when controling your ship, allowing for finer control when moving amongst enemies and obstacles.The amount of lives given to the player at the beginning of the game depends on the difficulty setting.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Whip Rush, developed by Vic Tokai and published by Renovation Products is an early Mega Drive/Sega Gensis side scrolling shooter. It is similar to R-Type, albeit, never achieving the same amount of success. The game is the sole entry in the franchise, despite the popularity of side scrolling shooters in the era.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As with most games of this type, the story is light and inconsequential. In the year 2222 AD three ships set out from Earth on an exploratory mission. Five years later (2227 AD, the year in which the events of the game take place), the ships are presumed lost. Their final transmission was \"We are approaching the planet Voltegeus...\" (The planet's name is also spelt as Voltegas). Soon after a Voltegian fleet materializes near Mars, spurring the action in the game. Two informal subtitles exist for the game, both which reference the story elements: \"Whip Rush: Mystery of the planet Voltegas\" and \"Whip Rush 2222 AD: The Invasion of the Voltegians\". As noted above, however, the second subtitle can be considered incorrect, due to the invasion happening five years after 2222 AD. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Whip Rush is a standard side scrolling space shooter. The level scrolls from right to left and the player's ship can move freely within space as it scrolls by. As the level scrolls, enemies and obstacles are encountered.Like other games in the genre, Whip Rush features an upgrade system, in which four different weapons are available: laser, missile, fireball, and power claw. Each weapon can be upgraded three times.Whip Rush is notable for providing variable speeds when controling your ship, allowing for finer control when moving amongst enemies and obstacles.The amount of lives given to the player at the beginning of the game depends on the difficulty setting.[CR]",

It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.[CR]Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, \"...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing\".[CR]",

Monster Lair retains the gameplay of the first Wonder Boy (which also became the basis for Adventure Island), presenting a side-scrolling platformer/brawler in which the player had to continually keep their energy up with food.[CR]Wonder Boy III was originally developed for the Arcades like its forebears, releasing in the November of 1988 in Japan. It later saw a conversion for the PC Engine CD-ROM/TurboGrafx-CD by Alfa System and Hudson, and the Sega Mega Drive (in Japan and Europe only) courtesy of Sega. Both the TurboGrafx-CD and Mega Drive versions of the game were added to the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, in 2007 and 2009 respectively.[CR]The game is not to be confused with the other Wonder Boy III, Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap. The Dragon's Trap was an original game for the Sega Master System (and later ported to the Game Gear) and is an open-world game akin to Metroid or Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shooting sequences were new to the series[CR]Monster Lair plays like a platformer and shooter. The game stays similar to previous Wonder Boys because the titular character runs from left to right losing health as time passes. As Wonder Boy loses health he collects fruit in order to regain stamina and progress through the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] diverges from previous Wonder Boys in the shooting sequences. Certain levels will have Wonder Boy riding atop of dragons and other monsters, and the goal is to shoot all enemies on screen. Health in the shooting levels is only lost once hit, rather than continuously, but the player can still collect fruit for health. The shooting levels can best be compared to side-scrolling arcade shooters. All boss encounters are on shooting levels, and the shooting sequences are featured often in the game.[CR]",

The 1994 World Cup mascot, a brown soccer-playing dog named Striker, features heavily in the game's menus and box art. The game was released on almost every home computer and console active in 1994. This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.[CR]The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games).

Its premise was that a scientist named Dr. Brown created a time machine and used it to organize a martial arts tournament for various historical fighters. Many of the fighters are based on historical figures and fictional characters. The game was mainly dismissed due to its similarities with                        Street Fighter II, but received a cult following that spawned three sequels. The game also debuts the two ninjas,                      Hanzo and                     Fuuma (who are similar in terms of                    Ryu and                   Ken), who later returned in                  NeoGeo Battle Coliseum.  The game was ported to the                SNES in 1993 by                 SunSoft, which is considered the best version due to the ability to use a five-button configuration instead of three (Two for punches, two for kicks, and either shoulder button for throwing) while improving button response and retaining everything about the original version. The game was also ported to the               Sega Genesis in 1994 by              Sega, which is considered one of the worst Neo Geo conversions of all time. The original version was released for the            Neo Geo CD with an arranged soundtrack in 1995 and the           Wii Virtual Console on September 28, 2007. The game was also included in the          World Heroes Anthology compilation for the         PlayStation 2 and an unlockable game in the        SNK Arcade Classics V.1 compilation for the PlayStation 2,       PlayStation Portable, and      Wii. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World Heroes plays like a traditional 2D fighter, using three attack buttons. (one for punches, one for kicks, and one for throws) Holding down the punch or kick button makes the attack stronger while simply tapping the button gives a quick strike.  The game also featured Death Match mode, which significantly changed the arena to include gameplay obstacles. Arenas could have mines or slippery oil covering parts of the arena. The edges of the arenas could even have electric beams or spiked walls. [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]    Hanzo (based on Hanzo Hattori)    Fuuma (based on Fuma Kotaro)    Kim Dragon (based on    Bruce Lee)    Janne D'Arc (based on    Joan of Arc)                                 Julius Carn (based on                                   Genghis Khan)    Muscle Power (based on    Hulk Hogan)    Brocken    Rasputin (based on Grigori Rasputin)                                         Geegus (boss, based on                                T-1000)[CR]Critical Reception[CR]   When released for the SNES Electronic Gaming Monthly Assigned scores of 8,6,6 and 6 with Ed Semrad writing, \"...The best part of this game is the death match, where anything goes.  It would be nice if there was blood when you hit the spikes though.  The play control is good for most of the fighters and the only down point is that it plays slow.  Fighting fans who can't afford a Neo will be happy with this one\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See the game designers faces[CR]When you get a high score, enter JJJ as your initials.

Starring Disney mascots Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, the game is considered to be a sequel to two Sega-developed games: Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse and QuackShot starring Donald Duck.[CR]While preparing for a magic show, Mickey and Donald encounter a mysterious magic box and enter it, which transports them into a mysterious magical world ruled by a powerful magician. Up to two players can guide Mickey and Donald through the hostile world, as they learn new magic tricks in order to find and defeat the magician.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World of Illusion is a standard platformer game; Mickey and Donald can run, jump and attack enemies using their capes (which turns them into harmless animals or objects, such as a dove or a playing card, though it varies by enemy). A new magic spell is learned by defeating the boss of each level, allowing the pair to advance to and progress through the next level.[CR]This game features the, at the time, popular password save system, but instead of using a combination letters and numbers, the player selects from the 4 different suites in a deck of cards to continue.[CR]One feature that was unique at the time was how levels changed slightly depending on if the player chose a single-player game with Mickey or Donald, or if they chose the two-player game. For example, in the two-player mode, Mickey and Donald would have to support each other to get through the level by jumping on each other to reach high places, then using a rope to hoist up the person who one who was used as a stepping stone, or through Mickey pulling Donald through tight crawlspaces, as he couldn't fit through them, although this would cause structural damage to the area and end up changing part of the next stage. This also affects the single-player mode, as Mickey could fit through the crawlspaces with ease, however Donald would have to find another way around.LevelsStage 1: Enchanted ForestThis first stage takes place in a giant forest where Mickey and Donald will face enormous insects, all the while, wild weeds shoot up from the ground and leaves dance around as they progress. An emphasis on jumping on flowers and using  magic on plants will be sure to bring a few surprises. Later, a hallow log will lead the duo to a underground lair filled with spiders.Stage 2: Among the CloudsThis level features the player's character summoning a magical carpet to ride through the majority of this level, but be cognizant and dodge those vultures and whirling cyclones. They'll land high on the rocks, and will be back to a standard platforming sequence where the character will have to dodge lightening, bouncing boulders, rushing rivers, and more which makes progression tricky. Make sure to take a dance on the piano keyboard, and watch out!Stage 3: Underwater AdventureConjure a magical diving bubble suit and go for a swim! Dodge Snapping Tiger Fish, and don't get stuck on spiny Sea Urchins. Lure shy clams into opening the way to secret passages. Explore a sunken pirate ship, being mindful of falling tridents and watching for sharks!Stage 4: The LibraryJump out of a fish bowl and into a room with giant books and jars. This library is equipped wit all of the majors staples of a library including a springy stapler, rulers, jars of gumballs, cork boards. But be weary of enemies such as; tacks, stamps, flying pens and pencils. As the duo progresses, they will slide down a piece of furniture to the base of an inviting cookie jar - what's inside? Hop in an take a look, they might just find a galaxy awaits their exploration.Stage 5: The Magic BoxThe duo has found the home of the Magic Master, a wonderland of which even Alice would approve of. This is going to be the biggest challenge yet. It will take special Magic and wise choices to make their way through the mazes that lead to the Magic Master and the final duel! Will Mickey and Donald beat him and make it back home in time for the big magic show? Enemies in this level include animated playing cards, statues, Chandeliers, dinnerware, flying witches, jesters and many more.Magic SpellsMagic Carpet (Level 1): This allows Mickey and Donald to fly on a magic carpet in level 2.Underwater Bubble (Level 2): This allows Mickey and Donald to breathe underwater.Magic Box Transportation (Level 3): This allows Mickey and Donald to transport to different places using magic boxes.Card Control (Level 4): This allows Mickey and Donald to manipulate playing cards so they could form bridges over wide gaps.[CR]",

It is also possible to Run by pressing Light Punch and Light Kick together.[CR]The main game consists of the player choosing to go after the Intercontinental title or the World Wrestling Federation Title.

                "plot": "Summary[CR]Magneto gets control of the Danger Room computers and turns routine simulations into deadly games. The game consists of four playable characters ( Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and Gambit) and five support characters ( Rogue, Storm, Iceman, Archangel and Jean Grey) as you battle against constantly intensifying danger room simulations. The heroes, with the help of Professor Xavier, try to regain control of their surroundings, eventually facing Magneto in 'real life' on his asteroid base.Levels[CR]The Savage Land (Boss Characters : Juggernaut and Zaldane)[CR]The Shi'ar Empire (Boss Character : Deathbird) Using Nightcrawler's teleport, vast sections of this level can be skipped.[CR]Light House (Boss Characters: Sabretooth, Juggernaut and Apocalypse) Using Nightcrawler's teleport, vast amounts of this level can be skipped.[CR]Post Apocalyptic World (Boss Character : Ahab)[CR]Mojo's Crunch (Boss Character : Mojo) At the end of this level, after you destroy the computer, you actually have to push the reset button on the Sega Genesis. This makes it impossible to beat if your reset button is stuck (which was the case with my Genesis) or if you are playing it on a different system.[CR]Asteroid M (Boss Character : Magneto) Using Nightcrawler's teleport, a significant portion of this level can be skipped.Bosses[CR]Juggurnaut : To defeat Juggernaut, dodge his charge and hit him in the face when he stops. If you are not on ground level he will stomp which will drop you down from any ledge you are on. My strategy was to use Nightcrawler or Wolverine and wait for him to charge a half screen away. Dodge his charge and do a jumping attack (with Nightcrawler) or a special jumping attack (with Wolverine). This should propel you behind Juggernaut, and if you were a half screen away there should be plenty of space behind him to avoid his next charge.[CR]Zaldane : Zaldane charges up an energy ball attack and jumps away when you get close. Just avoid the energy attack and hit her when she jumps or lands.[CR]Deathbird : Dodge her when she jumps or fires and hit her when she lands.[CR]Sabretooth : Hit him when he ducks. To get him to duck just stand under him and in front of him a little. He will start his downward lunging attack and when he does he is vulnerable. When using Nightcrawler, it is best to use his special ability to attack Sabertooth rather than his jumping attack given that his jumping attack can possibly propel him into a vulnerable position.[CR]Apocalypse : He can be beat very quickly simply using Nightcrawler's special ability. Just press 'A' when he comes to hit you and he will take damage. Otherwise you have to let him charge up, get close to him, jump away, and then let him charge down before you attack him.[CR]Mojo : This area is designed so you can use the platforms to jump over Mojo, but this is only necessary with Gambit. All other characters can simply jump over him and hit him in the base of the tail to cause damage. Most easily done with Nightcrawler's jumping attack or Wolverine's super jumping attack. After defeating Mojo you have to restart the console to continue to the next level. If you failed to restart the console you would lose and be sent to the opening screen.[CR]Magneto : Magneto is a difficult boss, to defeat him you must dodge his attacks and then hit him when he shoots his magnetic beam at you.Critical Reception[CR]When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version the scores of 6,7,6,8 stating, \"...I wish there were more characters to choose from. The music and sounds are simply repeated noises from other Sega games... The switching of the X-men characters during the game is cool and the variety of special moves are also welcome. The game is very choppy and the control needs work\".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extending the downtime in the Danger Room[CR]There is a machine in the upper right corner of the Danger Room. Destroying it will greatly extend the time in between stages. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extending the downtime in the Danger Room[CR]Enable the ''Level select'' code.Select two-player mode.Hold Down+A+C. Remove the controller from port one and plug it into port two.Press Start.Select characters,a starting level,and begin game play.Press Start(2)for full life.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extending the downtime in the Danger Room[CR]Hold Down + A + C and then press (or switch) power on the Genesis. With those buttons held, hold Start when the ''Press Start'' text appears on the opening screen. Continue to hold the buttons until the difficulty selection screen appears. [CR]Select any difficulty level and character, and walk to the right when the game play starts. Eight panels representing the eight game levels will appear on the wall. Crouch in front of a panel and press C to jump to the corresponding level. [CR]Note: This code will not work if a controller is plugged into port two.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]X-Men 2 does not have any recognizable ties to the story of the original game, save for some characters that were present in the first game as well. In the game, a techno-organic race of aliens named the Phalanx invade (or according to the game manual, return) to Earth in order to take control of its inhabitants by assimilation. Most of the X-Men have been captured, except for Wolverine, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, The Beast, Psylocke, and Gambit, who have avoided capture and are trying to rescue both the other X-men and save the world. Along the way, the X-Men rescue their old arch-nemesis, Magneto, and, in a surprising turn of events, he joins them in their quest to defend the world from the Phalanx aggression.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Initially, the player can play as any one of the six aforementioned X-Men. The game does not allow the player to select a character at the beginning, but rather thrusts the player in with a randomly selected character. Each character can jump, attack, and use their respective mutant power. Some characters, like Wolverine and Psylocke, can double-jump, while others, such as Cyclops, can charge up their power for an even more devastating version. Unlike the previous game, there is no set meter for the mutant power, allowing the player to instead use it as much as they like. If the player's character remains at full health, they become stronger than normal, and their mutant power reflects their additional level of strength. The six playable X-Men in the game are:Beast - Most of his attacks are all physical strength. When he has 9 or 10 bars of health, his special attack allows him to send shock waves to the to his surroundings as he slams the ground.Psylocke - Her special attack is using her arm to shock people. Once you get full health the range to shock people is slightly longer.Gambit - Gambit's special attack allows him to fire a kinetic card at an enemy. He can shoot 2 or 3 if the player charges the attack by holding down the button, or if he has full health.Cyclops - His special is shooting laser out of his eyes, and if the player holds the special button down or has full health he will shoot a laser with a wider range.Wolverine - Uses his adamantium claws to tear up foes, which can inflict bonus damage when at full health. Wolverine also has some minor health regeneration abilities when not in combat and is able to climb walls using his claws.Nightcrawler - His mutant ability is teleporting and appearing somewhere else on screen depending on the direction you press the d-pad, the distance of his teleport can be increased by holding the mutant power button down longer. With full health or by charging the attack by holding down the button, Nightcrawler can damage enemies that are in the immediate vicinity of his teleportation. and is able to scale walls.Magneto (Becomes available after defeating him in level 3) - Magneto can shoot electromagnetic balls, and also has the ability to levitate.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]In the original Genesis release, there was a minor glitch in some copies of the game that made the player start with Beast on the first level, rather than choosing a character at random.The game's soundtrack was composed by Kurt Harland, of the electronica band Information Society. Some levels featured different soundtrack elements depending on the character selected although the basic structure of the level's musical theme remained the same.The European release of the game re-used the cover art from a game gear X-Men game, X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fight Phalanx-Magneto in the Last Level[CR]What you need to do is defeat all the Phalanx X-Men clones except for one.  It doesn\\'t matter what order you do it in just so long as all but one are dead.  Now, once you\\'ve done that, head back down to the very bottom of the area -- the end of the hallway where the Phalanx mech\\'s claws turned into your character(s).  Now, hit the wall to the left.  If you do this, the wall should emit a circle of explosions which circle around twice and into a sort of close-eyed blank-looking smiley face.(Looks like this -&gt; -_-)  Now, head back up into the second room from the bottom on the right.  This room should have a wall blocking your progression.  However, if you did as I said, if you hit this small wall, it should shatter like glass.  Walk into the room, and there, you will fight Phalanx-Magneto![CR][B]Note[/B]:  This does not effect the ending.  It is just a nifty little bonus for those of you who like to explore.",

She lead a team of elite X-Perts to do impossible missions. The game was a mixture of action, adventure and strategy.[CR]X-Perts was set in an futuristic underwater research lab called AQUA, besieged by terrorists. The player controlled 3 characters, each with unique fighting moves and specific skill knowledge. All characters and backgrounds were pre-rendered in 3D, to give it a very high end graphic look.[CR]The player had to react to events happening in the lab to progress the game and avoid destruction, while battling both the terrorists and the stations defenses.[CR]This was done by direct and indirect control of the X-Perts through the entire lab (roughly 20 different levels.) The player used a special RECOM screen to monitor his characters placement across the separate areas of the lab, as well as all mission objectives, enemies, facility robots and other hazards.[CR]Using direct control of a character, you would move around and between levels and directly combat enemies. The player could also activate tasks for mission objectives. The time it took to complete a task was based on the strength of their Engineering and or Computer Science skills.[CR]Missions were constantly being generated and some were time dependent (missing it usually meant the situation got worse for the X-Perts), so hopping between X-Perts and assigning the ones with the best skills for the task was important. Some secondary missions allowed character upgrades to their personal weapons.[CR]Characters could also use 3 unique torture moves each to get information from the enemies instead of killing them. This would sometimes be needed for mission objectives. However, if not executed properly, it would instantly kill the enemy instead.[CR]The game modeled all 20 levels of the lab in real time, so even when you left a character to activate another, it would still continue to perform its task until it was attacked by enemies, and would automatically defend itself, but to a lesser extent then if you directly controlled it.[CR]The game was broken down into chapters (save points) and each chapter remembered the status of the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded areas, broken power grids, hacked computers, active forcefields.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Restore Health and Ammo[CR]At the title screen, press A, B, A,  Left, Mode, Up, Right.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in the Ys series. Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys I & II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two had heard rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.[CR]Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. These console ports all received English localizations.[CR]Ys III would be remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for the PC in 2005. It follows the same story, but uses the engine from Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. Its PSP and 2012 Steam re-release versions were localized into English by XSEED.[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, \"...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game\".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I & II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.[CR]As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points ( TGCD) or not ( SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights.[CR]",

It is also one of the harder Treasure games to track down, along with Radiant Silvergun, due to its rarity and exclusivity: the game was never released in Europe or the US, but did have a limited release in Brazil.[CR]Despite being a licensed game, great care was put into its mechanics to set it apart from the herd of Street Fighter clones. It borrows Fatal Fury's plane-switching mechanic (which would later appear in future Treasure games like Guardian Heroes) that allows fighters to evade and maneuver around opponents. The game also allows for up to four players simultaneously, with team and free-for-all options.[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Open The Debug Mode[CR]At the title screen (echo \"press start button\"),hold a & b & c buttons,then press start button , move the cursor to \"option\" item, last hold start & a & b & c buttons untils the option screen displayed, release all the buttons, you 'll find in the bottom of the option list, add another one, enable it.[CR]Then entry the game, on play mode select screen, 1-2 & 1-3 mode has been opened.",

                "plot": "Based on the manga/anim series Yu Yu Hakusho. This is a story of a teenager delinquent Yuusuke Urameshi, who was hit by a car while trying to save a child. However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an \"occult detective\" and to fight against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.[CR]You must play the individual chapters of the four playable characters (Yuusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei), until in the final chapter you control them all in the ultimate confrontation against evil forces. The game is a Japanese-style adventure (no puzzles, menu-driven interface) with the addition of battles. The battles are real time; similarly to fighting games, you can kick, punch, defend, and use special techniques. Unlike most Japanese adventures, you view the game world from platform-like third person perspective (although you cannot move physically in adventure mode).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Have all the characters with you[CR]Beat the stories of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama and Hiei. Now, instead of selecting a character before starting the game, you'll be able to select any of the 4 main characters only before the battle sequences!",

Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zombies Ate My Neighbors (simply Zombies in Europe and Australia) is a top-down action shooter developed by Lucasarts. The game takes place during some unspecified event that has caused zombies and a whole host of other B-movie style monsters to run amok in a suburban setting. Alone or in two-player co-op, players have to roam a huge number of levels killing monsters and rescuing their innocent neighbors.[CR]The game was originally published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis on September 1993. On October 26, 2009, it was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player begins by selecting either Zeke or Julie, and in co-op, the player that they don't choose is controlled by player two. Gameplay is top-down, with fairly simple controls. Players can have one weapon and one item selected at any time, and scroll through these as needed. Most levels see the player dropped into an environment with the objective of rescuing a certain number of survivors. Survivors are stationary, and often placed in hard-to-reach areas. The player has a GPS-like radar that can be activated, displaying the number of survivors remaining and their location when sufficiently close. When the player runs into a survivor, that survivor is deemed as 'saved' and disappears. When no survivors remain in a level, a freestanding exit door appears next to the player, who can choose to further explore or exit the level. Survivors are killed if they are attacked by an enemy; a loud cry alerts the player to a death and an angel floats up from the survivor as part of the death animation. If the player fails to rescue a specified number of survivors, they fail the level.[CR]The environment and enemies vary largely from level to level. Some levels see players facing only one kind of enemy, while others force them to deal with waves of different enemies. Locations range from suburban backyards and shopping malls to horror clich\u00e9s like castles and pyramids. Each level's number and name is displayed before the level begins. These titles are often done in B-movie style and reflect the content of the level: for example, Level 12: Mars Needs Cheerleaders features only Martians as enemies and only Cheerleaders as survivors.Julie in one of Mall levels[CR]Different enemy classes are vulnerable to different attacks. Whilst low-level enemies like zombies will succumb to almost anything, other enemies are more vulnerable to certain weapons, and may be immune to some attacks. This vulnerability is usually referencing popular myth or fiction on the subject; Werewolves are most vulnerable to thrown silverware, for example. Other vulnerabilities are less grounded in logic; Martians, for example, are most vulnerable to tomatoes.[CR]Weapons are found in the environment, and most are everyday objects. The basic weapon is the squirt gun, which the player always starts with. Other weapons include foodstuffs, such as Icepops, and tools, such as the weedwacker. More far-fetched weapons are also found in certain situations. Killing a Martian will force him to drop his Bubble Gun, whilst the Pandora's Box item can be found in pyramids. Levels contain chests, cupboards, and similar that can be opened to find weapons and items. Most levels contain locked doors, which have to be opened with a Key or otherwise bypassed. A Key works on any door, but can only be used once. Occasionally, levels contain Skeleton Doors, which can only be opened with a much rarer Skeleton Key. Environments also contain destructible walls, which can be identified by the cracks in them. These can be opened with a sufficiently strong attack, such as a Bazooka, or by tricking a sufficiently strong enemy into destroying it.[CR]Items are usually less attack-based than weapons, and have a range of effects. Med Kits restore health, and Keys open doors. Decoy Clowns are inflatable laughing toys that distract all enemies in the area. Speed Boots give the player increased speed for a short period. There are also several potions; one turns the player into a fearsome invulnerable monster for a short period, one turns the player into a ghost who can walk past enemies unharmed and undetected for a short time.[CR]Most levels do not actually require the player to kill enemies. The player can run faster than most enemies, and evasion is as viable a tactic as firepower. Certain situations do force the player into combat, however, such as the level that forces the player to take down an extremely powerful Giant Baby to obtain the Skeleton Key required to rescue the level's lone survivor.Zeke in one of the Suburbs levels[CR]The player has a life bar and a number of extra lives. The life bar is depleted when attacked by enemies or environmental hazards, but can be restored by using the Med Kits that are found throughout the environment. Extra Lives are earned between levels by score. This makes it in the player's best interests to rescue as many survivors as possible, as rescuing all survivors in a level confers a huge bonus. When a health bar is depleted all the way, the player's character sways dizzily and falls over. An extra life is used automatically, and the player's character reappears with a short period of invulnerability. Dying with no extra lives remaining takes the player to a Game Over screen and then returns them to the main menu. After certain levels, a four-character password is given to the players so they may continue from that level in the case a Game Over occurs.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Exit that appears after rescuing all the neighbors.

In order to gain ninja ranking he has to pass six lands. Gremlin has asserted that the name \"Zool\" did not refer to the supernatural entity Zuul from the film Ghostbusters.[CR]The game is a pure arcade platform game, relying on smooth, fast moving gameplay, colorful graphics and a popular soundtrack by Patrick Phelan which overlaps with the Lotus 3 soundtrack and has inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. The game also contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano.[CR]Zool was also ported to the Atari ST, Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive, SNES, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Amiga CD32, PC, Acorn Archimedes and Jaguar. A Zool coin-op was released in 1993 to cash in on the hype surrounding the Amiga release, but was not well distributed and is now not widely remembered. Zool was also ported to the RISC OS platform.[CR]Reviews for the Amiga version of the game were extremely positive, possibly partly because the need was felt for the Amiga to have a flagship game to rival Sonic. However some criticism was aimed at the blatant and pervasive product placement in the game for lollipop company Chupa Chups, in the first three levels (known as 'Sweet Zone'). Another frequent criticism of the game was that it was excessively difficult. Some contemporary reviewers complained of not being able to get further than the second level (Music Zone).[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]- Extra Energy and Time -[CR]B, A, Right, Right, A, C, Up, Down, and A[CR]- Extra Life -[CR]Down, Up, Left, Left, A, Right, and Down [CR]- Stage/Level Skip -[CR]Pause the game and press C, Right, A, B, B, A, Left, Left, A, Right, and Down.

Players must \"zoop\" incoming pieces from the sides of the screen before any can reach the center, eliminating pieces of the same color and switching colors with other pieces.[CR]Most versions of the game were released in the US and Europe. The Sega Saturn is the only exception: the Saturn release was exclusive to Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Zoop's main title screen.[CR]In Zoop players control a small ship that is confined to a small box in the middle of the screen, around the box enemies of various colors try to invade the box. The player's job is to use their ship to shoot like-colored enemies, if players shoot an enemy of a different color, the ship's color changes. The challenge is to swap colors with the right enemies in order to stop all of the approaching enemies. If one of the enemies get's in the ship's box, it's game over.[CR]Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant.[CR]",
