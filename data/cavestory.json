Cave Story features 2D platform mechanics and is reminiscent of the classic games Amaya played in his youth, such as Metroid (1986) and Castlevania (1986). After its initial self-published release, Cave Story slowly gained popularity on the Internet. It received wide critical acclaim for its compelling characters, setting, story and gameplay.",
