The add-on was released in 1991. The Sega CD lets the user play CD-based games and adds extra hardware functionality, such as a faster central processing unit and graphic enhancements. It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs.[CR]Seeking to create an add-on device for the Genesis, Sega developed the unit to read compact discs as its storage medium. The main benefit of CD technology was greater storage capacity, which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than their Genesis cartridge counterparts.[CR]Developer:  Epyx / Atari[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]CPU:  MC68000 @ 12.5 MHz[CR]Memory:  4 Mbit[CR]Graphics:  Custom ASIC[CR]Sound:  Ricoh RF5C164[CR]Display:  320 x 224[CR]Media:  Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  2",

Furthermore it contains fully voiced video cutscenes that explains the current objective, as well as new first person 3D-style stages involving rollerblading and hanggliding, using the same engine as the Mega-CD versions of Cliffhanger and Batman Returns. Hook is presumed to be identical to its regular Mega-CD counterpart.",

Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.[CR]A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.[CR]Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.",

Not all the gods could accept the peaceful co-existence of creatures in Kypros, and Daar, the god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was defeated and sealed by the god of light, Risk. Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is trying to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient prophecy, only eight heroes, the bearers of magic pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes who come from different parts of Kypros, unaware of their great mission. Among those heroes are the young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu tribe Gonza and his little sister Maimai, the beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others. Before the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective. Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique techniques to use in battles. The story and general gameplay of Burai: Hachigyoku no Y\u016bshi Densetsu is similar to those of the original Burai: J\u014dkan for computers; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cutscenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.",

During a test ride with a new machine, however, he is somehow thrown into another dimension. After being rescued there by a group of mecha pilots from vile creatures named Devastators, he learns that nefarious people are working on a connection between that and his own dimension, and sets out to stop them.[CR]Devastator is a run & gun-style platformer with shoot-'em-up segments. The player controls a humanoid mech with a mid-range weapon, which can be described as a sickle on a chain, and one of three different long-range weapons. The goal in each level is simply to reach the end and defeat a boss. Most of levels consist of platforming, but sometimes the gameplay switches to a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Weapons can be upgraded by collecting items left by defeated enemies, similar to the Turrican games, but the protagonist may only have one long-range weapon; picking up another replaces the old one. There is only one type of standard upgrade item. To select a weapon, the player has to shoot the power-up until it shows the correct symbol.",

In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim.

When he is in the air, a waterspout storm forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay to search for his pod, he contacts several dolphins from other pods, who tell him the entire sea is in chaos, and that all marine creatures had felt the storm. After talking to an orca, Ecco travels to the Arctic to find a blue whale named The Big Blue. The Big Blue tells him such storms had been occurring every 500 years and directs him to the Asterite, the oldest creature on Earth. He leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep cavern where he finds the Asterite. Although it has the power to aid him, one of its globes is missing, and needs it returned. However, this can only be achieved by traveling back in time using a machine built by the ancient Atlanteans.[CR]Ecco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers the time machine and an ancient library. He learns the cause of the storm; it was a harvest of Earth's waters that was conducted every 500 years by an alien species known as the Vortex. The Vortex had lost their ability to make their own food, and so every 500 years, they would harvest from the waters of Earth. Learning this, he activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth's past. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Once inside the waterspout, Ecco makes his way towards the Vortex Queen, the leader of the Vortex race. Eventually, the Vortex Queen is destroyed and Ecco rescues his pod.",

It is the first game of the Keio Flying Squadron series with a simple shoot-'em-up style of play.[CR]Gameplay[CR]The game consists of the protagonist Rami riding on top of Spot, who can shoot fireballs at enemies. When Spot is not firing, two smaller dragons (Companion fighters) appear one after another to assist Rami and Spot. The lesser dragons shoot smaller fireballs and can be sacrificed to do larger damage, only to reappear when Spot ceases to shoot.[CR]Release[CR]In Europe, a demo of the first level of this game was provided by Sega Pro magazine. The game seemed to end after the first level, but in fact the whole game was accessible on the disc by using a level-select cheat to skip to the second level, and then continuing through the game.[CR]Reception[CR]Retro Gamer included among top ten Mega CD games, calling it \"a perfectly acceptable substitute\" OF Konami's Parodius that features \"similar style of horizontally scrolling wackiness and puts the Mega-CD hardware to good use to produce some excellent cut-scenes and a brilliant CD-quality soundtrack.",

But the fun thing is that you aren't restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...",

                "plot": "Make My Video- Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch is a video game based on real-time editing of music video footage. The setup is that a brother and sister pair is arguing about what would make the best Marky Mark video. Since they can not agree, they enlist help from some other people- A boxer and his trainer, a trio of teenage girls, the members of a garage band, and their parents. Each group has their ideas about what an ideal Marky Mark video should or should not contain. The specifications normally come in the form of a set of pictures they either do or don't want to see, and perhaps some effects. The game has three Marky Mark videos from which to choose- Good Vibrations, I Need Money, and You Gotta Believe. After receiving the video specifications, the player enters the video editing console in the EditChallenge mode. From this console, the player can view and select between 3 video streams that are playing. The selected stream will be edited into the final video. One stream is the original video while the other 2 feature assorted random footage that nonetheless often carries images that happened to have been specified in the video request. The video editing console also allows the player to apply a variety of real-time filters, such as mosaic and blur filters, RGB color filters, strobe and motion filters, lyric subtitles, among others. Once the video is over and your work is completed, the video is played back in its edited entirety and the requester offers his or her evaluation. The game also allows the user to enter a mode called U-Direct. Rather than being competitive, U-Direct allows the player to use the console to create any type of video and also save the results.",

Joker and crew must fly to the refinery, shooting down enemy tanks and helicopters, then Joker must rappel down to the refinery and rescue the chemist on foot.[CR]The helicopter sections follow a pattern similar to Tomcat Alley, showing brief clips of the cast in the cockpit, followed by a \"nose camera\" shot of an enemy approaching. During this shot, you have the ability to move a set of crosshairs over the enemy and press the \"fire\" button. If you're on target, you are rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and close up footage of models exploding.[CR]The on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras placing you in the \"eyes\" of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in both the helicopter and foot sections.",

To emulate the three-screen setup of the original arcade game (3 288x224 screens arranged in a horizontal line like with the Darius games), porters Aisystem Tokyo simply capped the screen resolution in software, resulting in the entire game running in a small window.[CR]Playable characters are two androids called Kunoichi (female ninja, red color) and Ninja (male ninja, blue color). Both characters play identically.[CR]As indicated by the boxart, one of the game's main selling points was the soundtrack composed by Taito's inhouse band Zuntata. The game includes both the arcade versions's soundtrack as well as remixed tracks. An exclusive Zuntata mode was also included, which is bascially a movie scene that explains the game's backstory. Members of Zuntata served as actors.[CR]To this day, this is the most faithful port of The Ninja Warriors.",

The game consists of 10 levels set in the prehistoric age. Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.",

Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.",

It was developed by Japanese company Compile[3] and released on February 23, 1996 in Japan only as both the last Mega-CD game released in Japan and the last game released anywhere on the Mega-CD/Sega CD.[CR]The game has a cartoonish manga-based visual style; it is loosely based on a contemporary Japanese manga series which was based on the Shadowrun franchise. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games which are set in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game is set entirely in Japan. In the fictional Shadowrun setting, Japan maintains a practice of exiling all orcs and trolls; thus there are no characters of those races in this game. Setting it apart is the combat system, turn-based rather than action-based, and six-sided dice appear rolling on the screen to determine the results of combat--the conflict resolution system used in the Shadowrun table-top game.",

Though the basic gameplay is rather typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the focus of the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation of items makes it comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.",

Players are given a plot of land and are tasked with buying (and creating) rides, as well as organising the general layout of the park, staff and attempting to keep visitors happy without going bankrupt.[CR]From a Sega perspective the game is fairly interesting - the game was technically released twice in Japan, first as regular Theme Park seen here, and again as Shin Theme Park, a localised variant. The game was originally designed with a mouse in mind, but none of the Sega ports are compatible with their respective mouse add ons, whether that be the Sega Mouse or Shuttle Mouse.[CR]Theme Park would later see a true sequel in the form of the fully 3D Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in North America) in 1999.",

You can erase certain walls to get through them and you can also erase boxes that most of the time teleport if you press down. Other boxes contain items. You also can sketch things and they will come to life, but you can only do this twice because Woody shrinks very quickly from doing this. There are also power-ups that make you grow again.",
