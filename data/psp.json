It was first released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in PAL regions on September 1, 2005, and is the first handheld installment in the PlayStation line of consoles. As a seventh generation console, the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS.[CR]The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced, and was the first real competitor of Nintendos handheld consoles after many challengers, such as SNKs Neo Geo Pocket and Nokias N-Gage, had failed. The PSPs advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device, which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles, computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software, other PSP systems, and the Internet. The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format \u2013 Universal Media Disc (UMD) \u2013 as its primary storage medium.[CR]Developer: Sony[CR]Media Medium: UMD Disc[CR]CPU: MIPS R4000-based[CR]Memory: 32MB[CR]Graphics: Sony CXD187[CR]Sound: Embedded Virtual Mobile Engine (VME) Sound Core[CR]Display: 480 x 272",

Despite the title, most of the games have little or nothing to do with any traditional arcade-style games.[CR]The five included games are:[CR]Pairs A simple memory game where players must match sixteen pairs of cards. There are three skill levels to choose from. At the easiest level, the cards show pictures of simple objects. At the medium level, the cards show numbers. At the highest difficulty level, the cards show complex symbols. Players are also timed and high scores are awarded for uncovering multiple pairs in a row.[CR]15Puzzle The classic 4x4 \"sliding tile\" puzzle. There are three levels of difficulty. Choosing the easiest setting assigns a number to each sliding tile and requires players to correctly organize the numbers. The medium and high settings require players to properly arrange a picture. Each session is timed, and the players' best times are saved on a high score table.[CR]Pool An eight-ball pool game for one or two players. Bonus points are awarded for sinking multiple balls in one shot and for \"chains\" (pocketing at least one ball in consecutive turns).[CR]Solitaire A standard Klondike Solitaire game with two modes of difficulty. The \"easy\" variant allows players to draw one card from the pile each turn while the \"hard\" variant requires players to draw three cards from the pile each turn. Additional points are awarded if the player is able to complete the game in a specified time limit.[CR]Tetroid Of all the games included in the compilation, this is the one that most resembles something one might find in an arcade. Tetroid plays like Arkanoid flipped on its side. However, along with having to break the bricks, the play field slowly and continuously shifts toward the paddle as the game progresses. The game ends when a row containing one or more bricks meets the paddle.[CR]All games have their own high score tables. If desired, a unique string can be generated for the player that will allow them to import their high scores onto a global leaderboard when entered on the developers' website.",

Chief Constable Melville Macnaghten investigated the case and wrote a final report naming five suspects.[CR]Real Crimes: Jack the Ripper is the second entry in a series of a hidden object games based on actual murder cases. As Macnaghten and the notorious forensic scientist Francis Galton, the player must search and click on all the items listed at left side of the screen, on locations related to the case and filled with assorted objects. Some of the items are clues about the murders, bringing up a window at the center of the screen with details about the object and its relation to the case. The hint button is a police badge below the list, that shows the position of one of the required items when activated. Police badges can be found and collected from the scenery for extra hints.[CR]A few mini-games appear between locations, where the player has to complete a jigsaw puzzle with pieces of a shredded letter, a tile-sliding picture puzzle, a spot-the-differences game with two similar images, a memory game with matching tarot cards and other similar challenges. There are two modes: Detective Mode with a time limit of 10 minutes per scene, and a Rookie Mode without any time constraints. Extra seconds can be added to the timer by collecting the fingerprints pressed over the scenery.",

Each level consists of multiple platforms that can be jumped up to or dropped down on. The player moves between these platforms while dodging environmental hazards and firing on the various aliens that constantly spawn in the level. Each level has several medals that can be earned for completing various tasks such as collecting a set number of coins or shooting a specific number of a certain type of alien. These medals are used to open up the later levels which are locked at the start.[CR]Players can also find temporary weapon upgrades for the standard laser gun such as the 3-Way beam and Laser Missile scattered around the levels. Also, the Spaceman can only take three hits before the game ends, however a health item will occasionally appear which restores a hit when collected. Being that the enemies never stop coming till the Spaceman dies, other than collecting medals, the other goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible for each level.",

Align three of your game pieces in a straight line to form a \"Mill\" with the reward of removing one of your opponent's pieces from the board.

When a player has only three game pieces left, their pieces can \"jump\" around the board to any open space.

The game starts quite easy and gradually ramps up to insane levels of coco-bullet action.[CR]What makes the game addictive is the combination of the predictable mazes and the random coconuts and beach balls. It makes the experience similar to a racing game, where the first few attempts at a new track are difficult, but once you've learnt the track, you can hone your movements to perfection whilst confidently dealing with the other cars.[CR]Coconut Dodge works in a similar way as you learn to memorise and master the mazes. Most of the mazes in the game have two different routes; one that is nice and easy, and one that is more difficult. The difficult route always has more valuable treasure in it. So, when you come across a maze you can get through it quite easily, which makes the game suitable for some quick casual play on the bus. However, to get the most treasure and a high score, you have to learn some pretty complex movements that require good rhythm and very high precision.",

Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.[CR]The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.[CR]The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a \"mixed\" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.",

The main game screen is mostly occupied by a central bare patch of land where the farm animals roam, surrounded by a series of farm implements and machines. All necessary actions are performed with clicks over interactive hotspots of the scenery.[CR]The objective is displayed at the start of the level, usually requiring a certain amount of resources, money or other goals. Initially, the player has to click on the well to collect water and on the ground to grow the grass that feeds most of the livestock. The animals can be purchased from a tab at the top, to eat the turf and generate products every few moments. Geese lay eggs, sheep shed cotton, cows produce milk, and all these resources have to be collected and stacked on boxes at the bottom storage shed. The boxes have to be shipped to the market by clicking on the truck, that takes a few moments to make the transportation of all the selected goods. A small animation at the bottom-right shows the vehicle going back and forth between the farm and the city.[CR]Dangerous bears appear randomly on the farm, and kill any animal that cross their paths. They have to be quickly contained on cages, and afterwards collected on boxes to be sold as a product. If the cage remains untouched on the field for too long, the bear eventually breaks free and runs out of the farm. The storage space at the bottom is limited, and sometimes bears and other products can't be stored on time and disappear after a while.[CR]The structures surrounding the game field are used to process the raw materials produced by the farm into more refined products, like powdered eggs, cheese, baked goods and other items. The stars received after completing a level have to be spent on upgrades to the machines on the shop screen, to make them more efficient and unlock new levels. There is no time limit to complete each stage, but finishing within a specific time frame, shown at the top, gives awards and bonus stars.",

                "plot": "Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita.  [CR]Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories.[CR]Your own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more.[CR]You must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you.[CR]However, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self.[CR]There are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going.[CR]The bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that's not all, as some enemies can't be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out.[CR]Enemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes.  The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils.[CR]As this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness.[CR]Floating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve.[CR]The final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better.[CR]Seems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in.[CR]That's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.[CR]This description was compiled from the following reviews:[CR]http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review[CR]http://www.pspminis.com/8859/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here/",

Freek can use his trident to skewer other minions, carry them around or use them as a pogo stick to jump higher. One type of creature rushes and can knock Freek over large gaps. Another type acts as a trampoline. Creatures can sometimes be dropped into the lava to create safe passages. A hug block rushes to hug you. By taking it out up to three can be skewered to use them as a bridge. Creatures are summoned through portals at specific locations. Freek can also draw their attention by whistling. Freek has his own portals that act as checkpoints when he passes them. Some levels require you to locate a number of peppers to unlock a pepper portal before a level can be finished.

In addition the wind decides too where the player's ball lands.[CR]As opposed to real life though, the player can influence the ball's flightpath during the flight by choosing in which direction it spins. This allows to compensate for wind and also for a bad angle at the strike. How hard the player hits the ball is decided by a gauge where the player needs to click at the right moment. The same goes for the angle. Although the game hands the player a club that it thinks fits the situation, he can also choose his own.",

The object is to eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, unless you eat a power pellet, which gives you the ability to eat the ghosts for a few seconds.[CR]What's new here is many different mazes and modes. This is designed from the ground up as a console game, so some arcade traditions are lost. The object is no longer to try to survive/get a high score without losing quarters, but to get a high score in a set time limit. You do still have a set number of lives, which makes your time end early if you lose all them.[CR]Unlike the original or its prodigy, Championship Edition isn't broken into distinct levels. Once you clear one side of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side. Eating the fruit regenerates the empty half with new walls, dots, power pellets, etc and increases the game speed.[CR]The iPhone version of the game adds two additional modes. In \"Mission Mode\", you must clear a specific goal set by the game at the beginning of play (such as eating two apples, or eating eight ghosts consecutively). In \"Challenge Mode\", you must aim to achieve the top score for each course, but this time the ghosts have been sped up so that they are initially much faster.[CR]The look is a bright neon which evokes the classic Pac-Man but takes advantage of nearly 30 years of increased computer power.",

You do this by constructing towers along the path to attack oncoming Vectoids. Success is not based solely on the types of tower you select, but where you place them and what upgrade and bonus options you take.[CR]At your disposal are eleven flavors of towers, each of which can be upgraded to level 10 (increasing the tower's damage and range). The Green Lasers, for example, lock onto one Vectoid and deal ongoing damage. The Red Spammer fires heat-seeking rockets at random targets in range. Blue Ray towers drain power and cause Vectoids to slow down. The in-game guide lists each tower in detail. Every few waves you'll also be rewarded with a Yellow Energy Cell, which you can use to purchase one of three Boosts. Damage and Range Booster towers can be placed on a grid to increase the stats of other towers around it.[CR]Vector TD for PSP features eight maps (two Beginner, three Normal, three Extreme) as well as all eleven tower and seven enemy types of the original Flash version. Exclusive to the minis version is a brand-new control interface -- you'll be able to select each gri' using the D-pad or analog stick and place/upgrade towers.",
