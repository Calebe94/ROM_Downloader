Though it initially offered only nine games at launch, its library only continued to grow as time went on and other potential competitors backed off.[CR][CR]The Atari 2600 is also the one console that could arguably be claimed as the herald of modern gaming's success and a stark reminder of economic collapse's ability to topple even the mightiest; the crash of 1983 was at least partially due to the constant churn of low quality games being produced for the console.[CR][CR]But that Atari 2600 lays claim to its fair share of games that still stand as pillars within their respective genres. So far removed from its heyday, it might be easy to forget exactly which these were and are.[CR][CR]Thank goodness for this definitive list of the Best Atari 2600 games of all time!",

The second joystick is used to control many of the extra features, like hyperspace, which is wise move considering the original Defender instead had the player going off the screen in order to use such things.",

To begin with, it was first conceived as an enhancement kit called \"Crazy Otto\" for the original Pac-Man arcade cabinets by programmers at the General Computer Corporation. When legal troubles forced them to halt, they decided to sell the game as a whole. Thus, with a few changes, Ms. Pac-Man was born.[CR][CR]Whereas the original Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man was a (very) poor port, the port of Ms. Pac-Man was nothing if not stellar and crisp. Of everything included in the arcade cabinet, the only thing missing from the Atari 2600 version were the intermissions. That means that four different mazes, different-colored ghosts, fruit, and even an animated title screen made the jump to consoles, and that's none too shabby, especially considering how much was cut from the original Pac-Man port.",

It's no wonder that the creator had nightmares of nuclear war while coding the game.[CR][CR]Though it began life as an arcade game, the Atari 2600 port remained miraculously faithful to the source. It limited the player to one missile base, three missiles on the screen at once, and had some other oddities, but remained largely the same even down to the screeching alarms and tones. As an added bonus, the backgrounds changed colors as the waves continue.[CR][CR]The hectic pace and consistent movement made Missile Command an enjoyable game when it first released, and it remains so because of it. Quick! Someone give this game the Geometry Wars treatment, stat!",

Largely credited with establishing the platformer genre, Pitfall! is as difficult as it is critically acclaimed. Starring the eponymous Pitfall Harry, players must rush across over 200 screens of treacherous jungle in order to collect all the jewels and treasures that lay in wait.[CR][CR]The real trouble comes when you factor in the time limit - a mere 20 minutes. The game even taunted players by providing underground tunnels that advanced the screen three times for every full tunnel explored. Unfortunately, said tunnels are even more dangerous that the ground above them with scorpions guarding their passages. If you were looking to actually complete the game, however, they were a necessary evil.[CR][CR]Those lucky enough to reach 20,000 points could even score a sweet patch from Activision for their trouble. How many other games can boast such claims?",
