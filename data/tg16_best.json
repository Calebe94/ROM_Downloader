It had a processor which was actually somewhat weaker than most 16-bit systems, in that it was really only 8-bits. On the other hand, it was one of the first systems with an official CD add-on which allowed it to store games up to a whopping 650 MB large! On one hand, this meant a lot of horrible FMV games. On the other hand, this means absolutely rockin platformers and shmups. These are the Best TurboGrafx 16 Games of all time.",

As an arcade port this is actually very impressive, if it wasn't for the lack of 2-player you could very easily call this an improvement, the graphics have actually been added to, and there' even some new levels.",

The game's art design here is stellar, and there's also an always welcome 2-player option so you can bring a friend along for the ride. Overall this is a very good arcade port, leagues better than the drab Sega Mega Drive release as far as I'm concerned",

Outside of those elements the levels never fail to be interesting, and engrossing. I'll add though that its worth playing the game on hard mode to get the most out of it, as for a game as pricey as it is Magical Chase can be beaten without too much trouble on the lower difficulties.",

Here they're added much more interesting, now scrolling stages which really bring Bomberman's world to life for the first time, they've also made it so you no longer have to blow up every single enemy to proceed, just the new shield generators protecting an artifact in each stage. The ever important multiplayer is as fun as ever here, with this one introducing Rooeys to the series (ride-able creatures which give you an extra hit point, and an ability). This is much better than the later Mega Drive release, with more detailed, better coloured graphics, superior animation, less slowdown, and 5-player support instead of Mega Bomberman's 4-players.",
