All are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, roughly twice that of similar designs, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw; Star Raiders is widely considered the platform's killer app. Machines with similar performance would not appear until the BBC Micro in late 1981 and the Commodore 64 in 1982.[CR]Developer:  Atari[CR]Manufacturer  Atari[CR]CPU:  MOS Technology 6502B[CR]Memory:  8KB[CR]Graphics:  384x256[CR]Sound:  4x oscillators with noise mixing, or 2x AM digital[CR]Media:  Floppy or Cartrige[CR]Max Controllers:  2 or 4",

The game was released in 1980 and programmed by Carol Shaw, and was the first released video game designed by a woman. The game was published twice by Atari (one text label and one picture label) and once by Sears (as a text label).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is played on four stacked 4x4 grids. Players alternate turns placing an 'X' or 'O' and must align 4 of their own symbols in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to win, similar to Milton Bradley's board game Qubic. The game features simple graphics with white grids on a bright blue background.The game can be played either against a human opponent or AI which features 8 different skill levels; however, the AI can take a very long time to make a move on high difficulty levels, in late-game states.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Asteroids was first released as a monochrome, vector-based arcade game by Atari Inc. in November 1979. It was designed and programmed by Dominic Walsh and Ed Logg. The aim of the game is to destroy all of the asteroids that drift randomly across the screen, while also avoiding collision with them. Occasional flying saucers, which come in large and small varieties, attempt to impede progress.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Original arcade version.The objective of Asteroids is to collect as many points as possible by destroying all of the asteroids on screen, and to avoid death (either by collision or being shot by a flying saucer). The ship appears as a small triangle, whose default position is the center of the screen. It can rotate 360 degrees and move forward with the use of thrusters. The ship possesses momentum and will drift for a time after its thrusters are deactivated. At any time, the player may activate a \u201chyperspace\u201d ability, which warps the ship to a random area of the screen (and possibly into the path of an oncoming asteroid).The asteroids themselves come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. When large asteroids are shot, they break up into two medium asteroids. The same goes for medium asteroids into small, at which point they can be destroyed with a single shot. In addition to asteroids, there are also two types of flying saucers which appear randomly, accompanied by a siren noise. The large type shoots in random directions, while the small type aims at the player. Destroying a saucer will net the player a 1000 point bonus.Atari 2600 version.The action presented is \"wrapped\" around the screen along both the horizontal and vertical axis (i.e. if an asteroid drifts off the right side of the screen, it will reappear on the left). The game music consists of a steady \u201cheartbeat\u201d sound which increases in tempo as asteroids are destroyed. After all on-screen asteroids have been eliminated, a new round begins and the number of asteroids increases (up to a maximum of 12). The game ends if the player loses all of his/her lives. Due to a programming bug, the game score will roll back to zero after reaching 99,990.[CR]Development[CR]Standing arcade cabinet.Asteroids was designed around Atari\u2019s proprietary Digital Vector Generator (DVG), a vector graphics processor that came out of the company\u2019s off-campus research lab in Grass Valley, California. The DVG was first used by Atari engineer Howard Delman to create the company\u2019s first vector-based game, Lunar Lander. When it was decided that Asteroids would also utilize a vector display, Delman modified an existing Lunar Lander board and handed it off to Dominic Walsh and Ed Logg.The Asteroids board is based around a standard MOS 6502 CPU, which executes the game program, and the aforementioned DVG. Extra memory was added, as well as seven distinct audio circuits. The main Asteroids program uses only 6 KB of ROM code, and another 2 KB of vector ROM contains the descriptions of the main graphical elements (asteroids, saucers, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits).[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Asteroids proved to be extremely popular upon its release and, after initially selling over 70,000 units, Atari was forced to ship Asteroids hardware in Lunar Lander cabinets in order to meet the steadily rising demand. In some areas, arcade operators installed larger cash boxes onto their Asteroids cabinets to keep up with the high player traffic. The success of Asteroids prompted Atari to continue iterating on its vector technology; a color display was developed soon after, used in such games as Tempest and Major Havoc.Blasteroids, one of several arcade sequels.Asteroids was subsequently ported to most of Atari\u2019s home consoles, including the 2600, 7800 and Lynx. A 5200 version was planned and advertised, but was never actually released. The 7800 version is notable for featuring co-operative play, and was included as a built-in game for the console\u2019s European release. A sequel was released in 1981, dubbed Asteroids Deluxe, that included blue-tinted graphics, a shield ability (in place of a hyperspace jump), rotating asteroids, and new \u201ckiller satellite\u201d enemies. Two more arcade sequels followed, with Space Duel arriving in 1982 and Blasteroids in 1987.Many games have either borrowed some of Asteroids basic mechanics, or cloned its gameplay outright. Included in the former category are Williams\u2019 Sinistar, which has players shoot asteroids in order to collect resources, and Mine Storm, the built-in game for the failed Vectrex system. In the latter group are Acornsoft's Meteors and Ambrosia Software's Maelstrom, as well as Asterax, Astrogeddon, Stardust, Spheres of Chaos and Astro Fire.In the last few decades, Asteroids has been included in a number of arcade compilations, including the Windows 3.1 Microsoft Arcade packages, Atari Anniversary Edition (2001, Dreamcast and PC), and Atari Anthology (2004, Xbox and Playstation 2). Asteroids (arcade and 2600) and Asteroids Deluxe were also released for Microsoft\u2019s Game Room platform in 2010.[CR]Movie[CR]In July of 2009 it was announced that Universal Studios had won the rights to a movie adaption of the arcade classic Asteroids. Lorenzo di Bonaventura is attached to produce and a script is being penned by Mathew Lopez.[CR]World Record[CR]The world record for the arcade version of Asteroids is 41,338,740 points, set by John McAllister on April 6th, 2010. To achieve the score he played the game for over 58 hours. McAllister's score beat a 27-year-old record of 41,336,440 points previously held by Scott Safran, a 15-year-old boy from Cherry Hill, New Jersey who initially set the record on November 15, 1982.[CR]",

When all of the mega mines have been destroyed, you will move on to the next, faster chase!",

As enemy ships pass through the screen unharmed, they progressively make lower passes until they are at the lowest level, where they deploy a destructive energy beam. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A ship reaches the lowest levelIn order to defend the city, the player has up to three cannons. The main cannon, positioned in the middle, shoots straight up and is fired by pressing the button by itself. Two support cannons are also available on either side of the screen. These cannons shoot at an angle and are fired by holding left or right on the joystick (depending on which gun you want to fire) and pressing the button. After successfully defending each wave, the subsequent volley of ships comes a bit faster. Additionally, certain ships fly faster than others. Similar to Missile Command, lost structures and cannons can be regained at higher scores. [CR]Notes[CR]A very rare version of Atlantis called \"Atlantis II\" also exists. It was sent to the high-scorers of Imagic's \"Defend Atlantis\" contest in order to determine the final four finalists. This version is a faster and much more challenging version of the game.Note that the ship that escapes the city once the player loses looks a lot like a ship from another Imagic game, called Cosmic Ark.In the instructions to Cosmic Ark, the pilots of the mothership which is central to the game are even referred to as Atlanteans, suggesting that the game Atlantis takes place either before or after Cosmic Ark, or at least in the same creative universe.The Intellivision version of this game had additional features, including spotlights used during the night raids, and a targeting reticule which more closely suggested the game play from Missile Command than the straight-shooting 2600 version of the defensive cannons did.[CR]",

By moving the attack ship off the left edge of the screen you will proceed to the next sector. Moving off the right edge allows you to wrap around to the left side. You must destroy all tartillian defenders that attack you before you can advance. For single player the 1st joystick controls the movement of the attack ship when the fire button is not depressed and controls the targeting cusor and laser blasts when the fire button is depressed. For two players the first joystick is the plot's controller which manuevers the attack ship and controls the shields (the lyso-blast weapon cannot be fired when shields are activated). The 2nd joystick is the gunner control which manuevers the targeting cursor of the attack ship and fires the lyso-blast weapon.[CR]~From the back of the box[CR]",

                "plot": "A vast beam matrix has enshrouded the Earth. This glowing blue grid forms the Restrictor Shield, 99 sectors deep and teeming with hostile alien life. Your mission is to move through all sectors, destroying the enemy craft as you progress. Deeper sectors reveal new enemy types, each with their own method of impeding your success.The player's ship can only move left and right, travelling along one of five beams as the blue beam matrix scrolls towards them. The ship is armed a laser lariat and torpedoes, with the laser being the principle weapon. When the fire button is pressed, the laser will shoot along the beam the player is currently on. The main aim is to destroy all white saucers in a sector, causing the Sector Sentinel to appear. This can only be destroyed with a torpedo \u2013 three are given to the player at the start of each sector \u2013 and a successful hit awards bonus points before play progresses to the next sector.  [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]  White Enemy Saucers      These are the main enemies you'll encounter. There are 15 in each sector, and you'll need to blast every one of them before you can progress. Saucers change up their attack pattern every few sectors e.g. dodging from left to right while spewing a string of bombs, or simply flying towards your ship in an attempt to ram you. Once you've destroyed all of the saucers in a sector a Sentinel craft will appear, giving you a chance to destroy it. Saucers appear from Sector 1.  Brown Space Debris      This rock-hard refuse will fly in a straight line down a beam at you. Normal laser fire will not damage it, so it can be avoided or destroyed with one of the three torpedoes you are given at the start of each life. Space debris starts appearing from Sector 2 onwards.    Yellow Chirper Ships      These mouthy aliens will announce their arrival with a twin-trill alert. They will then fly horizontally from one side of the screen to the other. Chirpers do not fire at your ship, and cannot collide with it. As such, they serve merely to provide bonus points for any player with a quick trigger finger. Chirpers start appearing from Sector 4.  Green Blocker Ships         Nigh-indestructible enemies that will streak in from the side of the screen, locking onto the beam that your ship is travelling down before trying to ram you. They must then either be avoided or destroyed with a torpedo, as they are impervious to regular laser fire. Although blockers can appear while clearing a sector of white saucers, they predominantly show up to protect a Sector Sentinel. On later levels, more and more green blockers will assault your craft, attempting to thwart any effort to blow up the Sentinel by blocking your torpedoes and causing you to switch beams to get a clear shot. Blockers start appearing as regular enemies from Sector 6.  Green Bounce Craft      This rotund enemy comes from the side of the screen and bounces horizontally across from one beam to the next, hoping to land on your ship to destroy it. If it is unsuccessful, it will bounce off the opposite side of the screen to return at another random interval. Regular lasers cannot harm it, so shoot it with a torpedo or try not to be on the beam it bounces on. Green bouncers appear from Sector 7.Blue Chargers      Chargers will zip down the screen at you along a random beam. They have two methods of attack, depending on what beam your ship is travelling on. If you're on the same beam as a charger when it reaches the bottom of the screen, it will collide with your ship and destroy it. If you're not on the same beam, the charger will wait for a few seconds before leaving the screen. During this small pause there is a chance that you will move sideways and onto the beam where the stationary charger is lurking, resulting in your death. While they aren't actually destroyed by your laser, firing a quick shot up the beam will cause a charger to bounce backwards into the distance from where it came. Chargers begin to appear from Sector 10.Orange Trackers      These devilish ships will track onto the beam your ship is flying along and attempt to ram you. Unlike green blockers, however, trackers will change beams to follow you should you try to avoid them. Initially, they will only change beam once to try and cause a collision. However, the further into the beam matrix you travel, the more intent the trackers will become; soon they will start to change course two or more times in their efforts. Additionally, they are invulnerable to common laser fire, meaning you'll need to be fast to avoid them or see them off with one of your precious torpedoes. Trackers start appearing at Sector 12.Red Zig Bombs      The final enemy to appear is one of the trickiest. Like the chirper, a Zig bomb will make a sound before making its way onscreen. When it does, it will find the beam your ship is on and start to come towards you. Zig bombs cannot be killed outright with regular laser fire, but they can be handled in various ways. If you manage to shoot a Zig bomb with your laser, it will change from red to green. It will then continue its flight down the beam it has chosen, before disappearing off the bottom of the screen. If, for whatever reason, you don't shoot the Zig bomb, it will travel down the beam before performing a last-minute flip across one beam towards your ship. This means if you fail to shoot the Zig, you should ensure that you are at least two beams away from it before it leaves the screen. Of course, the third method of taking a Zig out is to blast it with a torpedo. Zig bombs will appear from Sector 14 onwards.Sector Sentinel      Once all of the white saucers in a sector have been eliminated, an alarm will sound. The Sector Sentinel will then slide into view from either side of the screen. It will continue across the beam matrix horizon until it is either destroyed or leaves on the side opposite its starting position. During its migration, you can attempt to bring it down with any torpedoes you have in your stock. The higher the sector number, the more green blockers will flood onto the screen to prevent the Sentinel from being destroyed. A successful hit will cause the Sentinel to explode and bonus points are given depending on the number of lives you have accrued. Whether or not you destroy a Sentinel, the sector has been cleared and you move onto the next one. [CR]",

                "plot": "Few people even remember, much less have actually seen a Blaster arcade machine.  This unique 3-D shooting game was actually the unofficial sequel to Robotron: 2084 (set in the year 2085).  Unfortunately the powerful 3-D graphics used in the game made it very expensive to produce, so only a few hundred were made (estimates say around 500).  Another problem was that while Blaster was gorgeous to look at and fun to watch, it was a very difficult game to play.  Few players were skilled enough to reach the end, and as most arcade operators know, overly difficult games don't make much money (such was Gravitars fate).  The odd 3-D style graphics also tended to confuse people and scare away potential players (this was 1983 after all).  This is a shame because games like Blaster and I, Robot were really ahead of their time.[CR]It is worth noting that the screenshots on this page simply don't do the game justice due to the inability of a still picture to capture unique 3-D movement of the objects. [CR]At this point you're probably thinking that Blaster is just another great looking arcade port for the 5200 right?  Wrong!  It was actually the arcade version that was the port!  As hard as it is to believe, the Atari 400/800 version was the first version of Blaster to be developed.  Vid Kidz was so convinced that the Atari 5200 was going to become one of the greatest systems of all time that they developed Blaster for the Atari 400/800 while they waited for the 5200 hardware to be finalized and released (400/800 code was easily ported to the 5200).  However once they showed their prototype to Williams, Williams decided that the wanted to do an arcade version of Blaster because \"The arcade version always came first\".[CR]After the arcade game came out and met with modest success, Vid Kidz went to Atari with their prototypes to work out a deal.  Unfortunately by this time it was 1984 and the video game market was crashing fast.  Although Vid Kidz finally worked out a deal, Atari decided not to release the game due the weak market.  The really sad part of all of this is that the 5200 version was ready back in 1983 and could have been a huge hit for Atari had Williams not demanded that the arcade game come first.  [CR]Blaster is a first person 3-D shooter seen from the cockpit of the Blastership.  Although it may look odd and confusing, the the controls couldn't be simpler.  Pushing left or right will move the ship left or right, and pushing down and up will cause the ship to climb or dive.  Since the game is seen though the cockpit of the ship, you will see the whole screen move in response to the controls rather than seeing a ship move around a stationary screen.  This can make avoiding obstacles a little difficult since you can't exactly tell where your ship is, but the game gives alot of leeway in this department.[CR]The game is separated into four different stages: The Robot Grid, Time Tunnel, Outer Space, and Planetoids.  Each stage has its own unique characteristics, but the goal of each stage is the same: shoot anything and everything that moves, rescue all humanoids, and avoiding losing all your energy.  After clearing all four stages, you will be returned to the Robot Grid and the difficulty will increase.[CR]Robot Grid[CR]This is the first stage you'll encounter and is arguably the best looking of the four.  The Robot Grid plays a bit like Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, in the fact that you must move through archways while shooting all enemies that get in your way.  While it isn't absolutely necessary to pass through each archway, doing so will net you massive amounts of bonus points.  The first archway is worth 1,000 points, and each successive archway is worth an additional 1,000 points.  However if you miss an archway the bonus will be reset back to 1,000.  Robots can be similarly chained for large bonus point payoffs (starting at 100 and increasing 100 points with each robot).[CR]As you weave your way through archways while navigating the plain you'll also run across walls.  Walls are transparent grids that are reminiscent of the obstacles in the trench scene of Star Wars: The Arcade Game.  Avoiding walls is rather difficult as they take up a large area of the playfield, but it is absolutely necessary as they take off a large portion of your energy if hit. Starting on level 2 Kamikaze planes will attempt to ram your ship at regular intervals.  The closer the ship is when you destroy it, the more points it is worth, but be careful that you don't wait too long...[CR]Time Tunnel[CR]The stage is reminiscent of the Time Warp stage from Gorf.  Here you must maneuver around the time tunnel in an attempt to save as many humanoids as possible.  These humanoids are from a 20th century starship disaster and have been stuck in the time warp for a millennia.  The first humanoid you rescue is worth 1,000 points, and each successive humaniod is worth another 200 points (up to a maximum of 2,000 points).  Missing a humanoid will reset the bonus value back to 1,000 points. Thankfully there are no enemies on this stage so you are free to concentrate on collecting humanoids.[CR]Outer Space[CR]This stage is similar to the Robot Grid, but there are no annoying archways to fly through.  Unfortunately there are a ton more enemies on this stage, making your trip much more difficult.  There are four different types of enemies, each enemy type poses a unique threat.[CR]Xitan Mineships: Xitan Mineships are tricky little buggers.  They like to buzz your ship at high speeds and then throw a barrage of deadly space mines in their wake.  Avoid these mines at all costs![CR]Z-15 Fitershipz: Z-15's are your standard attack ship and will confront you directly with lasers blazing.  On an interesting side note, the Fitershipz look suspiciously like Tie Fighters...[CR]Destructor Satellites: Destructor Satellites are large four paneled objects that appear at the most inopportune times.  These fast moving sentinels take up such a large portion of the screen they are quite difficult to avoid.  Take special care to avoid their deadly laser barrage when taking evasive action.[CR]Death Riders: Death Riders are the absolute deadliest enemy in the game.  These deadly creatures (which resemble a skeleton riding a rocket) pack some serious firepower and they aren't afraid to use it.  If they fail to penetrate your shields they will attempt to ram you at high speeds. [CR]Planetoids[CR]This is the final stage of each level.  This stage is similar to the Time Tunnel, but this time there are deadly planetoids and saucers to avoid.  There are two different types of saucers that hide in the planetoids: Purple Saucers simply move about the screen taking pot shots at you, but Red Saucers will attempt to ram into your ship.  Red Saucers can be shot at close range for a large bonus and chained for an even larger bonus (up to 3,000 points).[CR]As you navigate the planetiod field you will eventually hear a beeping noise, this is your cue that the Energizer is near by.  The Energizer looks like a large glowing E and is hiding somewhere along the rocks.  Touching the Energizer will instantly repair your ship and warp you to the next level.  You may eventually notice that all the stranded humanoids in this stage make a path that leads right to the Enegizer, so it's in your best interest to try and rescue them along the way.  Missing the Energizer won't cause you any harm, but it will make the next level more difficult.[CR]Blaster is an amazing piece of programming shows that the 5200 was capable of great things when properly programmed.  Blaster may not have had much success as an arcade game, but would have been a sure fire hit for Atari if it had been released when it was originally finished in early 83.  Unfortunately management bureaucracy once again reared its ugly head and ruined another great game.  Thankfully we can all now enjoy one of the greatest lost games of all time.[CR]https://www.atariprotos.com/5200/software/blaster/blaster.htm[CR]",

Players control Rockford, a stick man who navigates a series of caverns filled with Earth, boulders, diamonds and a series of creatures who kill on touch. The concept is simple: collect enough diamonds to escape each level within a time limit. But while Rockford isn't affected by gravity, the boulders and diamonds are -- remove a piece of earth underneath a boulder and it will fall, often setting off a chain reaction of falling debris. So the game plays as a puzzle game; with each move that the player makes, they have to anticipate the consequences.Boulder Dash is one of a very short list of titles that began on home machines that were later transferred to the arcades. In 2006, Atari2600.com developed an Atari 5200 version of the game in conjunction with First Star Software. One iteration of the game was released in 2007 by ZX Games, and is a largely faithful remake of the original over 20 years after its original release. In 2009, a flash-based Browser version was released, sporting updated graphics.Virtual ConsoleThe Commodore 64 version of Boulder Dash was released on to the Wii Virtual Console on June 1st 2009 for 500 Wii Points.[CR]",

You and up to three friends can select from any of eight player sprites, male or female. There are six skill levels with eight buildings per level. After you finish a building, you will be given part of a special message. There are six messages, one per skill level. [CR]You get from floor to floor by way of elevators. Be sure the elevator is at your floor when you board or you will fall down the elevator shaft. There are also three ladders out of the basement. Watch out for Flying Half-Pints. They will appear on one side of the building at any floor except the basement and will move horizontally across. You must jump or duck to avoid them. [CR]Starting at building number two, you must also avoid Dumb Buckets. These will walk around and ride the elevators but they always move in a set pattern. Starting on building three and continuing every other building, you have to contend with Brenda, the superintendent's brat. She will put hand prints on your freshly painted walls, which will cost you forty points and require repainting to finish that building. You can grab the candy cane in these buildings and give it to her. This will stop her for fifteen seconds so you can repaint.[CR]Starting with building four, you must beware of the Bucket Chucker. Unlike the Dumb Bucket, he does not follow a set pattern, he follows you. You cannot destroy the Bucket Chucker but there are two ways he can be trapped. One way is to use the paint mixer, a square within a square. You touch it to turn it on for four seconds and if the Bucket Chucker touches it while it is on, he will shake for four seconds. You can turn the paint mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is in it, unlimited times. Another way to trap the Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the Bucket Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The Bucket Chucker will then be stuck in the basement until you lose a brush.[CR]Starting on building five, you must jump over steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a brush. In buildings six, seven and eight, your brush will run dry after eight, seven or six rooms, respectively. To refill, simply touch the large paint brushes in some rooms.",

Using your ship's twin cannons you can destroy all of them for points, but every fuel silo destroyed also gives you 5 units of fuel. Fuel decreases over time from 100, so destroying fuel silos is necessary to make it out alive. You control your rate of descent by moving closer to the edge of the screen, but this is much more dangerous and could result in destruction. If you have extra lives remaining you respawn, but are still limited by the fuel you have. After descending far enough you are rushed by rocket ships and martian fighters, which you must destroy or dodge to avoid. After this you descend into a narrow, glowing cavern and come into contact with the reactor at the bottom. You set the reactor to detonate, and must now ascend the cavern you just entered to escape before the reactor explodes. Should you die during this sequence, you are allowed to continue, but the countdown timer is not reset.As difficulty increases, emplacements fire back, opening and closing doors, and there are floating mines which block the cavern and must be eliminated. There are five caverns in all, each significantly more difficult than the last.This game closely resembles a side-scrolling predecessor Scramble, by Konami.Other VersionsThe game was later hacked to run on an Atari 5200, but was never officially released there. The game was developed to a prototype stage for the Atari 2600, but wasn't released on the console. Said prototype would show up as one of the games present on the Atari Flashback 2, a plug-and-play 2600-style device containing 42 built-in games.Greg Christensen eventually developed a sequel, known as Caverns of Mars II, but it wasn't released in its original time frame. Later, Antic published the sequel under the name Mars Mission II.[CR]",

In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12.

It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment.

To select a stage, the player navigates the ship through a tunnel in any order. Each tunnel has different character models and color schemes for the following sections.[CR]Tunnel[CR]Tunnels are in first-person perspective, where the player controls a space ship as it navigates through. Mines serve as obstacles, and must be destroyed by firing at them. Missing a mine or getting hit by one results in a loss of energy. Energy levels stay from section to section, so it is important to destroy all mines.[CR]Landing[CR]Landing the ship on a platform is the object of this stage. There are numerous missile launchers which will destroy the ship if the player is hit. The ship can drop bombs on the missile launchers for points and to make the landing area safer. The topography of the asteroid is hazardous, requiring careful navigation to avoid the walls. Hitting a wall results in energy loss.[CR]Surface[CR]Once safely on the surface, the object shifts to gathering four energy bars and returning them to the ship on a 3/4 view action / platform section. There are numerous enemies and traps to avoid. To help, the player can \"run\" briefly or use a jetcopter or rocket springs (depending on the stage) to navigate the stage safely. Once the bars are collected, the stages begin in reverse order to get back to the city safely. If the player runs out of energy, a life is lost, and the stage must be restarted. When the player runs out of lives, gameplay ends.[CR]",

He may jump the spaces between platforms or fall through them.[CR]Acid Chamber (second screen)[CR]Drops of deadly acid fall from the ceiling and rise from the floor. Danger Ranger's task is to pick up the treasure chests whilst avoiding the acid. Be sure you are far enough to the right to get them (listen for the sound). The chamber is also guarded by four demons which must be shot before he can get past them to the next level. As the game proceeds, more shots are required to kill them.[CR]CONTROL[CR]The joystick controls Danger Ranger's movement.[CR]Up = Danger Ranger will jump.[CR]Down = Danger Ranger will duck.[CR]Left or right = walk or jump left or right.[CR]NEW GAME[CR]Pressing BREAK at any time will abandon the current game and return you to the title screen.[CR]PAUSE[CR]Pressing 'P' when the playing screen is displayed will pause the game, press 'R' to resume.[CR]SCORING[CR]The figure in the top right shows your current score, the one in the top left is the current hi-score. The centre figure is the current level of play and to its right is the number of men you have left. During a two-player game, the current player is indicated below the score.[CR]HI-SCORE TABLE[CR]Danger Ranger maintains a ten entry hi-score table. If yours is one of the top ten scores, you will be invited to enter your initials (max. 3) at the termination of the game.[CR]",

For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.[CR]For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.[CR]Scoring over 8,600 points got you a \"Bronze\" patch, over 9,000 a \"Silver\" patch, and over 10,000 a \"Gold\" patch by sending proof to Activision.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-5200/activision-decathlon[CR]",

An HUD located on the top of the screen indicates where the UFOs are located; the goal is to achieve as many points as possible.Defender has a wrap-around landscape, and that landscape contains as many as ten humanoids. Alien ships called Landers attempt to abduct these humanoids. If a Lander grabs a humanoid and carries it up to the top of the screen, the Lander and humanoid merge into a much more aggressive Mutant ship. If all of the humanoids are killed, the land at the bottom of the screen explodes and the player must fight in empty space. At this point, all the Landers become Mutants. Every fifth wave restores the humanoid count to ten, regenerating the planetary surface, if necessary.Defender had a fairly complicated control scheme for the time, with a lever for moving up and down and buttons for thrust, fire, reverse, smart bomb, and hyperspace. Most ports and even some emulated versions of Defender replace the thrust and reverse buttons in favor of a four-way joystick to control movement and direction.The game was programmed by  Eugene Jarvis and  Larry DeMar, who would later go on to form an external development company known as Vid Kidz.[CR]",

Atari's own,: version was a big disappointment because of the graphics. While they were very good overall, they didn't really resemble true Space Invaders visuals.[CR]Roklan has put it all together.[CR]Deluxe Invaders can be played by one or two people. The invaders drop down noisily from space to begin the attack. The barriers are present and, just like in the coin-op, can be breached by the player. The UFO also appears across the top of the screen as in real Invaders. The player must shoot all the aliens and clear the screen. Then the invasion begins again with the enemy one row closer to the defending cannon. As you all know by now, no one ever wins this game.[CR]Roklan has included some unique game variations to its edition. One interesting idea is that the invaders split into two little aliens when they're blasted by the player. This makes for a totally different style of game. Normal invader strategy goes out the window when this option is chosen. At times there are unusual combinations of large and small aliens in the same row at the same time.[CR]It is clear that the people at Roklan Software really know the Atari well. The sound and graphics routines in this game are excellent.[CR]However there is one slight bug in the program. When in two player mode, the high score is only registered for player number two. This is not a serious problem but it is annoying.[CR]All in all, Deluxe Invaders is an excellent version of the classic arcade game. I would definitely recommend[CR]it.[CR]",

Unlike other early shooting games such as Space Invaders, Demon Attack does not give the player obstacles with which to hide from enemy attack. Also, compared to Space Invader-type games, there are fewer aliens on screen at any given time but the alien sprites are bigger and more elaborate. The cannon also moves much faster, and has a smaller hitbox making it easier to evade enemy fire. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]First level of the Atari 2600 version.The player controls a single cannon at the bottom of the screen which can move left and right. Up to three Demons will warp into existence and float around, with the lowest Demon dropping missiles. Destroying a Demon will cause a new one to warp in until the end of the combat wave, at which point destroying the remaining Demons will clear the stage.As the stages progress, the aliens become faster and change appearance, and some will split in half when struck instead of being destroyed. If one half of the lowest Demon is destroyed, the other half will fly down towards the cannon in a kamikaze run. Thanks to its small size, it can be difficult to hit before it reaches the ground, though it can be evaded if there is enough room to the side. Once both halves are destroyed, the middle Demon will float down to take the place of the lowest, and if one half is destroyed the remaining half will immediately fly down towards the cannon. Later demons also drop missiles that follow them, letting them sweep their fire across an area when they move.The first run of cartridges stopped gameplay after the 84th wave, supposedly by design. Every run of the cartridges thereafter allows the player to 'wrap' the score and gameplay continues until all lives are lost, though the difficulty does not increase.[CR]Variations[CR]There two multiplayer modes - first, alternating play stage-by-stage to compete for score, and second, co-operative play with the cannon changing color to represent the controls switching between first and second player at pre-set intervals.The other option allows the cannon's shots to be guided by the motion of the cannon itself, much like the attacks of the later Demons.[CR]Legal Complications[CR]Atari itself filed a lawsuit against Imagic, claiming it was too similar to  Phoenix. Imagic and Atari settled out-of-court, and Demon Attack went on to sell well.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The First LevelThe arcade classic Donkey Kong rose out of Nintendo's desire to crack into the United States arcade market. The company's president back in 1981, Hiroshi Yamauchi, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called Radar Scope (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named Shigeru Miyamoto.The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.Donkey Kong was followed-up by Donkey Kong Jr. , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, Donkey Kong Jr., who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed Mario. [CR]Development[CR]The Second LevelUpon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular Popeye character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular Popeye arcade game. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named Jumpman, who had to save his girlfriend, Pauline, from the evil gorilla named Donkey Kong. After designing the concept Miyamoto approached his more colleague Gunpei Yokoi who would assist the young designer by supervising the technical development of the project.Unfortunately due to the technical limitations in place not all of Miyamoto's ideas for the game were able to be included as concepts such as incorporating seesaws into the game or having the characters expressions more defined and animated were unable to be incremented into the game. These technical restrictions would ultimately have an effect on the character design of Jumpman as he was forced to make the character small whilst still making him look human. As such Miyamoto thought it best to give the character distinct features,\"such as giving him a big nose. We gave him a moustache so that we didn't need to draw a mouth, as it's often difficult to show facial expressions with small characters. We also gave him big hands.\"The name Donkey Kong was ultimately the decision of Miyamoto too. Wanting to give the impression of a stubborn, stupid gorilla he thought of animals which he thought were dim-witted and stubborn he came up with the idea of 'Donkey' which he believed to mean stupid. He also wished to incorporate the word 'Kong' into the title which in Japanese gives the idea of apes. Putting the two together the end result was \"Donkey Kong\". [CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The Final LevelDonkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story. Donkey Kong changed the way people played games; no longer was it just about high scores, gamers began to play the game to find out what would happen next. Donkey Kong became one of the most iconic video games of all-time and a huge part of American pop culture, gaining mentions on countless television shows, songs, and movies. Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, Mario.As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the official site.In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old easter egg, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.[CR]Donkey Kong: Original Edition[CR]In 2010, a special version of the NES release of Donkey Kong was available to those in Europe who purchased the special Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary Wii. This version, subtitled \"Original Edition\", restored the missing \"pie factory\" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.This edition of the game would not release in Japan or the United States until 2012, and only then, on the 3DS. In Japan, it was a pre-order bonus for New Super Mario Bros. 2. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the digital download versions of Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Style Savvy: Trendsetters, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the ColecoVision system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later Coleco made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. Sega was also planning to release a version with Coleco.Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name \"Crazy Kong\" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel Donkey Kong Junior, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior. [CR]",

In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.[CR]Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.[CR]Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.[CR]In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.[CR]Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong Jr. was popular enough to have a Saturday morning TV cartoon based on it in the early 1980's. DK Jr. would often use \"Monkey Muscles\" as his catchphrase.[CR]Easter Eggs:[CR]During gameplay, move to a safe area and hold down either SHIFT key. While holding down the SHIFT key, type BOOGA and then let go of all keys. Now press the S key to skip levels or the K key to become invincible to falling threats.

It is a strategic war simulation of the Nazi Germany push into Soviet Russia.  Game turns continue over several seasons (with a total of 41 turns possible), and players plan out their moves for their units ahead of time.  When the execute button is pressed, combat and movement is carried out automatically, with the enemy units having more sophisticated moves the longer it took for you to take your turn.  Players control the German units, as the real challenge as winter sets in is to maintain lines of supply and prevent armored units from being stuck in terrain they can't negotiate.  When the spring thaw occurs, many areas change to mud, further hampering the German advance, reflecting the historical problems faced by the Axis forces during the war in the East.Different terrain types are in the game, including mountains, forest, river, swamps, seas, and cities, which affect movement and supply lines.  There were also several types of units for both sides, with the German armored divisions being the quickest and most durable.  Several units from other countries which were historically allied with the Germans are also represented, as well as Russian allies.  Russian armor is relatively weak compared to German armor, but Russian units on the whole respond better to poor weather, and have vastly superior reinforcements as the game progresses.  The AI's ability to increase the sophistication of its response had a drawback, though, as players could basically skip entire seasons of unfavorable weather by hitting the execute button repeatedly (though this was fixed in the cartridge version).  The computer calculation system was still far more complicated than most strategic systems for home computers at the time.Players were scored based on their surviving units, how many casualties inflicted on the enemy, and cities that were secured.

The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.",

However the caves are narrow and the enemy has still setup impact shields, defenses and Hyper-Chambers within their depths. [CR]Fort Apocalypse is a 4-way side-scrolling game, somewhat similar to Choplifter. The player takes the seat of a \"rocket copter\" and can move up, down, as well as left and right. However this helicopter takes time to turn between left and right perspectives, facing the \"front\" of the screen. While facing the front, the player is able to drop powerful plasma bombs which can destroy heavy weapons and doors. When facing directly left or right, the weapon used is a more maneuverable but weaker interceptor rocket. Displayed on the screen is a \"Navatron\", which functions as a radar showing terrain and enemies not yet on the map. Prisoners, once found can be landed on top of them in order to rescue them. There are also \"Hyper-Chambers\", which are glowing teleporters to other Hyper Chambers located on the same level. Fuel is constantly consumed while flying, but can be recharged at Fuel depots scattered throughout the level. There are also separate Landing Pads which will be the point at which a new helicopter is given to the player, should they be defeated in battle.[CR]Enemies include laser beams, teleporting rocks, breakable walls, self-propelled mines (SPM), armored tanks (which can only be destroyed from their treads), alien droids and hostile robo-choppers.",

The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galaxian (\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3) is an Arcade game that was developed by Namco and released in October 1979. It was published by Namco in Japan and imported to North America by Midway that December. A vertical scrolling shooter game in which the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and shoots enemies descending in various directions, it was designed to compete with Taito's successful earlier game Space Invaders (which was released in the previous year, and also imported to the US by Midway).The game was a big hit for Namco upon its release, and has been a focus of competitive gaming ever since.It was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Bally Astrocade, Nintendo Famicom, and home computers.It spawned a successful sequel, Galaga, in 1981, and the lesser known Gaplus and Galaga '88 in 1984 and 1987 respectively, as well as many later ports and adaptations. Along with its immediate sequel, it was one of the most popular games during the golden age of Arcade video games.[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by Space Invaders. As in the earlier game, Galaxian features a horde of attacking aliens that exchanged shots with the player. In contrast to Space Invaders, Galaxianadded an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make kamikaze-like dives at the player's ship, the Galaxip. This made it the first game to feature enemies with individual personalities. The game's plot consists of a title screen that displayed the message \"WE ARE THE GALAXIANS / MISSION: DESTROY ALIENS\".Galaxian was very successful for Namco and introduced several \"firsts\". Although not the first color video game, Galaxian took RGB color graphics a step further with multi-colored animated sprites and explosions, different colored fonts for the score and high score, the vertical scrolling starfield, and graphic icons that show the number of lives left and how many stages the player had completed. It also features a crude theme song and more prominent background music/sound effects. These elements combine to create a look and feel that would set the standard for arcade games in the 1980s such as Pac-Man.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The objective is destroy endless 'waves' of enemies. The enemy ships are arranged in a formation at the top of the screen. At regular intervals enemy ships on the sides of the formation swoop down and shoot at the player. There are 4 different types of enemy ship, each type behaves differently on its attacking run.The player must destroy all ships in a wave to complete it. With a minor exception that one yellow ship may disappear after a bombing run and will appear as an extra yellow ship in the following wave. The yellow ships attack in a formation with two red ships, the order these three are destroyed determines the points awarded for destroying the yellow. The maximum is 800 points if the two reds are destroyed first. Once a wave has been completed a red flag is added to the bottom of the screen. When 10 flags are accumulated they are replaced by a larger flag.The player has 3 lives at the beginning of the game. A bonus life is awarded when the player reaches a score of 7000 points. Once all lives have been lost the game ends. The player can only have one shot on screen at one time. This means if the player misses he must wait until the shot leaves the top of the screen to fire again. This makes accuracy very important.High ScoreThe current world record score for Galaxian is 1,653,270 points.[CR]Development and Release[CR]The game was developed by Namco in 1979, and released in Japan that year. It was designed to build and improve upon the formula of Taito's game Space Invaders, which revolutionized the gaming industry upon its release a year earlier. Galaxian incorporated new technology into its dedicated arcade system board, the Namco Galaxian. Unlike Space Invaders, which was black & white and featured enemies that could only move vertically and horizontally as they descended, Galaxian had a color screen and enemies that descended in patterns and came from various directions. The result was more complex and difficult game play.In 1980, Namco partnered with the American company Midway to release the game in North America. Midway had previously published Space Invaders in the market, but had to seek new foreign partners when Taito decided to market their games themselves.[CR]Reception of Ports[CR]Home Computing Weekly in 1983 gave the Spectrum version of Galaxian 3/5 stars describing it as a well-written version and praising the graphics as fast although flickery. Softline in 1983 criticized the Atari 8-bit version of the game for being shipped on cartridge, which raised its cost, and stated that \"this game becomes tedious very quickly\". Famicom Ts\u016bshin in 1995 scored the Game Boy version of the game a 24 out of 40.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Galaxian has spawned several follow-up games. The most popular of these was its immediate successor, Galaga, which largely eclipsed its predecessor in popularity, introducing aliens attacking in intricate formations, multiple shots, and bonus stages. A third official sequel, Gaplus, was released in 1984. As with Galaga, this was a fixed shooter, with limited vertical movement. However, by 1984, the novelty of the Space Invaders formula had faded, and it was no longer successful. A fourth sequel, Galaga '88, was released in 1987, and imported to North America by Atari Games. Namco then released Galaxian 3 in 1990. A final sequel, Galaga Arrangement, was released as part of the Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1, in 1995.PortsThe original arcade version of Galaxian has been ported to many different systems. These include:Apple IIAtari 400/800Atari 2600Atari 5200Bally Astrocade (Galactic Invasion)Coleco VFD table topColecoVisionCommodore VIC-20Commodore 64DreamcastGame Boy (bundled with its direct successor, Galaga)IBM PCMobile JavaMSX (Europe and Japan only)NEC PC-8801Nintendo Famicom Disk System (Japan only)Sharp X1Virtual Console (Japan only)ZX SpectrumColeco also released stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabeletop versions of Galaxian, which, along with Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Frogger, sold three million units combined. A port for the Game Boy Color was planned, but never released.Moon Alien Part 2Nichibutsu released a modified version of this game for the arcades as Moon Alien Part 2. Besides the graphics, the only main difference between this and Galaxian is the inclusion of an energy meter that drains with every second the player spends clearing a wave. If the player doesn't clear the wave before running out of energy, the ship is destroyed.Arcade sequelsMain: Galaxian (franchise) Galaga (1981)Gaplus (1984)Galaga '88 (1987)Galaga Arrangement (1995) - released as part of Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1Galaxian was one of the most widely pirated motherboards during the early '80s. Numerous hacks were made of the game and featured slightly redesigned enemy characters and special bonus stages. The scrolling starfield and death explosion were still familiar as those from Galaxian, however. These hacks include: Galaxian Part 4, Galaxian Part X, Galaxian Turbo, and Super Galaxians.3D sequelsGalaxian\u00b3 (1990) - Galaxian\u00b3: Project Dragoon (Theatre 6) for six players on two 110-inch RGB projectors - 18-foot-wide (5.5 m) screenAttack of the Zolgear (1994) - a ROM and laserdisc upgrade for Galaxian\u00b3 [CR]",

These include: fighting with the equipped weapon, a LOCATE spell to discover traps in the room, a SEARCH spell to discover hidden doors inside of room which would otherwise look like ordinary walls.  Players may also use many of the items and scrolls that can be picked up in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which include weaponry (swords, bows and arrows), healing slaves, precious items and magical scrolls. Most items are only good for a single use.[CR]The Gateway to Apshai is guarded by an assortment of creatures including snakes, swamp rats, bats and many more. These enemies are only visible when they are in the same room as the player and are otherwise hidden.

Along the way, enemy spaceships, lasers, and meteors will appear and must be destroyed before the player can advance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Upon starting the game, players will be greeted with the message \"2 WARPS TO NEPTUNE\". Each level means the player is one warp closer to reaching the planet. Killing all enemies that appear in the level will complete the warp. The opposing spaceships will fly towards the player's ship in a pattern, often curving around the tube perspective and flying back towards the center, where they will wait. Enemy ships who are not shot while waiting in the center will fly off screen and reappear flying out from the center. Completing all the warps will display a quick cutscene of the player ship zooming towards Neptune. Next, a small bonus round called the Change Stage will start. The ships in the Chance Stage will not shoot back, allowing the player to rack up points with ease.In the arcade version of Gyruss, gameplay remains the same as the player warps from Neptune to Uranus, then Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and eventually Earth. The final level, \"3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE\", is extremely fast. Completing it restarts the game over at two warps to Neptune.In the NES version, the player starts at the edge of the Solar System, then warps to Neptune, Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, and finishes the game at The Sun.PerspectiveThe ship sprites will shrink as they move farther down the 'tube'The most unique feature of Gyruss is the perspective: the field of play is a similar to a giant abstract tube with the player's ship flying through. Enemies will most often appear at the center of the 'tube' and fly outward to give the effect of rapid approach. On occasion, 'flocks' of enemy ships will fly out from the left or right side of the screen, breaking the tube perspective.PortsGyruss proved to be a bit of a success for Konami, and ports were soon made for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64. A port to the European ZX Spectrum was also planned, but later scrapped. In 2007, an Xbox Live Arcade port of Gyruss was released with updated sound and graphics. Gyruss has found its way onto several Konami compilations, such as the Playstation Konami Arcade Classics and Konami Collector's Series: Arcade Advanced for the Game Boy Advance. Gyruss is said to be coming to Microsoft's Game Room for the Xbox 360 and PC in July 2010.Differences between the NES remake and the Arcade versionIn 1988, Konami released Gyruss to The Famicom Disk System/ Nintendo Entertainment System under the Ultra Games label. This version was much more of a remake than a mere port. Along with a slight hint of story came improved art, new music, boss battles, more planets to warp to, added Chance Stages, and different power ups. A major difference in the story was that it featured Genghis Khan as a villain.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Excerpt from the Atari 5200 Gyruss manual -Within each warp you'll face FOUR different formations of enemy planes. The formations might emerge from the center of the screen where the planes band together--or form off screen where they can create a surprise attack. In either case, shoot down as many planes within the formation as you can and don't let them hit your own ship. Planes fire missiles, too...your only option is to avoid them...or be shot down. After the last formation appears, all the planes NOT shot down will regroup in the center and attack again. They will continue to do so until you've eliminated the last one--unless, of course, one eliminates you first.BUT PLANES ARE NOT ALL YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE ARE SWIRLING AND DEADLY SATELLITES AND METEORS, TOO.There are several reoccurring types of enemies in Gyruss: enemy ships, asteroids, satellites, and laser generators.Enemy ships will fly in formation from either the center (giving the illusion of depth) or from the left and right side of the screen. They will then head back to the center of the screen, growing smaller in size as they get away from the player ship. Ships in the middle of the screen can still be shot at, and neglecting to do so will cause the enemy ship to fly away and reappear later.Asteroids are round, blue blobs that start in the middle of the screen and suddenly zoom past the player. Asteroids will never change position in the 'tube' and are easily avoided.Satellites will phase into view usually right in front of the player ship and follow it around for a time. The satellites include three sections, the blue triangles, and the spiky orange middle. Shooting the orange spiky ball in the middle will double the player's firepower.The final type of enemy in the arcade version of Gyruss are the laser generators. Each generator consists of two small blue circles with yellow energy pulsing between them. Similar to asteroids, lasers will never change position and moving out of the way is the simplest way of combating them. Another way to stop the threat of laser generators is to shoot one of the two small blue circles holding the laser beam in place. This will stop the beam from pulsing and destroy the circle the player shot at, but the other half will remain on the screen and fly past like an asteroid.Like many old arcade games, all enemies are on a set pattern and basic memorization is key for high scores.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Gryuss makes a brief cameo in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.As with many Konami games, the Konami Code can be entered into the title screen of the NES remake, albeit backwards (A B A B right left right left down down up up).The main theme of Gyruss is a contemporary arrangement of Johan Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.An even more fast-paced and electronic arrangement of the Gyruss theme can be found in Konami's Dance Dance Revolution: ULTRAMIX 2 under the name GYRUSS -FULL TILT-.According to TwinGalaxies, the highest score ever recorded for the arcade version of Gyruss was Michael Bangs's perfect score of 47,024,400.Gyruss creator Yoshiki Okamoto was fired after the release of the game due to financial disputes. He then joined Capcom where he would later produce 1942 and Street Fighter II.After making Gyruss, Yoshiki Okamoto created another classic shoot 'em up, Time Pilot.The Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 ports of Gyruss were released by Parker Brothers.According to an article in Electronic Gaming Monthly, a lifeform from the planet Gyruss is known as a Gyrussian.[CR]",

It was originally developed for the                    Atari 2600 but ported to many other consoles already listed on this page. The name is speculated to mean \"Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation\".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   The main objective of the game is to rescue trapped miners. You're equipped with a       heli-pack  allowing you to          fly around the level, as well as a               laser-beam to defend yourself from the game's various enemies (             bats,             snakes,            spiders, etc). You're also equipped with           dynamite, which you can use to kill  enemies or to destroy various walls blocking your way. It's possible to use your laser beam to disintegrate the wall as well without the risk of killing yourself, although it takes longer. There are      magma walls later in the game that kill you if you touch them, making it slightly harder to plant dynamite next to, or navigate through the caverns. When you die, you're returned to the same screen as the one you were just on, costing a life. There is a        power meter on the bottom of the screen that slowly drains indicating a time limit, making later levels fairly difficult due to their length. When the power meter is drained, you lose a life. Later levels often feature a raft the player can use to float across the water unharmed.

The main character is a knight, but unlike medieval knights he rides a yellow flying ostrich. The object is to get to the next level , called a wave, without being defeated by enemy knights, who ride mounted upon flying vultures.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jousting is hard work.The object of Joust is to defeat all of the other jousters on the stage. This can be done by making contact with them while the player's jouster's jousting spear is higher than the enemy's is. As long as this is the case when the player's jouster collides with an enemy, they will be defeated. To ensure that an enemy jouster will not return, however, it is necessary to pick up the egg that is dropped when they are defeated. If the egg isn't collected quickly, it will hatch into another jouster and another buzzard will quickly arrive to pick him up and return him to the fight.There are lava pits on either side of the island on the lowest level of the battleground. In the early stages these pits will be sealed so that falling into them is impossible, but eventually they will open up and become a hazard to both the player and the enemies. Living in the lava is a lava troll who will grab any character that flies too close to it, players and enemies, and attempt to drag them down into the lava. It is possible to escape the troll when caught by flying hard enough.An enemy pterodactyl appears if too much time elapses in a stage. The beast appears to be unbeatable, but it can actually be killed by stabbing it directly in its mouth when it is open. This is difficult however because the creature moves much faster than other enemies. It will also leave if all the other jousters on the stage are defeated.[CR]Ports[CR]Joust has appeared on nearly every popular gaming system to date in some form or another. Usually it is packaged into a \"best of\" package but more recently it has been sold stand-alone on popular download services such as Xbox Live Marketplace and on the PlayStation Network.Joust was ported and released on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace. The game was unscaled to appear in HD and was sold for 400 Microsoft points or $5.Joust was also ported to the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, sold for $4.99 and published by Sony Online Entertainment.[CR]",

The game was originally called Jungle King and featured Tarzan as the protagonist, but due to copyright issues over his use, it was changed to Jungle Hunt.The first level features vine swings of varying distances, where perfect timing is required to proceed.The second level is a side-scrolling swimming challenge that pits the explorer against crocodiles. Armed with a knife, the player can choose to avoid or stab, with extra points awarded for stabbing a crocodile with its mouth open.The last level is a side-scrolling boulder jump, with a voodoo doctor end boss. Boulders of different sizes, speeds and intervals enter from the right side of the screen, and the player must leap over them. As more boulders enter the screen, timing becomes critical. The end boss shakes from side to side and leaps very high in the air. Successful completion requires timing a run directly beneath the boss character as he leaps.Like many 2600 games, the game allows you to start back at the beginning to replay at a higher difficulty.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The home console version of the game was designed for use with the classic Atari 2600 joystick controller.Level 1: Stick moves character up and down on vine. Button initiates jump.Level 2: Stick moves character up down left right. Button stabs knife.Level 3: Stick moves Character left and right. Button jumps.[CR]",

The game ends when all of your reserve lives have been lost. Each sector of the game has a timer bar; if you complete a sector while the bar is in the green or yellow section, bonus points are earned. If the timer runs out, you lose a life. Each sector will have one or more exits in the maze; you may exit a maze at any time, but if you leave before all of the robots are destroyed then you will have to go back two sectors.",

With a gameplay style somewhat similar to Breakout, the player uses a paddle (2600 version) or joystick (5200 version) to control the action.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] takes place on a single screen. The Mad Bomber, at the top of the screen glides left and right while dropping bombs. The player controls a series of three buckets, which are used to catch the bombs before they land at the bottom of the screen. As gameplay progresses, the Mad Bomber moves and drops bombs more rapidly, increasing difficulty. Points are scored on a sliding scale; the more groups of bombs caught, the more points are awarded - 8 groups giving the maximum multiplier. Each bomb group comes faster, and has more bombs than the prior.DifficultyThe difficulty switches control the width of the buckets. The 'B' level difficulty decreases the bucket size to less than half of the 'A' level difficulty. The difficulty does not affect scoring.Missed BombsIf the player misses a bomb, the score multiplier is reset, and the player loses a bucket, increasing the challenge on subsequent attempts. Gameplay resumes one bomb set prior to the current bomb set, but with half as many bombs to catch. When all buckets are gone, the game is over. Scoring 1000 points earns the player a new bucket, with a maximum of three earned buckets. Earned buckets may not be stockpiled; a player must earn 1000 points subsequent to losing a bucket to gain a new one. Because missed bombs lower the difficulty, a high level strategy is to purposely miss a bomb around the 900 mark, if successful the player will be easily able to regain an extra bucked while at the same time slowing the onslaught of bombs.ModesThe Atari 2600 version of Kaboom! features 2-player alternating play, with independent difficulty selection. The 5200 version additionally supports a mode whereby players alternate between controlling the buckets, and the Mad Bomber.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Like all Activision releases of this era, the box, manual and cartridge label all feature the name of the designer of that particular game. In this case, Larry Kaplan. Additionally, Larry Kaplan provided several gameplay tips at the back of the instruction manual.The mad bomber has a \"sad face\" while dropping bombs, but a \"happy face\" if one gets by the player. A score of 10,000 points leads to an easter-egg: a surprised face, regardless of the action.As with many Activision games, a patch was available for excellent gameplay. Providing activision with a photograph of a score of 3000 or better would get that player a free \"Bucket Brigade\" patch.Activision released an LCD keychain version of the game in the early 1990s.

The game utilized the Atari 2600 joystick to help mother maneuver, \"Donkey Kong\" type level designs.  Every different direction on the joystick would send mother ducking or leaping from ledges or to collect scattered fruit for points.  The red button on the joystick controlled her \"boxing,\" which was frequently needed to fight of the onslaught of evil monkeys bent on keeping baby kangaroo kidnapped.  The game was remembered as being especially difficult as you start the game with 3 lives and no continues.Kangaroo is another gem by yesterday's standards, but remains a formidable challenge to any newcomer to the games design.In one of the levels that broke with the game's usual ascent format, your joey is on top of a column of monkeys that you must punch repeatedly in order to knock each monkey out from other the platform your joey is on.  You punch the HELL out of those monkeys, I can tell you.The game uses Stephen Foster's song \"O! Suzanna!\" to signal level completion (when your little joey says MOM in big letters after you rescue him or her).  When ringing the bell to bring in the next selection of fruit, you hear the Westminster Quarters song (often heard in college campuses). As you get closer to the top of each level a gorilla will come out and want to box you.  It's best to avoid him and keep going till you reach the top.[CR]",

If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit.

The more soldiers you save the more points you get, and the first to reach 999 points is the winner and savior.GameplayIn the default game type, the first objective is to retrieve wounded from the battlefield to your M*A*S*H (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) via helicopter. Your chopper may carry up to five soldiers before it has to go drop them off at the hospital, There are two minor obstacles hindering you from achieving your mission. The first most apparent type of obstacles are the trees. These aren't much of a factor but do sometimes create bottlenecks when trying to move around your opponent or trying to dodge the second type of obstacle, Anti-Aircraft fire. One solitary unit firing at both you and your opponent. If you get hit, you fall from the sky and you get dragged off the screen by a salvage vehicle costing you precious time. But this is still only a minor annoyance seeing that one second after the wreckage leaves the screen another helicopter appears at your M*A*S*H ready to go pick up more soldiers. After a set amount of time, this first part of the game suddenly stops and you move on to the second objective, operating on the wounded. This new screen reminds me of the board game Operation. All you see is a poorly drawn, really fat man, with shrapnel in his body that you must remove in order to save him. Using the tool given, you must pick up that shrapnel/bullet and guide it through the maze and out of the body. On each successful surgery you gain points, and move on to the next patient. On the other hand if you bump the fragment against the body, or edge of the maze, a hideous buzzing sound akin to Operation lets you know you have killed the patient. Then, staying true to the source material, you are promptly called a Ferret Face. The consequence of killing your patient is that you and lose the opportunity to save any more. Once again assuming you keep saving them you only have a set amount of time to save as many as you can.VariantsThere is one major variant to this game. As opposed to picking up soldiers from the ground and bringing them back to base, there is a mode where you and your opponent must catch soldiers being dropped from the sky by a jet. Once again this only lasts for a set amount of time before moving on to the operating table part of the game. Also there are couple of difficulty changes including: smaller helicopters which makes it easier to navigate through trees, and provides a smaller target for the AA gun, and the second possible change being the lack of AA gunfire.[CR]",

It was designed by Steve Cartwright, and was later ported to Atari 8-bit and Atari 5200, with some minor interface/graphical improvements, by Glyn Anderson. Insofar as the game has a plot, it takes place in a Space Nightmare, brought on by the protagonist, a pilot on an intergalactic space cruiser, consuming two pepperoni pizzas and a quart of chocolate mint ice cream. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Megamania is a fairly traditional shoot em up.The player controls a spaceship visually similar to the Starship Enterprise armed with a laser cannon. A time restraint in the form of an contiuously dwindling energy bar is displayed on the bottom of the screen, and when this runs out, the player loses one of his three initial ships. The ship can be moved left and right, and shoot, and that is the full extent of the player's control of it.  As usual with Atari 2600 games, the game has several gameplay modes; the player can select to have missiles that follow the sideways motion of the spaceship, or missiles that fire straight, independent of the spaceship. The game's enemies feature a typically early 80s variety of random foodstuffs and geometric shapes, which come at your space ship in increasingly intricate patterns as you progress through the levels.  Scoring is performed by killing enemies, and the points awarded for each kill increase from level to level. The player is also awarded for finishing levels quickly, as the remaining energy bar is also tallied into the score. Should the total score exceed 999.999 points, the game crashes, as a result of a programming error.  The lyrics to the theme song bear mentioning. It was performed by The Tubes, a San Fransisco-based rock band. \"Mega! Megamania. Megamania!! It's gonna drive you insane. You've got to shoot to survive, you've got to run to stay alive! You may regret it, the day you get it- It's never gonna let you alone!\"[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Millipede is the sequel to Atari's Centipede. Designed by Ed Logg, it takes some of the familiar elements from Centipede and changes them graphically, while adding completely new elements, including new enemies and a new weapon. The arcade game features a trackball controller for precise movement.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is similar to the Centipede's: Players control the Archer, a shooter bounded by the bottom third of the screen. Only one bullet can be on-screen at a time. If struck once by any enemy or bullet, the Archer is destroyed. The game field is populated with mushrooms which serve as obstacles, minor points when destroyed, and can be used by enemy and the player to block or accelerate movement of the main enemy, the millipede.Once all of a millipede is destroyed, all mushrooms move down one step toward the player field, and the next round starts, usually marked by a new swarm of enemies and the color of the playfield changing. [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The Millipede is the focus of the game, and moves predictably. Shooting it in one of its middle sections will spawn two millipedes with the remaining body length. The millipede will divide in this way each time it is shot, unless the head or tail segments are shot. When the millipede reaches the bottom, in addition to spawning new heads, the body will break up and plague the Archer's playfield. Spiders function as in Centipede, consuming mushrooms and jumping erratically, mostly within the player zone. The player gets a higher score if the spider is shot when it is very near the Archer. Should a spider eat many mushrooms, a Bee (the equivalent of the Flea from Centipede) is likely to spawn. Bees fly in a straight line from the top of the screen down to the bottom, spawning mushrooms in its wake. It can be killed by multiple shots, and is spawned when there are few if any mushrooms. This requirement can cause many Bees to be spawned in succession as they try to repopulate the playing field with mushrooms. Dragonflies act similarly to the Bee, spawning mushrooms. Its flight pattern is that of a wave, making it harder to hit. Unlike the Bee, they only have a single hit point. They also spawn more mushrooms on average than Bees do. The Earwig poisons mushrooms. It starts near the top of the screen, moving left or right, and any mushroom it runs across becomes poisoned. A poisoned mushroom is worth more points, but also sends the millipede directly down the screen. The Earwig is one of the top scoring targets in the game. Beetles are slow, but when they run over mushrooms they actually transform them into flowers, which are indestructible.The Beetle also moves in a 'U' shaped attack pattern, entering the screen at a side, then moving down near the bottom, then ascending before it leaves, threatening the Archer with collision and converting mushrooms into impenetrable obstacles. Killing a Beetle makes mushrooms move down one row. All flowers become mushrooms again when a life is lost. Mosquitos fly down at a 45 degree angle. When killed, all mushrooms move up one row, clearing them away from the player zone. This may destroy DDT bombs and prompt Bee spawning.[CR]Beneficial or benign Creatures and Objects[CR]The mushroom is the mainstay of the game. It has multiple hit points and can block the Archer from moving. It can also help to corral millipedes, making them easier to hit. Any mushroom partially destroyed is restored when killed, resulting in a small bonus. A poisoned mushroom is one touched by an Earwig. It is worth more points when destroyed, and is restored to normal upon death. Flowers are Beetle-converted mushrooms, and are indestructible. They revert to regular mushrooms and give points similar to the way partially destroyed mushrooms do. DDT Bombs spawn at the top of the screen as mushrooms do when a Beetle or Millipede is fully killed. Shooting the bomb results in a cloud of lateral smoke in both directions. Any enemy caught in the cloud is instantly killed and scored. Inchworms are creatures that are beneficial if shot. Shooting one causes the game to slow down for a short period of time, making targeting enemies much easier.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Millipede body segment: 10 pointsMillipede head: 100 pts.Spider (long distance): 300 pts.Spider (mid-distance): 600 pts.Spider (short distance): 900 pts.Spider (point blank): 1200 pts.Spider (with DDT Bomb): 1800 pts.Beetle: 300 pts.Mosquito: 400 pts.Bee: 200 pts.Inchworm: 100 pts.DDT Bomb: 800 pts.Dragonfly: 500 pts.Earwig: 1000 pts.Mushroom: 1 pt.Mushroom regeneration: 5 pts. per poisoned, partly destroyed, or enflowered mushroom upon death Swarms, which happen every 4th round, give bonus points for every successive insect obliterated. They are made up of different insects depending on the round, and can net a large bonus if enough are shot.[CR]Round Progression[CR]Every five rounds, mushrooms regenerate on their own. They obey the laws laid down by mathematician John Horton Conway in his  Game of Life, with some special exceptions: DDT bombs poisoning neighboring mushrooms (naturally), and mushrooms adjacent to poisoned mushrooms dying off. Flowers count as mushrooms to determine if they generate or kill off others, or kill off themselves. There are spider swarm waves which have as many as eight spiders on the screen at once (instead of the usual two) and waves where mushrooms move down much quicker than normal, making it much harder to maneuver and control the environment.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Millipede is the sequel to Atari's Centipede. Designed by Ed Logg, it takes some of the familiar elements from Centipede and changes them graphically, while adding completely new elements, including new enemies and a new weapon. The arcade game features a trackball controller for precise movement.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is similar to the Centipede's: Players control the Archer, a shooter bounded by the bottom third of the screen. Only one bullet can be on-screen at a time. If struck once by any enemy or bullet, the Archer is destroyed. The game field is populated with mushrooms which serve as obstacles, minor points when destroyed, and can be used by enemy and the player to block or accelerate movement of the main enemy, the millipede.Once all of a millipede is destroyed, all mushrooms move down one step toward the player field, and the next round starts, usually marked by a new swarm of enemies and the color of the playfield changing. [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The Millipede is the focus of the game, and moves predictably. Shooting it in one of its middle sections will spawn two millipedes with the remaining body length. The millipede will divide in this way each time it is shot, unless the head or tail segments are shot. When the millipede reaches the bottom, in addition to spawning new heads, the body will break up and plague the Archer's playfield. Spiders function as in Centipede, consuming mushrooms and jumping erratically, mostly within the player zone. The player gets a higher score if the spider is shot when it is very near the Archer. Should a spider eat many mushrooms, a Bee (the equivalent of the Flea from Centipede) is likely to spawn. Bees fly in a straight line from the top of the screen down to the bottom, spawning mushrooms in its wake. It can be killed by multiple shots, and is spawned when there are few if any mushrooms. This requirement can cause many Bees to be spawned in succession as they try to repopulate the playing field with mushrooms. Dragonflies act similarly to the Bee, spawning mushrooms. Its flight pattern is that of a wave, making it harder to hit. Unlike the Bee, they only have a single hit point. They also spawn more mushrooms on average than Bees do. The Earwig poisons mushrooms. It starts near the top of the screen, moving left or right, and any mushroom it runs across becomes poisoned. A poisoned mushroom is worth more points, but also sends the millipede directly down the screen. The Earwig is one of the top scoring targets in the game. Beetles are slow, but when they run over mushrooms they actually transform them into flowers, which are indestructible.The Beetle also moves in a 'U' shaped attack pattern, entering the screen at a side, then moving down near the bottom, then ascending before it leaves, threatening the Archer with collision and converting mushrooms into impenetrable obstacles. Killing a Beetle makes mushrooms move down one row. All flowers become mushrooms again when a life is lost. Mosquitos fly down at a 45 degree angle. When killed, all mushrooms move up one row, clearing them away from the player zone. This may destroy DDT bombs and prompt Bee spawning.[CR]Beneficial or benign Creatures and Objects[CR]The mushroom is the mainstay of the game. It has multiple hit points and can block the Archer from moving. It can also help to corral millipedes, making them easier to hit. Any mushroom partially destroyed is restored when killed, resulting in a small bonus. A poisoned mushroom is one touched by an Earwig. It is worth more points when destroyed, and is restored to normal upon death. Flowers are Beetle-converted mushrooms, and are indestructible. They revert to regular mushrooms and give points similar to the way partially destroyed mushrooms do. DDT Bombs spawn at the top of the screen as mushrooms do when a Beetle or Millipede is fully killed. Shooting the bomb results in a cloud of lateral smoke in both directions. Any enemy caught in the cloud is instantly killed and scored. Inchworms are creatures that are beneficial if shot. Shooting one causes the game to slow down for a short period of time, making targeting enemies much easier.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Millipede body segment: 10 pointsMillipede head: 100 pts.Spider (long distance): 300 pts.Spider (mid-distance): 600 pts.Spider (short distance): 900 pts.Spider (point blank): 1200 pts.Spider (with DDT Bomb): 1800 pts.Beetle: 300 pts.Mosquito: 400 pts.Bee: 200 pts.Inchworm: 100 pts.DDT Bomb: 800 pts.Dragonfly: 500 pts.Earwig: 1000 pts.Mushroom: 1 pt.Mushroom regeneration: 5 pts. per poisoned, partly destroyed, or enflowered mushroom upon death Swarms, which happen every 4th round, give bonus points for every successive insect obliterated. They are made up of different insects depending on the round, and can net a large bonus if enough are shot.[CR]Round Progression[CR]Every five rounds, mushrooms regenerate on their own. They obey the laws laid down by mathematician John Horton Conway in his  Game of Life, with some special exceptions: DDT bombs poisoning neighboring mushrooms (naturally), and mushrooms adjacent to poisoned mushrooms dying off. Flowers count as mushrooms to determine if they generate or kill off others, or kill off themselves. There are spider swarm waves which have as many as eight spiders on the screen at once (instead of the usual two) and waves where mushrooms move down much quicker than normal, making it much harder to maneuver and control the environment.[CR]",

The game became so incredibly popular, that over the years it has been remade by various companies under different names, and sometimes even slightly different graphics. A few examples of these are  Commando Raid,  Lunar Command, and  Condition Red.[CR]",

[CR]Remakes[CR]Missile Command was originally released in  arcades in 1980 and ported to the  Atari 2600, from there it was made on the  Atari 5200 and the  Atari 8-bit, as well as other consoles. The game became so incredibly popular, that over the years it has been remade by various companies under different names, and sometimes even slightly different graphics. A few examples of these are  Commando Raid,  Lunar Command, and  Condition Red.[CR]",

This requires blind exploration, based on the general layout of previous levels, before locating the torch and revealing the platforms for the rest of the level. However, the last level of the game is entirely dark and no torches are available.Between levels, the player falls through areas populated only by gold bars and chains.

It is a side-scrolling shooter that puts players at the controls of a six-wheeled moon rover that can jump and shoot. The goal is to move through the entire course as quickly as possible while shooting enemies for additional points. Cannons are mounted on the front and top of the vehicle, and both fire simultaneously when the fire button is pressed. Rocks, mines, and pits in the course prevent you from just holding to the right for maximum speed. Rocks and mines can be shot, but pits must be jumped. Some enemies fire shots that create new pits in the course, forcing players to react quickly.The course is broken up into multiple checkpoints, each denoted by a letter. Some checkpoints (\"E,\" for example) cause the game to stop, check your time, award bonus points for fast movement, and send you on your way. When the end is reached, a further bonus is awarded and the player returns to the first checkpoint.As with many games of its era, Moon Patrol was ported around to several different home platforms.[CR]Television Reference[CR]On the popular T.V. show, Psych, the episode tuesday the 17th, you can hear a direct reference to Moon Patrol and actully see gameplay.[CR]",

After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. [CR]At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.[CR]Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.[CR]The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.",

Pressing the lone action button while facing an ice block will cause Pengo to push forward the block, which will slide until it hits a wall or another ice block. The ice block will also crush any Sno-Bees in the line of trajectory. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees at once will increase the number of points awarded.There are a total of sixteen levels, which repeat in order after completing the sixteenth level.As the player dispatches enemies, new Sno-Bees hatch from eggs located within other ice blocks within the level. Eggs can be eliminated by crushing the ice blocks that contain them. At the beginning of each new level, the ice blocks with eggs within them will momentarily flash a color showing the level of Sno-Bee inside. Pengo can briefly stun Sno-Bees by pushing a side wall, causing the water to ripple. This stun will only effect adjacent Sno-Bees to the player character. When stunned the Sno-Bees can be run over by Pengo. Each level ends when all Sno-Bees have been eliminated.Diamond blocks located within the level are unbreakable. When diamond blocks are oriented into a vertical or horizontal line the player is awarded 5,000 to 10,000 bonus points depending on whether the line is against a wall or not. The alignment of the diamond blocks will also temporarily stun all Sno-Bees within the level.When 60 seconds have elapsed in a round without the player dying, the game enters into a sudden death mode; the music speeds up and the movement speed of the Sno-Bees increases.ScoringThe points award for crushing Sno-Bees is dependant on the number crushed in one push of an ice block:400 points for 1 Sno-Bee1,600 points for 2 Sno-Bees3,200 points for 3 Sno-Bees6,400 points for 4 Sno-Bees100 points for walking over a stunned Sno-Bee10,000 points for aligning the three diamond blocks together if at least one is not touching a wall, but only 5,000 if all are against the walls.30 pointe for crushing an ice block or 500 points if the ice block contains a Sno-Bee egg.A bonus is awarded for time left after completion of a round:5,000 points for under 20 seconds2,000 points for between 20\u201329 seconds1,000 points for between 30\u201339 seconds500 points for between 40\u201349 seconds10 points for between 50\u201359 seconds0 points for 60 seconds or moreAn extra life is awarded at 30,000 pointsWorld Record High ScoreAccording to Twin Galaxies the world record score for Pengo is held by Rodney Day from Canberra, Australia. His score of 1,110,370 points was set on August 13, 1983.Easter EggThe credits can be displayed by holding both joysticks up, pressing both action buttons and pressing one start game button at the same time while the game is in \"Attract Mode\"[CR]",

Players control the character Pitfall Harry and have to guide him through a dense forest filled with deadly obstacles such as snakes, scorpions, rolling logs, alligator infested swamps, and bottomless pits.The game had many basic gameplay elements that are now common in all platformers. Harry had the ability to jump, swing, climb ladders and run left or right on the screen. The game places Harry on the left side of the screen by default, but a player could choose to tackle the jungle by going right on the screen. The game also had many secret passages which could be used as shortcuts.[CR]Release History[CR]Pitfall! was created in 1982 by Activision employee David Crane. The game was a technical achievement in that it had multiple animated sprites of varying colors with no flickering. Pitfall! introduced the basic concept of having a character jump around to avoid obstacles and collect items, which is now the basis for all platformers. The game was a massive success on the Atari 2600 and had ports for numerous game systems afterwards.The character in the game is lovingly referred to as Pitfall Harry.[CR][B]Fun Facts:[/B][CR]Pitfall! was used in an episode of South Park in which Father Maxy had to traverse a series of levels (with himself being the main character) to retrieve a lost scroll hidden in the catacombs of The Vatican.In 1982, then-unknown actor Jack Black was in a Pitfall! commercial.Actor Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame would eventually play the voice of Pitfall Harry in the Playstation version of the game.When Pitfall! was originally sold, anyone who scored above 20,000 points could send Activision a picture of his or her television screen to receive a Pitfall Harry's Explorers' Club patch.In Marvel Ultimate Alliance, the player must complete a game of Pitfall! using their own character in order to proceed in a mission.In Call Of Duty: Black Ops II: this game is playable through a secret in the Nuketown 2025 map.[CR]",

Pitfall II maintains much of the look and feel of the first game, but it opens the world up into a free-roaming adventure, rather than progressing on a linear path.  Pitfall Harry's quest in Pitfall II is to collect a diamond, find his niece Rhonda, and his cowardly lion companion, Quickclaw. Upon collecting all three, the quest ends. In most versions of the game, this is also the end of the game. On the Atari 8-bit versions of the game, Pitfall II contained a \"second quest\" with more difficult enemies, a more challenging level layout, and new items to collect.[CR]Significance[CR]Pitfall II is advanced for its time, and especially for the 2600 version of the game relative to the other games for that system.  It features save points, which allow you to continue again from the last cross symbol you stepped over.  When you die, sad music will play and your character will physically return to the save point while your score is deducted relative to the distance traveled back to the cross.The heroic music that runs through the game is fairly catchy, even by today's chip tune standards.  Not exactly an objective statement, but  give it a listen.  The music also changes to a slightly more downbeat version should you spend too much time not grabbing shiny loot.Among the game play modes there are the requisite running and jumping  found in the original Pitfall, along with swimming and ascending a chasm using a hot air balloon.  The enemies have also been increased to include bats (which also pop your balloons), poisonous frogs, and electric eels for the swimming portions. [CR]",

While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.",

But, the saving grace of this cartridge is that it isn't really about running away to join the circus. Rather, it's a horizontal action game of skill that gets so fast so soon, it can provide a tasty challenge.[CR]When you start it up, Plattermania is instantly pleasing to the eye. Your player, a yellow clown who we'll call Bozo, waits behind a long table. On the table are a row of 12 evenly spaced upright sticks or stands. When you hit the red button on your paddle controller, Bozo reaches up and puts a spinning platter on the stand touching his hat. After a while, the platter starts to wobble-a pretty good 3-D effect-then it wobbles more and finally it falls. You can spin the platter to keep it from falling by positioning Bozo behind it and hitting the red button. Hit the button twice and the platter will fly off the stick and crash. (The exception is that when it's really wobbling badly, you have to give it two or even three spins.)[CR]Keeping the platters spinning for 8 seconds is all there is to it. There are no different screens. This clown act is the entire circus![CR]Sounds simple? It is in the beginning. In the first level, all you have to do is put your platters up. They take about eight seconds to wobble and 25 seconds to fall. But, by round eight, things are really cooking. To keep the platters spinning, you've got to whip Bozo's butt up and down that line. I found this doable after 20 minutes of getting the hand of it. But, by the last round, the platters start to wobble in one second and fall in five. By the time I could get to the end of the row, the first platter had nearly smashed![CR]The problem is that Plattermania can get old on you, since it only gets faster, never different. How much time do you want to spend spinning platters?[CR]At higher levels, don't even look of the plotters. Just keep whipping down the row hitting the trigger button as you pass each stick.[CR][Electronic Fun - Vol. 1, No. 5 March,1983][CR]",

Its cabinet is the same design as the earlier more recognizable Donkey Kong and the later Donkey Kong Jr. cabinets. A cocktail table version was also released. The game was designed by Genyo Takeda and a young upstart designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. The Popeye characters were originally going to be used for Donkey Kong, but Nintendo decided to go with an original character creation that evolved into the iconic Mario. The CPU was a Z80 Chip running at 4MHz. Sound was produced using a AY8910 chip running at 2MHz. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Three Stages of PopeyeTHE DOCK STAGE - Popeye must catch 24 hearts that Olive Oyl tosses down one at a time. The HUD displays how many hearts the player has collected. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a life if he doesn't retrieve the breaking heart after about 10 seconds.Bluto chases Popeye throughout the stage. There are two ways he can be temporarily disposed of. One is by punching the signature can of spinach that will periodically appear on the sides of the screen. Once the can is punched, Popeye gets stong and turns red for about 10 seconds and has the ability to punch Bluto, sending him bouncing across the screen and into the sea. Catching hearts while in this 'red mode' will also net double points. The player will get 3000 points knocking out Bluto but he will shortly climb back out and continue his pursuit. The second way he can be incapacitated is by hitting a punching bag that dislodges a bucket. If timed right, the bucket will fall on Bluto's head giving the player 2000 points and some time to grabs some more hearts before he eventually pulls the bucket off.Both Bluto and the Sea Hag like to throw bottles at Popeye. These bottles can be broken by punching them. Bluto throws his bottles in groups of four and the Sea Hag will periodically show up on the side of the screen, throw one and disappear. Sometimes there will will be one on each side and they'll simultaneously throw a bottle, attempting to 'sandwich' Popeye between them is he isn't fast enough with his punches. Bluto can also jump up to a higher level or reach down to a lower level to knock Popeye out. Players should take caution when passing Bluto directly above or below him.THE STREET STAGE - This stage is similar to the first but features a different level layout and Olive throws musical notes instead of hearts. There is also a seesaw located in the lower left corner that, if timed right, allows Popeye to be launched in the air, thanks to Wimpy standing on the other end. Once in the air, Popeye can touch Sweet Pea for a point bonus who is floating above with a balloon.THE SHIP STAGE - The final stage features similar gameplay with two different features. One is there is a sliding platform at the top. Second each time Popeye catches one of the H-E-L-P letters that Olive tosses him, a ladder step will appear. Once enough letters are caught and the ladder is completed, Popeye can climb up and rescue Olive. The Sea Hag's pet vulture will also come out on the left side of the screen. Popeye can punch it continuously for points.Once Popeye rescues Olive, players are treated to a short intermission where Popeye's theme song is played while his face appears on the screen, blowing his signature \"toot, toot\" on his pipe. Players are then returned to the first stage again with increased difficulty. The Sea Hag now send bouncing skulls at Popeye, which are more difficult to punch. They will also fall down from an above level and knock him on the head if he is walking directly below.[CR]Ports[CR]Popeye was ported to several popular home consoles in subsequent years including the Atari 2600 and 5200, Intellivision, Colecovision, Odyssey2, and eventually came full circle releasing on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Ports to computer systems included the Texas Instruments TI-99, Atari XL, and Commodore 64. A mobile phone version was also released in 2008.[CR]",

You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely.[CR]   The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a \"plot\" than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between \"stages\" - the whole game play is continuous).",

Multicolored discs alongside the pyramid allow for a quick getaway, but disappear once used.[CR]Arcade Cabinet[CR]The game designers wanted to add the sound of Q*Bert hitting the ground after falling off of the pyramid, so a pinball \"knocker\" (the solenoid that alerts the player that they've won a free game) was incorporated into the cabinet.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The most common foe Q*Bert will encounter is Coily the snake, who hops down the pyramid structure. Once he reaches the bottom, he \"uncoils\" and chases after Q*Bert until he finishes the level or is killed. Red balls also bounce down the pyramid structure that Q*Bert must avoid. Slick and Sam are two more enemies that run around the structure changing the colors of the pyramid back to their original colors, slowing Q*Bert's progress. Unlike the other enemies in the game, Q*Bert can get rid of Slick and Sam by jumping on them.[CR]Other Versions[CR]Faster Harder More Challenging Q*Bert was to be the tougher successor to the original game.

Every time the player creates a closed space, they are awarded points and the space becomes solid so the QIX can no longer pass through it. Other enemies besides the QIX exist in the form of Sparx. The Sparx moves on the lines that the player draws and can defeat the player in the same way as the QIX.QIX was originally released in arcades in 1981 but Taito ported the game to a large variety of consoles such as the Atari 5200, Atari 400/800, Apple II, Commodore 64, DOS, Amiga (with new graphics), Apple IIGS, NES, and Atari Lynx. Nintendo also developed a Game Boy version that featured Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach.[CR]",

Other than dodging enemy vehicles, your primary concern is your jet's fuel level, which slowly depletes over time, and can be replenished by flying over fuel pads found throughout the environment, however shooting a fuel tank will also boost your score by several points, making whether or not to fuel up or go for the points somewhat of a strategic decision. Inexplicably, the plane will also explode if it flies over land. While River Raid features the forced movement common in scrolling shooters, you can affect the speed of the scroll with your jet by pressing either up or down on the control stick.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]River Raid was the first video game in history to be listed by the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, cited for \"its intent to compromise the minds of children by forcing a paramilitaristic [sic] education upon them, and the playing of which caused cramps, anger, headaches and aggressiveness\".

Although the game is fairly simple, the variety of enemies and strategies is notable. Current popular games, such as Geometry Wars, Everyday Shooter, and Super Stardust HD, all borrow their basic gameplay elements from Robotron.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]ControlsRobotron: 2084 is a top-down eight-way directional shooter, meaning that two separate control sticks are used. The left stick controls the movement of the character, while the right stick controls the direction of the shooting. While this is a style of gameplay fairly common in more recent shooter games, this was not the case the time of the game's creation.ObjectEnemies appear in \"waves,\" which function as the game's stages. The object of each wave is to destroy all of the enemies on the screen. However, each level also has a certain number of civilians. Saving civilians, while not necessary to advance to the next wave, will greatly increase the number of points the player can acquire. In the vein of most arcade games, the object of the game is to obtain as many points as possible.There is a fairly large variety of enemies within the game. The first type merely advance toward the player, but those in the later levels have more complex attacks which are difficult to avoid. The speed of the game also increases the longer the player is in the wave. The speed does reset if the player loses a life, however. The game resets after 255 waves back to wave 1.Every 5 waves, the player encounters a screen filled with a greatly increased number of humans to save. It is in these waves that the greatest number of points can be acquired. The human civiilans are hunted down in the game by the 'hulk' enemy. However, a glitch in the original programming means that these 'hulks' will all gravitate toward a single civilian, largely ignoring all the others. If this single human can be kept alive, then it is possilbe to collect a much greater number of the others, and achieve a dramatically increased score in the process. This feature was essentially a bug in the game, but ultimately gave rise to a key tactic in playing the game.[CR]",

If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.",

Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that Slime is a good game. It isn't. It doesn't live up to the standards of a good home video game, let alone a computer game. The primary object of Slime is to build a barrier of wedgeshaped (triangular) blocks to block the way of slime which is falling from the sky. And, of course, the slime is being dropped by killer aliens. The secondary objective is to deflect the slime into one of two giant vacuum tubes that are located at the edges of the screen. This gives you bonus points and also keeps the ocean from rising which is good.[CR]You are given a large ship which fires the triangular blocks that deflect the slime. The blocks can be destroyed by lightning storms, rampaging UFOs and fireballs. The maximum number of wedges available to the player is 20. If all 20 blocks are on the screen, you must position your target exactly on top of a block you want to eliminate - then press the red button and the wedge will disappear. This maneuver will give you an extra wedge which you can place anywhere above the ocean level. There are also UFOs that carry giant plugs with which they try to plug up your vacuum tubes. If they succeed, you have to wait for a chopper to come and take the plug out.[CR]The game has some nice features like very sharp graphics and, more importantly, total control over game variations. What this means is that you get to select the number of points you must earn before you are awarded a bonus ship, how high the ocean level is to begin with and the number of ships you want to use.[CR]Regrettably, the game's deficiencies outweigh the good points by far. The sound effects are probably the worst ever heard on any computer game. The controls are what the company (Synapse) refers to as \"sensitive\" but, in any other dictionary, they would be defined as unwieldy and terribly jumpy. The ship from which you fire moves absolutely randomly, thus making you a pawn to the whims of fortune, regardless of how well you play. And, last but not least, the fireballs destroy everything in their path. Thus all that wonderful control comes to nothing.[CR]Instead of blocking the slime as it falls from the sky, position your target right below the dropping slime. As soon as the slime touches the mark, fire a block.[CR][Electronic Fun - Vol. 1, No. 5 March,1983][CR]",

There is even a hopeless option where you attempt to challenge the computer alone. Include the possibilities of other variables such as different time limits and difficulty levels and you will soon decide the only thing left out of this game is a British announcer.[CR]But despite the countless alternatives, there are only two of any competitive consequence. First you can watch the computer play itself to a draw, or you can remove the computer from all competition and stick to human opponents. Invite the computer to play against you (he is totally merciless) or be on your team (he is an insufferable showoff) and you immediately become the weakest player on the field. Your team is actually better off without you.[CR]Another problem with the game becomes apparent when you want to gain control of a player. Pushing the fire button will activate the member of your team closest to the ball and he will stop moving and proudly display the number of your joystick port. This means that just as you need the player most he stands still, if only for a fraction of a second. Or say the player you really need to activate is the goalie. If he is not the nearest to the ball, forget it. By the time he has earned that distinction the opponent has probably scored.[CR]Your best chance of enjoying the game is to find some friends of equal talent and go for it. You can play until your thumbs turn stiff and your wrists freeze up but you'll never be able to compete in the computer's league.[CR]Never pass the ball across the front of your own goal.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game\u2019s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) versionGameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player\u2019s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their \u201cinvasion.\u201d As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or \u201cbunkers\u201d near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a \u201cmystery ship\u201d will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.[CR]Development[CR]While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinetDue to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game\u2019s original title, Space Monsters.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins\u2014and subsequent production increase\u2014in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 versionThe 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first \"killer app\" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as \"the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time.\" Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the \"Top 10 Most Influential Games\" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of \"The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time,\" stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which \"were attempts to simulate already-existing things,\" Space Invaders was \"the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else.\" In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a \u201chigh score,\u201d and was the first to save the player\u2019s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari\u2019s Asteroids, Williams\u2019 Defender, and Namco\u2019s Galaxian series.It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a \"seminal arcade classic\", IGN listed it as the number eight \"classic shoot 'em up\". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry.Remakes and sequelsSpace Invaders '95, one of many sequelsRecent ports and remakes include Space Invaders Anniversary, released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and including nine variants of the core game. Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders were featured in the arcade compilation Taito Legends (released in 2005), and Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders DX were featured in Taito Legends 2 (released in 2006). A remake of the game called Space Invaders Extreme was released for the PSP and Nintendo DS in 2008 and on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009. A second remake, Space Invaders Infinity Gene, was released in 2009 on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS devices. [CR]",

IDSI games don't always have nail-biting play-action, but they seldom fail to present a new and novel arcading experience.[CR]Speedway Blast preserved IDSI's reputation intact. The player wields a joystick to steer a racing car through a macro-maze composed of the streets of a small city. Driving the vehicle is a snap, and it shouldn't take most arcaders too long to learn how to execute hairpin turns even at top speeds.[CR]It's a good thing the racer is highly maneuverable, since it has to be just about everywhere at once to battle the pothole monsters that are rapidly chewing up the asphalt. A secondary display helps the gamer find the quarry, which \"hatch\" out of eggs that can be found at most intersections when the game begins. The player scoops up as many of these eggs as possible - and then uses a hood-mounted gun to fill in the holes and dispatch the monsters which dug them. When all the streets are free of both monsters and potholes, the game kicks up to the next difficulty level and resumes.[CR]The graphics in Speedway Blast are about the best ever seen on an IDSI game.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spy Hunter is a vehicle-based, vertical scrolling shooter, by legendary game designer George Gomez. The player controls an armored sports car with machine guns, and must destroy enemy cars, helicopters, and boats while protecting civilian vehicles. The track is endless with both street sections, and occasional waterways, where the vehicle switches to an armed boat.The game was well-received and spawned numerous ports, a pinball machine, an unsuccessful arcade sequel (which Gomez took no part in), and reboots.Gameplay[CR]Boat Stage, oil slick is set aflameThe player navigates a series of roads with civilian traffic, enemy cars, and road hazards for the player to either shoot or avoid. Scoring is accomplished by driving on the road (or water as a boat), and destroying enemy vehicles. There is a \"High-Low\" shifter to drive faster, which increases scoring and danger. Destroying a civilian pauses the score counter. After a short period of time, where a player may die unlimited times, the player has a finite number of lives. Additional lives may be earned though scoring.The vehicle has unlimited ammo for machine gun fire, and may pick up one of three additional weapons during gameplay, by entering the red \"Weapons Van\". The Weapons Van appears occasionally, and may be called upon in regular intervals. The player must careful line up behind the van, and accelerate into it while driving. Only one special weapon can be held at a time, and each of the three have a limited number of uses. Furthermore, losing a life also causes any special weapons to disappear.Special weapons consist of:Oil Slick - Leaves a slippery trail behind the vehicle, causing enemies to lose traction and crash. Oil slick is set aflame on water sections, and causes enemy boats to burn up.Missiles - Fires a rocket at enemy helicopters. This is the only way to destroy a helicopter.Smoke Screen - Leaves a trail of smoke behind, making it easy to escape from pursuing enemies.Music[CR]The game uses Henri Mancini's Peter Gunn theme as its soundtrack. Originally, it was to be the James Bond theme (which was Gomez' inspiration for the game), but licensing difficulties prevented the use.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doug Neubauer, one of the designers of a new Input/Output system which allowed for dynamic sound channels, created a game demo for the Atari 8-Bit computer, to demonstrate the new device. As Spacewar! before, the demo spawned a full standalone game: Star Raiders.Doug based the game on the text and primitive graphics based Star Trek games, where players would warp to a sector of space, eliminate enemies there, and warp to a new sector, defending starbases from attack and keeping an eye on your fuel. Star Raiders iterated upon this formula with action game trappings, adding 3D, real-time combat to Star Trek's strategic map-based view.Neubauer states that it was the first game to use 3-D algorithms which computed positions on all three axes. He explains why explosions in the game tend to slow it down: it took a lot of processing power then to guess the trajectory of the little particles that floated away from the destroyed target. In addition, he states:Today, of course, it's trivial, but back then it was state of the art. The game code is built up of modules: movement, control, collision detection, audio, photon firing, Zylon brain and console monitor. Special modules for galactic charts (and enemy strategy on charts) were included, along with a module for the long-range scanner.Atari 5200 OverlayThe game's success would prove to be a driving force behind Atari 8-bit sales, leading to contemporary ports to then-current Atari consoles. Due to the complexity of controls and gameplay, the Atari Touchpad controller was included in the 2600 release, with an overlay for Star Raiders - which would remain the sole game specifically designed for the controller. The Atari 5200's standard controller includes a keypad, so an overlay was supplied. Though keypads and overlays brought the gameplay closer to the Atari 8-Bit original, the game was simplified in various ways for both console releases.Solaris, also developed by Neubauaer, is a direct sequel, as is Star Raiders II, which Neubauaer was not involved in.Star Raiders' success would similarly lead to the first-person spaceflight combat genre's popularity, inspiring the seminal Elite, which in turn spawned games such as Wing Commander.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main interface Gameplay begins by choosing one of four difficulty levels. Higher difficulty results in more frequent, and more dangerous enemies. The objective is to obtain the highest game ranking, \"Star Commander Class 1\". The lowest possible ranking is \"Galactic Cook Class 5\". Rank is determined via a number of factors including energy used, damage taken, enemies killed, and more.Star Raiders features a complex series of options for controlling the ship, engaging in combat, and managing energy. The screen is divided into two parts: The majority of the screen is a 3D real-time combat field. Centered is a crosshair which indicates weapon trajectory, and view orientation. Switching from fore to aft view changes the crosshair to a dash to indicate a rear-facing perspective.A heads-up display on the lower right includes targeting data: proximity, and lock-on assistance.The lower portion of the screen features a display including:V: The ship's current velocityK: Enemy killsE: Energy units remaining out of 9999 possibleT / C: Tracking or Attack computer status\u0398 (theta): Horizontal coordinate with respect to current targeted enemy\u03a6 (phi): Vertical coordinate with respect to current targeted enemyR: Absolute distance to target (negative is behind ship)In addition to the on-screen display, a variety of control options are available to the player using keyboard input (Original Atari 8-Bit version), the included touchpad controller (Atari 2600) or the Atari 5200 controller. The Atari 8-Bit version has the most complete set of controls, while the console versions are simplified in various ways.Selecting a number between 0 and 9 sets the speed of the shipA/F Sets the current view to aft or fore, as indicated by the shape of the crosshair. Controls reverse for aft viewC/M Toggles the computer between Attack Control (the current status is indicated on the heads-up display) or manual targetingG Brings up the Galactic ChartH Engages HyperwarpL Engages the Long Range Sector ScanS Engages shieldsT Engages Tracking ModeP Pauses the gameThe Galactic ChartThe Galactic ChartThe Galactic Chart is a strategic map representing all sectors (individual grid cells) in the galaxy, and is where the player assesses threats on star bases, determines the direction and cost of hyperwarp jumps, and can review the Star Date and damage to Star Cruiser 7.EnemiesA number of dashes in a sector represents the number of Zylon enemies in that sector, from 1 to 4. A sector with a single dash may have 1 or 2 enemies. Speed is inversely proportional to the number of enemies, so thinning an enemy fleet also increases the speed of that enemy fleet, adding strategic decision making to engagement. The Targets indicator displays the number of targets in the sector that the cursor is currently hovering over.StarbasesThe star burst symbols represent stationary star bases, where the player repairs and refueles. Should all of them be destroyed, the game is lost, but every one lost results in a major reduction score, thereby reducing the player's final rank at the conclusion of the game.If a star base is surrounded, time is counting down before the Zylon fleet will destroy it. Every 50 time units that pass mean Zylons may move, and before too many more, should a base be surrounded, it will be destroyed. Should two bases be surrounded, only one will be the target, although it's up to the player to figure out which one is the intended target.HyperwarpA cursor, which looks like a photon bolt at long distance, helps the player plan where the ship is going to move on the Galactic Chart. As the player moves the cursor, the Warp Energy indicator will increase, showing the fuel drain of a given jump, from the sector the player is currently in to the target sector. After a certain amount, the energy drain jumps up dramatically. Whether or not this is planned, should the ship's course deviate too much away from the ship's start position, this fuel penalty will occur.Damage ControlThe letters following 'DC' represent the different functions which are vulnerable to damage. The letters turn yellow when a system is damaged, and pink when destroyed:P: Photons. Damage to this system means that one of the two photon torpedo emitters are down.E: Engines. Engines are a vital system when pursuing evasive targets, and when maneuvering to dock with a star base. Hyperspace engines cannot be damaged and are independent of the vulnerable Engine systems. Damage to the engines means that velocity is substandard, and also varies wildly from second to second, creating a violent stop-start effect past a certain velocity. Low velocities are relatively predictable, but high ones can often make the player overshoot the target during star base docking and pursuit maneuvers.S: Shields. If the shields are off, any hit by Zylon fire or asteroids instantly obliterate the ship. While on, shields lose energy when struck, and in higher difficulty levels, this hit usually results in damage or destruction of a subsystem. Should shields be damaged, they flash on and off at a random rate. While on, they provide protection like normal shields. While off, they leave the craft vulnerable, but they still cost energy to maintain. Destroyed shields leave the ship completely vulnerable, but still cost to leave them activated.C: Attack Computer. The attack computer is a power-draining system which includes target tracking, crosshair placement, and guided photon attacks during lock-ons. Damage to this subsystem removes the attack computer from the screen, although it still drains energy until turned off. Destruction of the system results in a frozen range finder, necessitating use of the long range sector scan for target tracking, should the enemy not be aggressive.L: Long Range Sector Scan. The sector scan helps the player locate all enemies in the sector, even when the game limits combat to two opponents at a time. Although difficult, combat kills can be achieved through this screen. Asteroids also show up on the sector scan. Damage to the sector scan results in a double image. Destruction of the system results in complete loss of functionality.R: Sub-space Radio. This is the system that keeps track of enemy movement, and informs the player of Zylons' star base surrounding and destruction. Should the radio be damaged, players will not reliably receive messages that a star base is surrounded or destroyed. In addition, the Galactic Chart is frozen in the last enemy/star base layout the player saw. The cursor still functions, but the only way a player can tell how many targets are in a given sector is with the target indicator at the bottom of the galactic chart screen.Long Range Sector ScanLong Range Scan The Long Range Sector Scan screen is a subset of the main screen, displaying the contents of the current sector. The player can pilot the craft, aim and fire photon torpedoes (forward only), and accelerate into hyperspace, though less quickly than from the Galactic Chart.Any asteroids, photon torpedoes, debris, Zylons, star bases, or refuel-and-repair craft in the sector are displayed as dark dashes. They will be in a sphere around the spaceship (represented in the center of the screen, with fore pointing up, and aft pointing down). Due to the similarity of all objects, the player must deduce the identity of an object based on movement pattern.Star Base Docking and DestructionDocking procedure Docking with a star base restores a ship's energy count to a full 9999, and repairs all damage. Every time a player docks, the score drops by a small amount, which in turn affects the final player ranking.The player must navigate the saucer-like star base within the cross hairs, and the attack computer should has the base in full lock. Proper distance and orientation are necessary to activate the star base docking procedure. When at the proper distance, a message will come up telling the player that the procedure has begun. Moving the ship aborts the sequence. Once docked, the ship is instantly repaired and refueled, and can now leave the sector.If a player is in a star base sector when it is destroyed, Zylons will instantly be in the sector. A player can destroy a star base with torpedoes.Hyperwarp JumpIn Hyperwarp Hyperwarp moves the player from one sector to another quickly, and costs fuel. Engaging hyperwarp is possible within the Galactic Map, the Long Range Sensor Scan, or on the main combat screen. While in hyperwarp, photon torpedoes no longer function, and at higher velocities, enemy photons will not be able to harm the player, making it a useful tactic to disengage from combat. The faster the ship is moving, the more quickly hyperwarp engages. In the center of the screen a small cross symbol will appear. The closer to the center this cross is, the closer to the center of the reference point on the Galactic Chart the ship will go.Hyperspace engines will always work given enough fuel. The galactic chart allows the player to change the point of reference that the center of the screen represents.When leaving hyperspace, the player can fire photons again.[CR]Cultural Notes[CR]Star Raiders was released during a revival of science fiction which followed the first Star Wars film. It also seemed strongly influenced by the original Star Trek series, which was still present in the public mindset. Faster than light travel was referred to as hyperwarp, warp being a staple term in Star Trek's faster than light travel, and the weapons both players and Zylons use are photons, referred to sometimes as photon torpedoes, one of the main weapons in the Star Trek franchise. It may also be relevant to note that early games that featured Star Trek were often of similar design, where the player commands a Federation starship, warping from sector to sector to defend star bases from marauding enemies, keeping an eye on the fuel gauge and taking damage to ship subsystems.Another subtle Star Trek reference seems to have been in the design of the Zylon cruiser. As it draws close, one notices a bump between the two curved arches that point downward from the ship's middle. This close-up view could be seen to look like the head-on view of the classic Klingon Cruiser design.References don't seem to stop at Star Trek, though. Star Wars was referenced by the Zylon fighter, which closely resembled the TIE-fighters used by the Galactic Empire.  [CR]",

The game was based on two different scenarios.  In the first sequence you fought through swarms of Tie-fighters and worked to lower the force field surrounding the Death Star.  As you battled the force field would lower giving you a few moments to scramble through the opening to begin sequence two.  In sequence two, you are faced with more Tie-fighters and the \"under construction\" Death Star itself.  During the second sequence, the Death Star is constantly having more portions put together to complete its construction and thus making the powerful world destroying super laser operational.  The game charges you with keeping Tie-fighters at bay while successfully chipping away at the outer layers of the Death Star, exposing the laser.  Once you destroy the laser, and Death Star, you complete the level and basically replay the game at higher difficulty.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]   [CR]The Atari 2600 version of the game uses the familiar joystick that controls the Falcon in all directions.

As with most sequels, Stargate didn't change the game formula that helped make the original game a hit.  Instead Stargate expanded on the formula...[CR]Stargate added a number of new features to the Defender formula including new enemies, new abilities, and of course stargates!  Stargates allow players to instantly warp from one area of the level to another, which can be very handy if used right.  Stargates can also be used to warp forward levels if certain amounts of humanoids are carried into them.  The ability to score bonus points for carrying multiple humanoids is also a new feature first introduced in this game.[CR]Other new abilities include the Inviso power, which is basically a super cloaking device.  Using Inviso makes your ship invisible and allows it to pass through all enemies and their shots.  However you can still shoot while \"Inviso\", so make the most your Inviso time.  Stargate also includes the ability to enter Hyperspace.  Entering Hyperspace is just as dangerous as it was in defender, and while it can save your life in an emergency it can also blow you to smithereens.  Use the Hyperspace option sparingly!  [CR]Stargate is unique among Atari 8-bit games as it uses the original arcade title screen, including all the arcade colors, fonts, and options.  Of course all of this wasn't by coincidence, programmer Steve Baker had an original Stargate arcade machine in his house so he could perfect the 8-bit version.  According to Steve when he was done you could stand back 10 feet from the screens and not be able to tell the difference.[CR]While Stargate may have beautiful graphics and an arcade accurate title screen, the only known version has massive slowdown problems.  When too many enemies get on the screen at once (which is often) the gameplay becomes extremely choppy.  According to Steve this is because Stargate used all the Atari 8-bit's processor due to the variety of graphical techniques used (Hi-Res, Bitmap, and Player Graphics). [CR]Although Stargate never achieved the same level of success as its predecessor, it shows that even a great game like Defender has room for improvements.   It is unknown why the Atari 8-bit port was unreleased, but the 5200 version also met a similar fate.  I guess the collapsing market just couldn't wait for quality arcade ports to be released.[CR]https://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/stargate/stargate.htm[CR]",

Your job is to sink as much enemy shipping as possible while keeping your sub intact. This is no fast-paced shoot-em-up. You're really in a sub with all of its problems and limitations-batteries that need recharging, an air supply that needs to be replenished by surfacing, and the sub's very slow speed when you're submerged.[CR]There are three different screen displays-all flanked by a cluster of instruments and gauges that tell you depth, remaining air supply, torpedoes and condition of various parts of the sub. The three displays show a map that pinpoints your own location and where the enemy convoys are, sonar and hydrophone displays, and a periscope view which works only when you're at 45 feet of depth or less.[CR]You're surrounded by danger. If the destroyers' depth charges don't damage you, it's possible to scrape or get stuck on the bottom, damaging your propellers and engines; you can run out of air or battery charge; or your hull can crack from diving too deep.[CR]The joystick controls diving and surfacing as well as compass heading. The button fires torpedoes, but you can't shoot more than two at any one time, since it takes time to reload the torpedo tubes. Also, you can't fire unless your depth is just right (about 35 feet or higher). The sub responds to controls with agonizing slowness.[CR]Yet the rewards are enormous. Whenever you hit an enemy ship, you want to jump up and cheer. There are plenty of misses, too, and when you're within torpedo range, you're usually getting smeared by a barrage of depth charges.[CR]This is a long game-it can easily take a half-hour or more to either sink all the enemy ships or get yourself sunk. Time is eaten up by repairs and recharging the batteries on the surface. You have to watch your sonar bottom display very carefully-along with a dozen or so other displays and gauges. The realism level of this game is incredible, and there are no magic escape hatches. The graphics are super, and the game has a lot of staying (and frustration) power. Playing strategy? There isn't one; just have patience while those repairs are being made.[CR][Electronic Fun - Vol. 1, No. 3 Jan 1983][CR]",

The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. [CR]This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. [CR]The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.",

To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel.

The differences are:[CR]1. Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge.[CR]2. The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics.[CR]3. There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3.[CR]4. Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2.[CR]5. A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits.[CR]6. Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots.[CR]7.

                "plot": "If you were like me, the first thing you did after seeing The Last Starfighter in theaters was run to your local arcade and see if they had that really cool game that Alex was playing throughout the movie.  Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Atari never made such a game.  The one you see in the movie is all special effects, as such a game would have been impossible to make back in 1984.  Atari was planning on releasing a TLSF arcade machine which would have been similar to Star Wars, but it never got far beyond the Alpha stage (only one prototype was made, but it's long gone).  However Atari also planned to release a home version of TLSF for the Atari 5200, 400/800, and 2600.  While the 2600 version of TLSF was eventually changed and released as Solaris, the 5200 and 400/800 versions were never released.  [CR]Unfortunately the home version was nothing like the planned arcade game, but rather a shooting/strategy game similar to Star Raiders.  The reason for this is simple, this game originally started out as a totally separate game called Orbiter.  It wasn't until Orbiter was about 35% done that Atari decided that it would make a perfect candidate to be reprogrammed into The Last Starfighter (only preserving a small amount of the original code).  Finally in 1985, Atari decided to finally release The Last Starfighter as Star Raiders II on disk for the Atari XL and eventually on cartridge for the XE.  While Star Raiders II is basically the same game as TLSF, some changes were made to make it blend better with the Star Raiders style (along with removing all the Last Starfighter references). [CR]\"Greetings Starfighter. You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan armada.\"[CR]It's not just a tag line, it's also the instructions!  Yes, you've been recruited to help the Star League destroy Xur and his forces once and for all.  To accomplish this, you'll have to travel to the Procyon system and destroy the Ko-Dan in their own galaxy.  However, while you're off playing cowboy in a distant galaxy, the Ko-Dan armada are planning their own attack on your home system of Celos IV.  So not only must you defeat the whole Ko-Dan empire single handed, you must also defend your galaxy at the same time.  Accomplishing both tasks at once is all about strategy, sharp shooting, and a little luck. [CR] \"One Gunstar?  Against the whole armada?  It'll be a slaughter!\"[CR]Thankfully this isn't just any old Gunstar, its been upgraded and modified with the latest weapons and armor.  Not only is your Gunstar a weapons powerhouse, but it can take several hits before being destroyed.  Your Gunstar comes equipped with lasers, Ion Cannons, and Surface Star Bursts (SSB); each of these weapons is used against a specific type of enemy.  Lasers are used against Ko-Dan Deckfighters, Ion Cannons are used against Ko-Dan Destroyers and Command Ships, and SSB are used to destroy Ko-Dan cities on the planets.  The weapons that are currently activated are shown by three lights in the lower left corner (top: lasers, middle: Ion Cannons, bottom: SSB).  You can switch between these different weapons by pressing the Option or Select button.  While your lasers and Ion Cannons have unlimited ammunition, you only have a limited amount of Surface Star Bursts which are shown in a gauge next to the weapon lights.  Unfortunately unlike the movie, there's no \"Death Blossom\" option to single handedly wipe out the entire armada.  Instead you need to use strategy to outwit the hordes of Ko-Dan ships. [CR]Your Gunstar also comes equipped with a computer readout (at the top of the screen), which will tell you when you have a systems malfunction.   If your Scanners are out, you won't see a map of the planet surface when you bomb Ko-Dan cities.  If your Communications system is out, the galaxy map won't be updated.  If your Weapons system goes out, you won't be able to shoot one or more of your weapons until you get them fixed.  To fix your systems, simply plot a course for the center of the sun and wait a few seconds (be sure not to melt though).  Also, make sure to give your lasers a rest every now and then or they'll overheat and fire very slowly until they cool down.[CR]\"Terrific. I'm about to get killed a million miles from nowhere with a gung-ho iguana who tells me to relax.\"[CR]By pressing the spacebar you can bring up the Galaxy Map.  The Galaxy Map show you where all the Ko-Dan squadrons are currently located (and the number of fighters in that squadron), where your ship is currently parked, and stats about each planet.  Using the map you can plot a course anywhere in the galaxy by making a line between your ship and your target destination.  Once the course has been plotted you can activate your warp engines by pressing the fire button and your ship will move to the new location.  You can also use the map to check up on your planets.  By highlighting each planet it will show if any enemies are currently in orbit attacking the cities.  You can also plot a course to the sun to recharge your energy and repair systems, but be careful not to stay in the sun too long or you'll melt! [CR]Once you've engaged a Ko-Dan squadron your weapons system will arm and you'll have access to your lasers and Ion Cannons.  Use your lasers to take out the red Deckfighters by leading them ever so slightly and then quickly cutting back (it takes some practice).  Once you've wiped out all the Deckfighters your targeting system will switch to Ion Cannon mode and you'll encounter up to three Destroyers.  When taking out the Destroyers you'll need to carefully aim your Ion Cannons since they're not nearly as fast as your lasers.[CR]\"I've always wanted to fight a desperate battle against incredible odds.\"[CR]Once you think you've got your system under control, you can attempt to go take out a few Ko-Dan bases in their own territory.  To get to the Procyon System, bring up your map screen and target the tiny cluster of planets in the upper left hand corner.  Be aware that you're in enemy territory now, so you'll be under constant attack.  To take out the bases, warp to one of the three Ko-Dan planets and start destroying the tiny little cities with your SSB.  You can use the scanner to help locate the cities on the planet surface, and to help you target them more efficiently.  While bombing the Ko-Dan planets it's best to ignore the endless waves of Deckfighters that attack you, as they're only purpose is to distract you.  Take out a few cities and then warp back to the safety of your own solar system. [CR]\"I'll have everything figured out by the time we reach the Frontier\"[CR]Every now and then you'll receive a warning that the enemy is attacking the Frontier.  If you leave one of these ships alone too long they'll sneak through the Frontier and start attacking your planets.  Stopping them at the Frontier is an easy way to take out a whole squadron without all the work.  When you see a Frontier Cutter, bring up the Galaxy Map and look for an enemy squadron on the edge of the solar system.  Warp to the enemy's location and you'll see what appears to be a little Command Ship attempting to cut a hole through the Frontier.  A single Ion Cannon shot will take out this little nuisance, and then you can be on your way.  [CR]\"Death is a primitive concept; I prefer to think of them as battling evil - in another dimension!\"[CR]As in the movie, you are the Star League's last hope.  Since it's just you against the armada you only have one life to save the galaxy, make it count!  Make sure that you don't take any chances, and recharge in the sun whenever you think necessary.  Although the game will move along while your recharging, it takes several minutes for squadrons to destroy planets so you usually have time to recharge and attack.  Keeping your systems in working order is vital to surviving the waves of Ko-Dan fighters, losing a planet because you let your Communications system break down won't cut it in the Star League. [CR]\"May the luck of the Seven Pillars of Gulu be with you at all times.\"[CR]While the arcade game may never have made it to fruition, the home version of The Last Starfighter is very impressive.  Although TLSF is clearly in the same vein as Star Raiders, it is different enough to stand on its own legs without being called an outright clone.  It's a shame that TLSF never was released in this form, because it makes an impressive adaptation of the movie and one heck of a game.  Although Star Raiders II is mostly the same, I think it's the Last Starfighter theme that makes this game so special, and without it this title falls a little flat.  The introduction alone makes this version superior and worth the price of admission. [CR]https://www.atariprotos.com/8bit/software/tlsf/tlsf.htm[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]110m HurdlesTrack & Field is an Olympic themed arcade game developed and published by Konami. It is known as Hyper Olympic in Japan.It has been ported to over nine different platforms including the NES, as well as Xbox Live Arcade, since its original release.Track & Field introduced a button-mashing style of gameplay in which the player must press a button as fast as possible, and their in-game character interacts with the environment accordingly. This style of gameplay is still used today by many popular titles. The arcade release accommodated up to four players at once. The NES version (arguably the most popular) was designed for only two players. Track & Field has received graphical and sound updates, leaderboards, online play, and additional events since its initial release in 1983. The Atari 2600 version included a specialized controller, mimicking the arcade input.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Long JumpIn the arcade version of Track & Field, players had two \"run\" buttons and one \"action\" button. The run buttons were used to increase the speed of the character on-screen, while the action button was used to do things like initiate a jump or adjust the angle of a javelin throw. The NES version (possibly due to hardware limitations) had only one run button.100 Meter Dash110 Meter HurdlesHammer ThrowHigh JumpJavelin ThrowLong JumpIn each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) ends the game. Events that were later added to Track & Field after the arcade release include: 100-meter freestyle, skeet shooting, vault, archery, triple jump, weight lifting, and pole vault.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade[CR]A slightly enhanced version of Track & Field was released for XBLA in 2007. It includes full Xbox Live support (ranked and player matches) and in-depth leaderboards.[CR]The Track & Field Legacy[CR]Archery was added after the original arcade release.Over the years, Konami released several games featuring gameplay from the same vein as the original:Konami '88 (1988) (Arcade)Track & Field II (1988) (NES)Track & Field (1992) (Game Boy)International Track & Field (1996) (PS)Hyper Athlete (1996) (Arcade)Nagano Winter Olympics '98 (1998) (N64, PS)International Track & Field 2000 (1999) (N64, PS, GBC)ESPN International Track & Field (2000) (DC, PS2, GBC)Track and Field (2007) (Xbox Live Arcade)New International Track & Field (2008) (NDS)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The 1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track & Field Challenge was the largest video game tournament in history, with over a million contestants, including 800,000 in the US and 200,000 in Japan.
