The Beasts, led by a being known as Chief Zog, have risen up against the humans, led by Queen Azarel. In desperation, Queen Azarel summons the realm's wizards for help.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Resource-management and base/unit building is a major part of gameplay, but the real depth lies in mastering the power of the collectible Wizard units. Serving as the game's version of the typical RTS hero unit, each Wizard has their own unique power, ranging from building reinforcement to the ability to turn other units into chickens. Taking a cue from Pokemon, Wizards can be traded from game to game, but instead of using a Game Link cable Warlocked uses the Game Boy Color's infrared sensor.[CR]In the game's main story mode, players can play as either the Humans or the Beasts, each with their own set of missions. Using a Game Link cable two players can engage in a skirmish mode.[CR]The game also features two minigames - a version of Poker and a sliding puzzle.[CR]Sequel Cancellation[CR]A sequel, Wizards, was in development for the Game Boy Advance at Bits Studios, but was canceled for unknown reasons before development could be finished.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Codes[CR]Enter the codes on the \"Check Code'' screen to get the following options in the Cheat Menu:",

The third installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new hidden variations of normal tricks and the Revert, a ground trick that can be executed as soon as the player hits the ground from a quarter-pipe, allowing them to continue from a Vert combo chain), and online multiplayer for up to four players (PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions only). The Career Mode currency system from the predecessor is removed (unlocking levels now just require objective completion, while stat increase points and new decks are gained by picking up special pickups scattered throughout levels).",

Like the Nintendo 64 game, Perfect Dark for Game Boy Color follows the exploits of secret agent Joanna Dark. In this edition, Agent Dark must complete seven huge missions that involve weapon play as well as puzzle solving. These missions revolve around the destruction of illegal cyborg manufacturing facilities. The game features full motion video cutscenes that unfold the storyline for the gamer. The game itself doesn't utilize a first-person perspective for the action -- instead, Perfect Dark GBC features a pseudo-overhead viewpoint, much like what Konami did with Metal Gear: Ghost Babel and what Rebellion did with Mission: Impossible. However, at certain points in the game you'll be placed in a through-the-eyes perspective as well. This game also has a built-in rumble feature.Perfect Dark on the Game Boy Color was set in the year leading up to the start of the N64 game, covering her final test and graduation to full service as a Carrington Institute operative and her first mission. The game was played mostly from an isometric top-down perspective but included a variety of other game types such as a vertically scrolling driving section, a first-person sniping section and a number of different boss fight stages. The game encouraged stealth over action in keeping with the N64 game.The game made use of many of the features of the hardware. A two player deathmatch mode made use of the link cable, unlockable stickers could be printed using the Game Boy printer or traded with other players via the infra-red port and the cartridge had a built-in rumble feature. If used in conjunction with the N64 Transfer Pak, the game could be used to unlock four cheat modes in N64 Perfect Dark - All Weapons, Claoking Device, Hurricane Fists and R-Tracker.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Missile Command you control three missile turrets and protect six cities from incoming nuclear missiles. When you lose all of your cites, then it's game over, and the game doesn't end until you lose and the inhabitants of the cities are killed. The original arcade release had you using a trackball to move a cursor around the screen, with the press of one of three buttons you could fire a missle from the appropriate missile turret. Each missile turret has 10 missiles per level, however your missiles have a wide explosion range, letting you destroy multiple incoming missiles with one blast. The game has a set number of incoming missiles per level, and as you go up in level, the number of incoming missiles increases, therefore increasing the difficulty. The overall goal of the game, like many games from the 70's and 80's is to get the highest  High Score.[CR] Bugs & Glitches[CR]The original version has a bug that happens once you get to 810,000 points. You get awarded with 150 extra cities, making it possible to play the game for several more hours.Strategies[CR]After getting up to the 255th and 256th stages (known as the 0x stages) the scoring increases by 256 times, but the speed of the missiles also becomes accelerated. Expert players have been known to score over 1 million points, enabling some players to reach up to 2,800,000 points. The scoring system was primitive enough at the time where it would only show six-digits, so their 2,800,000 showed up as 800,000. After getting past the 256th stage, the game reverts back to the original speed from stage 1, but keeps your point total and your extra cities, making it possible to keep playing the game in a giant loop. [CR]Remakes[CR]Missile Command was originally released in  arcades in 1980 and ported to the  Atari 2600, from there it was made on the  Atari 5200 and the  Atari 8-bit, as well as other consoles. The game became so incredibly popular, that over the years it has been remade by various companies under different names, and sometimes even slightly different graphics. A few examples of these are  Commando Raid,  Lunar Command, and  Condition Red.[CR]",

The player can reach extremely high speeds and use quick reflexes to dodge oncoming racers and obstacles. The racer begins each of the three lap races with three lives, meaning that in contrast to the film crashing doesn't mean your race is over, but is more of a minor setback. Once the lives are all used up, however, the racer is disqualified. Alongside the home console (of which just the N64 version was published by Nintendo) and computer versions, a port for the Game Boy Color was released with entirely different tracks, but similar core gameplay. Of greater note is Star Wars: Racer Arcade (developed jointly by Sega AM5 [later renamed Sega Rosso] and Lucasarts), which put the public in the seat of Anakin Skywalker's Pod with a cockpit shaped control deck. Two levers were used to control the game, mirroring events in the film. There are only four tracks in the Arcade, many less than the other versions.",

Rather an a simulation, Blitz is an extremely exaggerated version of football, with humongous players that can run extremely fast and deliver hits that send players flying tens of yards. Since all of the players have nearly superhuman abilities, the downs are done on a 30-yard basis instead of 10 yards. Plays are very limited with the simplified interface, and all kicks in the game are done automatically.The traditional rules of football do not exist in Blitz, so as to not slow down play. Pass interference, roughing the passer, and late hits are completely normal. Players also celebrated quite loudly after making hard hits or scoring. These aspects would be limited later on in the blitz series as the NFL became more strict with its license.You can keep track of your stats in NFL Blitz using a name and code, much like a fighting game. Certain names let you unlock special characters, such as Raiden.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]At the match-up screen enter the following codes, with the digits corresponding to Start-B-A respectivelly, followed by the direction on the D-pad.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords to play as the designated teams:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords to play as the designated teams:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hide Cursor While Making Plays[CR]When you're on the play selection screen, you can hide the cursor so others can't see the play you choose.

The team for both the human and A.I. players can be chosen. There are also several options that can be changed in this mode.Tournament - In tournament mode the player chooses a team to play as. After a team has been chosen a group, either A, B, C, or D will be chosen and the player will play in a tournament against those teams.Playoff - Playoff mode plays much like the tournament mode, except the player does not choose a group to play against, all opposing teams are chosen by the game.League - League mode is like a career mode from other sports games. The player chooses a team and then proceeds to play through a season.Indoor - In the indoor mode the player chooses both the player and A.I. teams. This game mode is very similar to a regular exhibition match except the ball will bounce off of the walls and there are no out of bounds.[CR]Genesis/Mega Drive Version[CR]The mobile phone version was ported by EA and TecToy to Mega Drive (mostly as a built-in game) in Brazil under the name FIFA 2000 Gold Edition.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Level Passwords",

Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.[CR]Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.[CR]The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.[CR]The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.[CR]Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.",

Released only in Japan and later the US, it features a variety of different features that have gone on to become staples of the Harvest Moon franchise, such as multiple animals and horse racing.[CR]It differs from the previous handheld installments in that there are two playable characters, a boy and a girl.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pete[CR]Boy (Pete)[CR]Is invited by Mr. Heinz to help run the farm with the girl character following his successes in Flower Bud Village. Sara[CR]Girl (Sara)[CR]Takes over her fathers farm after travelling for many years. Has no experience in farming but is proficient with animal care.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The boy character from Harvest Moon 2 is approached by a man called Mr. Heinz who informs him of an opportunity to revive a small farm on an island. The farm was originally run by the girl character's father and has since been left in disuse. The girl has taken up ownership of the farm but is inexperienced, and so Mr. Heinz asks the boy to help her.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Duplicate Items, Easy Cash[CR]Go to the shipping screen. [CR]Choose an item (Press ''A'') that you have A LOT of. [CR]Move to the maximum # that you have for that item. [CR]Press ''B'' to cancel away. [CR]Choose an item (Press ''A'') you want a lot of, whether it be expensive of something you need for a job. [CR]Press Down once. This number should be many more than what you actually have, usually appears as one less than the total of the item you wanted to sell. [CR]Press ''A'' and sell that amount. [CR]Go back into the screen, and notice you have many more than you did. Repeat if desired. [CR]NOTE: This trick is many times more effective if there is a larger amount between items (55 and 1) [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Duplicate Items, Easy Cash[CR]Okay..first of all, you have to do enough part time work to get to this one. After doing a series of work, talk to the lady at the farmers union in the part time work corner. Keep rejecting the jobs she offers you, untill she tells you about catching the River King in 120 days. Select yes, then run back to your farm and call the farmers union. Tell them that you have completed the job! (note: you don't have to actually go out and catch him!) After that, the people will say stuff like you've really comepleted the job and send you the money right away! At 6:00 pm, you will be 72000 richer! That includes bonuses for completing it 120 days early of course. This really works!",

No more spooky camera angles, no more carrying a certain amount of items and no more scares. Don\u2019t be disappointed, though; Gaiden remains a superb actioner with a gripping storyline, plenty of recognisable characters and a brand new way of destroying zombies. When you meet said zombies, the game switches to first-person and shows them approaching. A power bar appears at the bottom of the screen and careful hits stop your foes and allow you to continue exploring. An underrated classic.",

Players can now play as either Mega Man X or Zero, each with their own set of levels and bosses. The game also includes two unlockable game modes: Extreme Mode (allowing players to fight all eight bosses and close the game's plot) and Boss Attack Mode (allowing players to fight all eight bosses from either this game or Mega Man Xtreme).[CR]The game is set in the year 21XX, between Mega Man X3 and Mega Man X4. When the memory and programming of Reploids in Laguz Island are being erased (in what is called the \"Erasure Incident\"), Maverick Hunters Mega Man X and Zero investigate only to learn that the \"DNA Souls\" of Reploids are being used by \"Soul Erasers\" (Berkana and Gareth) to resurrect old Mavericks. Now it's up to X and Zero (along with rookie Navigator Iris) to retrieve the DNA Souls, defeat the revived Mavericks, and foil the plans of the Soul Erasers.[CR]The game was later released as a Virtual Console title for the Nintendo 3DS (in Japan only) on December 25, 2013.[CR]",

These new powers could be used to progress through the games many worlds. Wario Land 3 used the same successful formula, and benefited from GBCs slightly better visuals.[CR]Each level housed treasure to collect, but in true adventure game fashion, some couldnt be reached without a bit of backtracking or clever use of Wario's newfound immortality. This unique execution of power-ups and exploration, two well-worn aspects of 2D games, helped make Wario Land 3 one of the best games on GBC. Add in some nice animation, fun music, and a not-totally-throwaway story and you've got a sequel worth of being called one of Game Boy's best.",
