Whether you started playing game before, during, or after the era of the little gray box that could, Nintendo's first Entertainment System provided joy, laughs, frustration, and straight up anger for millions of kids and adults alike. Even now, long-time players will bring the NES out, wade through the inevitable flashing screens and cartridges that won't start until they're blown in, and play their favorites for old times' sake.[CR]We'd wager that a lot of those favorites can be found here in this list of the 50 best games on the original Nintendo. There are names here that still live on today and others that have fallen by the wayside, but all of them are incredible experiences from a time when games were more about fun and challenge than big budgets and flashy graphics. These are the classics",

The game was clunky, every ball hit into the outfield was at least a double, and it just didn’t feel like the true American pastime. Once Tengen got involved with RBI Baseball, the game had changed forever; RBI was what we were looking for all along.[CR]RBI Baseball was the first ever sports game licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, and as such all of the players on the diamond were authentic MLB athletes (though the MLB itself did not lend a license, so the teams were differentiated by their cities and colors, no team names or logos allowed). The gameplay felt more like a real baseball game; the pitching was way more authentic, and the players’ stats actually represented their real abilities. Try hitting a Nolan Ryan fastball or throwing out Vince Coleman at second base. It was impossible in real life, and it was impossible here. We’d didn’t need any more reason to play ball.",

Trust us, Qix is worth a try.[CR]Your objective is to draw lines in a rectangle, claiming parts of the shape as your own as you create smaller shapes, until you inhabit a majority of the playing field. Meanwhile, a series of colored lines, called Qix, will travel through the rectangle, breaking your lines as you draw them and generally making things harder for you. You only have so many lives to complete your task, and one is lost every time the Qix touches a line. It sounds a whole lot more fun now that you know what’s happening, right?

Batman, thankfully, bucks that trend, delivering a solid platformer that some superhero fans still consider to be the best game of its kind on the NES.[CR]At first glance Batman seems like an ordinary action platformer; you’re jumping around, punching enemies, and gaining points. However, Batman has a trick up his sleeve that only Ryu Hayabusa shares; he can wall jump, adding more height to his jump for those hard-to-reach places. Today it sounds so ancillary, but back then it was a pretty big deal, and it definitely set Batman apart. This game had a lot going against it, but Batman still came out on top. He always does.",

That was the thought process during every single game of Duck Hunt, and what seems like such a simple game was an incredibly addicting experience.[CR]The use of the NES Zapper worked wonders for this game, for we have no idea how we would have taken those idiot ducks without it. That dog would have had his fill of laughing at our behinds, that’s for sure. The Zapper put the feel of hunting right into our hands, and even if it was just pixelated ducks, we felt like we could go out and bag the real thing... until the damn dog laughed at us again. Man, he’s a real turd.",

This is dodge ball without the bruises; it’s perfect![CR]The frantic 3-on-3 action of Super Dodge Ball, especially when playing against a friend, can lead to some great times even today.

StarTropics’ hero, Mike Jones, would visit towns and other areas searching for clues and battling enemies in the top-down perspective, while traveling the world to other locations on the world map.

We have no objection, because this new Rygar is quite awesome.[CR]The transition to a Metroidvania style game really set Rygar NES apart from its run-of-the-mill arcade counterpart, introducing an open-ended map, with areas that require items to access and permanent power-ups, giving it an action-RPG edge as well. Tecmo must have known that another action game wouldn’t have worked on a home console, because this Rygar is something we’ll never forget.",

It’s not Aerith getting a Masamune to the gut, but that didn’t make us any less upset.[CR]Even if that plot twist hadn’t happened, Double Dragon II exceeds its predecessor in every possible way. New moves in combat, a new and better control scheme, and the addition of two-player co-op allowed us to kick butt in new and exciting ways, this time with a friend. Double Dragon II pulled us in with a crazy story twist, but it offered enough fresh ideas to make exacting The Revenge worth it.",

This simplicity made Tecmo Super Bowl a household name; mention it to anyone and the first thing you’ll probably hear is READY, DOWN, HUTHUTHUTHUTHUTHUTHUT![CR]The simplistic art style and audio worked well together to create a minimalist interface that didn't get in the way of the game. The only time things ever really broke away into something more complicated was during the cutscenes, which showed the game's big plays with awesome pixel art, but those were so awesome that we don't think anyone minded the sudden change of direction.

Hayabusa is an adept ninja, flying across the screen and slicing his way through enemies with ease. We died a lot, we cursed a lot more, but we loved playing through Ninja Gaiden back in the good old days... well, as far through it as we could without going insane.",

Pro-Am, which set the bar for arcade racing way back in 1988.[CR]One of the first commercial NES successes for the development house called Rare, R.C. Pro-Am put us on a track with four radio-controlled slot cars and tasked us with placing in the top three to advance. We had to avoid oil slicks, puddles, and other obstacles, all while being wary of possible missile attacks from other cars. We still remember racing our way through each track, laughing with every victory and cursing with every defeat. Next time you boot up the most recent Mario Kart, remember R.C.

It’s a shame too, because this version had a two-player simultaneous mode that Nintendo’s version lacked, as well as sharper gameplay and better all-around presentation. The only thing the Nintendo version had over it was the musical ending with Mario and crew... and that doesn’t do a whole lot for us.

We disagree with MM3 being better, but we do agree that it’s still an awesome Mega Man game.[CR]The stages in MM3 do have a higher range of difficulty than the previous games; Snake Man’s stage in particular still gives us nightmares. We also love the soundtrack here, with Top Man, Shadow Man, and Snake Man’s themes being major highlights. Where we start doubting is the boss selection: There’s no way a doofus like Top Man, cool music and all, is superior to any of the robot masters in MM2.

Super Mario Bros. 2 changed so much about the classic Mario formula, and yet it still managed to be an unforgettable side-scroller on its own terms.[CR]Originally a very non-Mario game reskinned, the colorful world and gameplay were still inviting even though the world had changed. SMB2 had more engaging enemies and bosses, a killer soundtrack, and a twist ending that was unheard of at the time. Maybe it wasn't what players expected from a sequel, but everyone who played it got over that real fast.",
