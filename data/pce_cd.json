The North American version, known as the TurboGrafx-CD, went on sale in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16 (the North American version of the PC Engine). While it had little success in North America, the device boosted sales for the PC Engine in Japan. It helped the PC Engine outsell the NES for a while (up until the release of the SNES) and become the second best-selling console of the 16-bit era, behind the Super Famicom (which later planned its own PlayStation CD add-on) and ahead of the Sega Mega Drive (which later had its own CD-ROM add-on, the Sega CD).[CR]Developer:  Hudson Soft[CR]Manufacturer:  NEC[CR]CPU:  Hudson Soft HuC6280[CR]Memory:  64 kB[CR]Graphics:  HuC6260[CR]Sound:  6 Mini-Wavetable stereo audio channels[CR]Display:  565x242[CR]Media:  CD[CR]Max Controllers:  5 (Via Turbotap)",

                "plot": "1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game (with MOUSE support!) set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called gekokujou situation, when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his/her own character. Character creation is Ultima-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.[CR]The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and maneuvering the troops.",

The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...[CR]Like most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a \"hub\" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.",

The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. Two-player gameplay is also possible.[CR]Upon reaching the final square of a \"world\", the player has to face a \"boss enemy\" (usually a character from popular games by  Capcom, such as  Side Arms,  Forgotten Worlds, etc.). The boss offers the player a choice of several available topics for the decisive quiz. \"Defeating\" the boss leads the player into a new worlds with its own structure, etc.[CR]The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles).[CR]Hatena? no Daiboken is a follow-up to Capcom World, offering a few enhancements: multiple paths through some worlds, special squares that lead to new challenges (such as a quiz with only three possible answers), etc.",

                "plot": "Wisperad is a small universe that consists of only a few star systems. Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.[CR]A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.[CR]Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.[CR]The bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercraft. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.[CR]The Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks, whereas the TurboGrafx CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.",

The game is set during the Age of Discovery in the 15th century.[CR]There is a strict time limit of five years to discover mysterious lands that are 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometres south of Portugal.[1] Players can work for an admiral and can either change employment or even retire. Specialized names for the adventures, along with their characteristics and every kind of information possible is synthesized by the combination of certain attributes. The topographic features are created completely by random by a method of biosynthesis.[CR]Elements of war and plague affect the political stability in each of the game's regions. As the years progress in the game, trade and exploration play a role in impacting the in-game economy. Procurement, pestilence and contagious diseases are created through trade; decreasing the number of residents that reside in that particular town or city. These factors may also lead to the loss of vital trade ships. A contingent of information is used in order to enhance the illusion of being taken home. The map in the game is basically close to that of the parts of the Earth that were known in the 15th century. Encyclopedias can be found in the cities in addition to world maps and local specialties. Even animals can be found in the in-game towns. Strange life forms and primitive civilizations are randomly distributed on the map, they are described in the encyclopedia that covers the entire in-game universe. The truths that are accidentally synthesized will also players to get a mysterious world consisting of fictional things. The grotesqueness and strange phenomena can actually been seen and experienced.",

Together with your fellow travellers, Jonjon and Nekketsu, you work your way through a humorous sci-fi story. The gameplay is very standard RPG stuff with towns containing shops, hotels and so on, and the world map throwing up random encounters every few steps. These battles are turn based with the usual mechanics of selecting your attacks and watching them play out - although you have to choose carefully, as you don't default to the next available target when one is destroyed, which will often have you shooting into thin air.",

Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.",

One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...[CR]Blood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard \"RPG-like\" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. [CR]The player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.[CR]Each time an enemy is defeated, the player is rewarded points. There is no separation between money and experience points in this game; the same kind of points is used to buy items, repair and upgrade the Powered Gear. In factories, the player can choose to upgrade the Powered Gear in one of the three categories: body, arms, and legs. Each of these categories has three sub-categories of its own, influencing speed, strength, and other parameters of the body part. Each upgrade cost a certain amount of points; it can also be reversed, and the points invested in another upgrade.[CR]To make \"power leveling\" possible, enemies re-spawn whenever the player-controlled Powered Gear enters an area, and sometimes even if he walks off the screen and comes back.",

                "plot": "SEA SQUARE\", a gigantic man-made island on the Atlantic Ocean, an armed fortress controlled by a mysterious army. It is evident that they are developing the most evil weapon for slaughter to maintain and grasp its superiority of military power in the world. Joint forces have taken the motion for a special a action (irregular combat) and have prepared a mobile weapon \"BROWNING\", to destroy the ultimate weapon....according to the official blurb that is.[CR]Browning is a side scrolling action game that puts the player in a power suit and pits them against hordes of miscellaneous mecha with some very big guns. You walk and shoot, run and shoot and also fly and shoot, although flight time is limited due to the useless engineers failing to fit a large enough fan in your jetpack. After ploughing through a few screens of nasties, you are presented with a particularly unfriendly boss mecha who seems intent on aggressive negotiations. After quickly dispatching said boss, you are free to move on to the next level and do it all over again![CR]You say... [CR]Browning isn't apparently well liked in the gaming community. I have no idea about the background of this game but what I do imagine is that a lot of people might feel ripped off.[CR]The game sports maybe five generic enemies, and is only five levels long. Worse yet, most of them have the boss waiting just a few steps away from the starting point![CR]As far as difficulty goes, the game is hard, but for the wrong reasons. Just the simple act of turning around requires a double tap of the directional button, and if you wanna run in that direction, well...let's just say you are going to take a hit most likely. Worse, your \"shield\" can be fully depleted in two hits, it recharges slowly and once you lose it it's gone and one single hit will make you explode, and force you to restart the stage with a \"continue\" (I don't know if there is a limit to the continues in the game). And the rockets/jets that can make you fly real fast, even backwards, overheat constantly, so they're not gonna be much help either. The game also does not feature any speedups or power ups/different weapon types that I know of.[CR]Overall, your worst enemy in the game will be the time limit. The first level boss can be completely destroyed by just ducking and shooting at it, but the last two levels have the tendency to have more then one boss. It's especially heinous in Stage 4, where I pretty much had to resort to using a cheap trick and being lucky enough to fly over all the enemies in the level up to the boss without shooting them or getting hit once, and even then I had just 12 seconds to spare when I beat the two boss robots that come out once you beat the first one. Level 5 is a little less aggravating, but still, on my first try I blew the boss up 2 seconds before the end of the time limit, and before the game took note of the fact, I blew up (for some reason your employers blow you up if you don't finish your task exactly as planned...sheesh, talk about punctuality). This is due to the fact that the final boss's first weak points (the hands) only take damage when they feel like it. Most of the time you will just shoot at them and nothing will happen and then randomly they will start blinking when hit by your bullets for some reason. I still have no idea what that was about.[CR]And then...the game ends. And if you're like me and you just skip all the cutscenes...you'll end up on the startup screen, wondering what happened. Overall, Browning isn't horrible, but it's not really even mediocre.[CR]apachacha[CR]Cheats/Tips[CR]ARCADE MODE: Pause the game and push SELECT to toggle between arcade and normal modes.",

Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.[CR]Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The \"free play\" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack.

Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.[CR]The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.[CR]There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.",

The gameplay itself is nothing new - you have a primary weapon and optional secondary weapon that is extra powerful, and you have to mow down the Zentradi forces in your Valkyrie (which only gets to transform at specific points). Power-up pods increase your firepower a little each time, while hidden Minmay heads give extra lives.",

Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be \"captured\" and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.[CR]The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other.

Van soon discovers that Laura possesses mysterious powers that may grant immortality to the one who marries her. That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time.[CR]Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: Boken Shonen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes.[CR]Like the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the party frequently, as dictated by the plot; the party may contain up to four active combatants. Story progression and overworld exploration is linear; dungeons are usually fairly complex and maze-like. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story of the game.",

Van awakens after having a nightmare that has been pursuing him after he has left his home planet Idea and joined Cadette Babette (Rim in the Japanese version) as an intergalactic cosmic hunter. However, a meeting with a friend in trouble from convinces him that his quest is just about to begin. Van and his Little Fox Team must return to Idea, and face the shadows of Van's tragic past.The gameplay is virtually identical to that of the first chapter, and has little deviation from the traditional Japanese RPG formula: the player navigates a party of heroes over the top-down world, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based fashion. Like in the previous game, the  Final Fantasy-like ATB bar indicates the speed of the characters' turns during the battles. The second chapter also opens with a \"digital comic\" (basically a typical Japanese-style adventure), but after this introduction the RPG gameplay takes over for the rest of the game.",

                "plot": "The fourth installment of the sci-fi RPG series comes in two parts, this game being the first. In it, the player once again takes control of the original hero of the series, the cosmic hunter Yu, his lovely female comrade Saya, and their friends. Something is wrong on the planet Kazarin: the princess Saria was kidnapped, and Yu arrives on the planet to look closer into that matter, while Saya agrees to impersonate the princess for a while to ensure a calm investigation. However, their quest goes far beyond the kidnapping investigation: soon they will have to face the four heavenly kings, demons who control the elements from which the universe is built.The game features a role-playing system similar to the first three installments of the series and other Japanese RPGs: the player navigates a party of characters (up to four active combatants) around the top-down overworld, visiting towns, buying equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. A new introduction to the series is an ATB (active-time battle) bar (which came to prominence after having been first implemented by Final Fantasy IV): the player can only execute an action when the bar of the character in question is filled; therefore, switching between characters and reacting quickly becomes a necessity. The game begins with a \"digital comic\" introduction typical for most Japanese adventures (with menu commands to interact with still anime-style pictures); however, this gameplay mode disappears shortly afterwards and plays no further role.The mild erotic elements characteristic of the previous episodes have been somewhat intensified in this installment; a few scenes feature nudity in context of a sexual situation.",

                "plot": "A powerful wizard, yearning for even more power, has found a sacred book that granted him command over armies of demons and men. Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.[CR]Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to  Pandora's  RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in  Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of  Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as \"Attack\", \"Use Magic\", etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.",

The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.[CR]Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.[CR]Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, \"boxing glove\" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.",

It appears that Foltjunia has lost her transformation abilities. Her sisters decide to stay with Takaya for a while, masquerading as high-school girls, which greatly complicates the young man's social and romantic life.Having the same characters and initial plot as Hatsukoi Monogatari, Denno Tenshi: Digital Ange is a Japanese-style adventure game with very limited interaction and strictly linear progression. Most screens allow the player to choose verb commands such as \"Look\", \"Talk\", \"Watch\", \"Go\", etc. from a menu, usually combining them with character and object names in a sub-menu. Typically, going through most or all options triggers the next event.",

Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time.",

Shion was renamed Dyna and was modeled after a Hercules Beetle, and the final boss was changed to a giant lizard king. An English-language version was also produced, but both were built off of the Japanese version of Wonder Boy in Monster World.

Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.",

The graphics consist of flat shaded corridors. Enemies are all simple geometric shapes with smiley faces on them. Although the graphics are simple, they allow for full freedom of movement, not unlike Wolfenstein 3-D.[CR]There are two modes of play. First there is a single player mode in which your goal is to find the exit to each level. There are 70 mazes in this mode. The second mode is the multiplayer arena.

Kabuki, this looks like an adventure for you![CR]The third game in  Tengai Makyo series has an even more distinct humorous undertone and features even more wacky anim-style cut scenes. Gameplay-wise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with party members, towns, dungeons, and random enemy encounters.

It seems that the followers of this evil organization have raised their ugly heads again! Several young girls are kidnapped, and Orochimaru suspects it was the work of Daimon Cult. Kabuki, this looks like an adventure for you![CR]The third game in  Tengai Makyo series has an even more distinct humorous undertone and features even more wacky anim-style cut scenes. Gameplay-wise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with party members, towns, dungeons, and random enemy encounters. Unlike the two previous games, the battles are fought from top-down third person perspective.",

One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate. Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down. Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells. A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.",

The galaxy police sends two agents to deal with the threat: Hiro Aoyama and Michiko Akasaka, who can transform into the powerful super-fighters Gayvan and Mittchi, respectively, and are alone able to stop Ballas.[CR]Galaxy Deka Gayvan is a brawler. Players can choose to control either of the two heroes, or both of them in a co-op mode. Like in other beat-em-up games, the player must defeat all the enemies on screen in hand-to-hand combat before being able to proceed. Both Hiro and Michiko can accumulate special energy (dropped by the enemies along with health power-ups and money) that allows them to transfer into the superheroes Gayvan and Mittchi and stay in that form until they run out of energy. The superhero forms are stronger and are able to execute special attacks.[CR]In addition, a two-player versus fighting mode is included. Players can choose either the protagonists or three enemy characters to compete against each other in one-on-one fighting.",

However, the computer grew increasingly megalomaniac, and eventually decided to conquer the Earth with deadly machines of its own production. In the middle of the 23rd century, humanity engages in a decisive battle against MESIA. Their hopes lie with Ken Ryugasaki, who pilots the powerful mecha Tracer on his journey to the super-computer's lair. Genocide is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Tracer, who can fight with a sword-like melee weapon and jump. Later in the game Tracer acquires Betty, a powerful weapon that can shoot in eight directions. The gameplay is fairly straightforward; there are no power-ups, and the bulk of the game consists of surviving continuous onslaughts of enemies.",

There is no in-game background story or plot-advancing cutscenes, with the exception of a wise old man who would sometimes offer the cat-suit-clad hero some help. Creatures from Japanese mythology have gone wild, and it is up to the flying protagonist to defeat them, all the while defending himself against enraged villagers, mechanical cats, homoerotic wrestlers and other grotesque beings. The player character is armed with a standard gun in the beginning, which shoots in two lines straight in front of him. Power-ups are obtained by flying over treasure chests, usually placed on top of the screen. These grant the hero wingmen, additional shots, a new ray attack, extra lives, etc. Like in most scrolling shooters, a button is assigned to a powerful all-screen attack (in this case throwing coins) with limited charges. Stages culminate in boss battles, and some of them are built as a series of mini-boss encounters.",

The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.[CR]The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.[CR]The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal \"punch-kick\" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.",

The king has sent an army to rescue his daughter, led by a knight who was carrying the legendary Sword of the Valiant. All the soldiers were killed by the minions of the Demon God, and only the brave knight survived. But as he delivered the fatal blow to the Demon God, he was himself mortally wounded by him. The princess Misa has no other choice but to take the Sword of the Valiant and to find a way to escape from the Demon God's dungeon, full of deadly traps and enemies...[CR]Gtzendiener (for some reason the title is German, meaning \"idolator\"), made by the creators of  Princess Maker, presents its own take on \"rescue the princess\" story: here, there is nobody who can rescue the princess but herself. Armed with the sword, the princess must explore the isometric dungeon, fighting enemies in real-time combat and solving environmental puzzles on the way. The princess jumps automatically, and the actions in the game are limited to attacking enemies with a sword and pushing and pulling objects.",

Each character is able to cast magic spells, and the more potions you have, the more impressive and powerful the spells are. Gilius casts lightning spells, which are the weakest, Ax casts earthquake spells and Tyris casts powerful fire spells which can be powered up to give you a giant dragon that breathes flames all over the landscape.",

With a total of nine stages, this perfect port of the original boasts one of the longest adventures in the series and features more of its trademark fast-paced background music to accompany the intense action!",

The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a \"loyalty\" parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off.",

The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon- red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.",

Three commanders are available initially, while others can be called into battle later. Once a player-controlled and an enemy unit meet on the same dot, the player can order the commander to attack, defend, or retreat. The battle then proceeds automatically, its result calculated by the statistics of both units. The role-playing element involves leveling up mecha parts; a number of experience points is awarded after a battle, and the player can freely distribute them to raise the mecha's parameters.",

There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. [CR]The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.[CR]Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.[CR]As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more \"mainstream\" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.",

Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike.The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment.

It is possible to choose club types and (in the practice mode) golf course. The game is played from a first-person perspective, and requires the player to stop a moving bar at the correct moment to regulate the strength of the short.[CR]Formation Soccer: Human Cup '92 is a top-down soccer (football) game that allows the player to choose an international team out of several available European and American ones. Formation and goaltender behavior can be customized; however, no detailed player management is present. The championship mode allows one or two players to compete against the computer.[CR]Final Match Tennis Ladies is similar in style to Final Match Tennis, but with notable female tennis players (their names are slightly altered). It is possible to choose one of the three available tennis court types, as well as go through the Australian Open tournament controlling one competitor in a cup system.",

Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.",

Each \"enemy\" will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will \"kill\" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can be used to restore HP, reduce the time limit, return to a town, etc.",

Humanity tries to rebuild itself from the aftermath of the first Image Fight - the computer on the moon was destroyed and peace had finally returned. But three years after the attack, a space probe detects unknown objects hurtling towards planet Earth. The signs are clear - a massive alien invasion is underway. After a first encounter around Saturn, Image Fight requires the player to progress through four \"simulation stages\" - the last six \"real stages\" can only be accessed if the \"simulation\" achievement rating is greater enough. Failing this requirements leads to a short but intense Penalty Area. All the primary weapons from the original game are also here for the taking. Up to three colored orbs can be attached to the ship and either fire forwards (blue) or in the opposite way the ship is moving (Red). Secondary devices are also available and can be equipped at the front of the ship - they include all kind of lasers and missiles. However the only way to switch to a different device is to receive a direct hit.",

It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. [CR]This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.",

Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.[CR]Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.",

Divan must use his robot transformation abilities to defeat them, which can only be done when playing mahjong.[CR]The mahjong gameplay in this installment of the series is identical to that of its predecessor, including points distribution and execution of powerful transformation moves to gain the upper hand in the round. Unlike the previous games in the series, this chapter eschews the rudimentary adventure gameplay, featuring long non-interactive cutscenes between mahjong matches. Another change is the addition of a new mode that allows the player to compete against opponents from the story mode at any time, without going through the story.",

They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.[CR]Saver Angels restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special \"mahjong mode\" allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.",

The game follows the same story for the most part, and contains the cut scenes from the original version. Like most PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD games, it features voice acting during cut scenes and CD audio tracks.[CR]Several cut scenes were added, and some dialogues expanded. Though the story progression and the areas the characters have to traverse in order to advance it remain intact most of the time, the gameplay system has received an overhaul, being essentially developed from scratch. The \"RPG-lite\" feel of the original version is now somewhat compensated by the ability to equip weapons and armor, as in most RPGs. Combat engine has also been modified; instead of the isometric battle screens of the original, the battles are now viewed from \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person perspective, with player-controlled characters visibly attacking the foes, similarly to  Phantasy Star IV.",

He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.[CR]Kagami no Kuni no Legend is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as \"Examine\" or \"Talk\" appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the \"Move\" command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.[CR]Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.",

The game counts ten different fighters : Jenius, Asasin, Arcer, Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. Every single one of them has different attacks and set of techniques the player has to learn and master. Controls are fairly simple and straight forward - one button executes a short attack and the other a long attack. If both bottons are pressed, the fighter grabs and throws his enemy in the air. Most of the fighters in Algunos use their bare hands but some also use weapons like swords (which was quite an unusual feature back when the game was published).",

                "plot": "An evil demon has emerged from the ruins of a sacred temple. A young woman named Erena is persecuted by the militant Hielun Empire, who pursues its own agenda and is convinced that Erena has a mysterious connection to the demon's powers. However, a knight named Vaice and his friends rescue Erena and prepare to defend her, gradually becoming involved in a large-scale armed conflict. Kiso Louga is a turn-based strategy game. The gameplay consists entirely of battles, with anime-style cutscenes advancing the story between missions. The player navigates individual characters in an overhead locations. A contact with an enemy unit initiates a separate battle, where the player selects commands (Attack, Item, Special, etc.) from a menu. Castles play an important role during battles: characters can retreat and heal in a player-controlled castle, and conquering an enemy castle is often required as well as part of the mission's objective. Castles may be defended by arches, catapults, etc., and their gates must be destroyed by attacking them. Missions often involve battles between multiple sides. Despite the RPG-like menus, individual statistics, and equipment management, there are no real role-playing elements in the game, since characters do not level up or become stronger in another fashion.",

Shortly thereafter he encounters a young woman named Tifire, who describes herself as a fellow Guardian. Vaice and his friends soon draw the ire of a might empire and have to fight for their lives and the destiny of what they hold dear.The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, consisting of turn-based battles between Vaice's party and various enemy organizations. Role-playing elements have been enhanced, featuring an experience points system that makes character growth available. Like in the first game, contact with an enemy initiates a separate battle. These battles are more tactical in this installment, taking place on an isometric screen and allowing character movement.",

Gulliver is a young boy who studies magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world![CR]Kuso Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy, released originally on Turbo CD, is not the same game as the  SNES release, even though it is set in the same world and features the same heroes. Unlike the SNES game, which was an action RPG, this is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes a fairly standard battle system with a four-heroes party, attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the screen and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than being random. [CR]The game features some full-motion anime-style movies (instead of comic-book-like cut scenes typical for Turbo CD games) and voice acting.",

It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...[CR]Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.",

After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life![CR]The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to  Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to \"bump\" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.[CR]The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.[CR]There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.",

In addition, a powerful all-screen attack can be executed by pressing the second action button.

Neo Kenya is the name of a world that is in danger of being completely annihilated by an asteroid. The armies of Neo Kenya have searched for every conceivably way to prevent the coming catastrophe. When the inhabitants of the world turn to a dark god, their prayers and nightmares come true. The game was originally released for the PC-Engine in 1995 under the title of Linda3. Players start the game off with two characters, Linda and Ken.[CR]The story in the game is portrayed through a series of cutscenes, which for the most part are voiced. Action in the game is split up by events that show the deplorable nature of the characters in the face of impending doom.[CR]Three gameplay modes are offered at the beginning, and differ in difficulty and focus.[CR]Capturing monsters is the device used to advanced the plot. The combat in the game plays out similar to Dragon Quest. The combat is represented via text with sprites on the screen representing the enemies. As players capture different monsters, they can use them to give Linda and Ken new abilities and advance the plot. As players wander around the world collecting creatures the time in the game advances in real time. Players only have a set number of gameplay hours to bring as many creatures as possible back to the ship, or Ken and Linda will be left to die on the planet as everyone else evacuates.[CR]The game's story combines psychological elements with voodoo and the occult. The two main characters in the game are Ken, an army soldier tasked with the job of catching monsters; and his girlfriend Linda, who is used by the military as a surrogate for the god's plans. The inhabitants of the Neo Kenya called upon a god by the name of Anubis (a reference to the Egyptian lord of the underworld) in order to protect them from imminent destruction. Apparently answering their calls, the dark god sent an Ark similar to Noah's Ark. He demands that a man and a woman gather two of every animal on the planet. The army nominated Ken and Linda to achieve this task.",

The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.[CR]Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be \"reversed\", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.",

                "plot": "Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called \"drafts\" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called \"distaff\". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.[CR]Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be \"reversed\", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.",

Enemies drop currency which is needed for buying new weapons, healing or using the game's hint system.Shape Shifter was released exclusively for the TurboGrafx-CD in Japan and the US.

                "plot": "Martial Champion is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Street Fighter II. There are ten characters to choose from, each representing his or her own country. The main protagonist is a Japanese martial artist named Jin; others include his countryman Zen, a kabuki fighter; a Chinese kung-fu expert and a vampire from Hong-Kong; an Egyptian princess; a scimitar fighter from Saudi Arabia; a spear-wielding Kenyan warrior; a French weapons specialist; and two North Americans - an eyepatched soldier and a blonde female ninja-like fighter. [CR]There are three modes in the game: a tournament mode, in which these characters compete against each other before facing the final boss; a versus mode; and a group fighting mode, in which each player selects several fighters to represent in a series of one-on-one battles. The fighting scheme resembles that of Yie Ar Kung Fu, though with a simplified handling of high, medium, and low attacks. Some of the characters use weapons in battles; it is possible to knock these weapons out of their hands and use them against their owners.",

Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...[CR]La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.[CR]However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.[CR]The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no \"world map\", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on \"level-grinding\"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.",

You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.[CR]Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.",

Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world![CR]Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an \"old-school\" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called \"performing\" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.[CR]Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Minesweeper is a game included in all iterations of Windows from Windows 3.1 onward. The game consists of squares arranged in a rectangular grid. Some of the squares have mines hidden under them. If you left-click on a square with a mine under it then you lose. If there isn't a mine, then a number appears indicating the number of mines under adjacent squares. If there are no mines in any of the nearby squares, then it automatically clears those squares. The object of the game is to clear every square that doesn't have a mine. To make this easier, you can mark squares that you believe to have a mine with a flag. Also, some versions of the game allow you to place a question mark as an option. The game tells you the number of mines left that you have not marked. Also, the game clock records the speed with which you have completed the game. If you complete the game in a record amount of time for a given difficulty, then it saves your time and alias.The game includes three standard difficulty modes and a custom difficulty. The difference between the different modes is the size of the rectangular grid and the number of mines. The custom difficulty mode in the Vista version lets you set the height, width, and number of mines independently. The standard difficulty modes areBeginner: 9x9 grid, 10 minesIntermediate: 16x16 grid, 40 minesExpert: 16x30 grid, 99 minesUsing the Custom Mode, you can make the mine count as high as 667 with a 24x30 grid on Windows XP and Windows Vista.Using logic, it is possible to improve your odds of winning, but in some situations it is just luck. Maximizing your odds of succeeding is actually very difficult since it requires probability analysis. It is not enough to calculate the odds of a particular square having a mine. Rather, you must also consider the information revealed if there is no mine.[CR]Windows 8[CR]Minesweeper will receive a graphical update with the release of Microsoft Windows 8 in October. It's currently not clear what other new features it will release with (if any), but screenshots indicate, at least, a revamp visually.[CR]Records[CR]Many people have scored 1 second on beginner, which is the minimum score possible.The record time for intermediate difficulty is 7.27 seconds, set by Kamil Muranski of Poland. VideoThe record time for expert difficulty is 31.133 seconds, also set by Kamil Muranski of Poland. Video",

The player can check the dossier of all the twenty students at any time and learn more about them. The game features digitized photos of real people instead of the more common anime-style character graphics.[CR]Gameplay-wise, the game features a traditional menu containing verb commands for examining the environment, talking to characters, checking the inventory, moving to another location, etc.; most of these verbs lead to a list of possible objects to interact with. There are no puzzles, but a few instances require the player to make the right choices in order to continue the game; in other cases it is possible to slightly branch the plot by making a decision.",

You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.[CR]In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. [CR]In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.[CR]If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.",

No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.[CR]Moonlight Lady can be called a \"pseudo-RPG\"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with strong adventure elements and no true role-playing system. [CR]Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.[CR]Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.[CR]A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.",

Every course only occupies one screen, and the player has to complete laps faster than AI-controlled cars or race against time. Multiplayer (for two or four players) is also available. Time attack mode allows the player to select any course from twenty-five available ones, thematically grouped in five categories- Circuit (resembling racing tracks), City (urban locations), Nature (field, beach, desert, etc.), Marchen (colorful fairy tale-like courses), and Special (unorthodox designs, e.g. a giant ape overlooking a road). Courses usually include various hazards that slow down or trap cars, as well as turbo fields that speed them up.

The player pilots the Slasher, a powerful space fighter, and prepares to face the oncoming threat. The introduction story is told through a series of fully animated cutscenes and reveals the intricate plot of the game. We learn that stopping the invasion is not our pilot's only goal - he is also on a quest of revenge after a fatal encounter with a large red mecha and the terrible loss, in front of his very eyes, of a close friend and fellow female pilot. He makes his way towards the enemy lines on his own, ready to launch a deadly ambush attack. The Slasher starts its mission with a standard Vulcan gun (\"Rapid Shot/Wide Shot\") and more weapons are available along the way such as homing flame-lasers (\"Guided Fire\"), side missiles (\"Crawl Missile\"), lasers, shields and secondary flying pods (\"Funnel\"). Unlike most of its peers, Nexzr is as bare as it gets on the weapon/power-up side. It features only one fire button and weapons have a single power level and can't be powered-up, without forgetting the total lack of smart bombs. Interestingly, the option menu offers a special arcade mode that shrinks the screen horizontally and offers a narrower field of view.",

The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.[CR]One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.",

The game's plot is rather abstract and serves to tie together various time periods to which the hero travels after completing pachinko-playing sections. In each area there are casinos with pachinko machines. The player can talk to characters in the casino, exchange money for chips and vice versa, and play pachinko on variously themed machines. New areas become accessible after the player has won a sufficient amount of money in the previous casino.",

Robots can be humanoid, machine-like, rolling on wheels, able to fly or transform into different forms, etc.[CR]After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves allow no control from the side of the player.[CR]A \"league mode\" is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete against each other in a tournament.",

Three commands -- Look, Talk, and Move -- appear on every screen. The player selects these commands (there are no sub-menus with objects) to move between locations, examine rooms, talk to characters, and ultimately advance the storyline. The game also contains a variety of features (robot database, interviews with voice actors, etc.) accessible from the main menu, as well as a rock-paper-scissors mini-game starring various Labors.",

Mail tried at least to sell the head in the nearest town, but discovered that the local tavern was full of these heads stored in a basket. But not all is lost- Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for! This version of Popful Mail is quite different from later releases, even though it has the same story and basic gameplay. However, the layout of locations, regular enemies, bosses, concrete events - everything is entirely different. This version is less of a fast-paced platformer and is more focused on exploration, with more maze-like levels and back-tracking. As in the other versions, there are friendly areas where Mail can buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no attack button- Mail attacks by simply running into enemies or jumping on them.",

You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing.

For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.[CR]It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.[CR]Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.[CR]The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.",

The woman has a strange request that makes Furuyagi doubt her sanity. For generations, a beautiful doll has been in the possession of her family; however, recently it has disappeared, and the woman is convinced the culprit is the devil himself. Furuyagi travels to the countryside where he begins to investigate this unusual mystery, determined to find out the truth.Orgel plays similarly to previous installment in the Psychic Detective series. The bulk of the game is occupied by conversations with characters, which often involve talking about various topics, gathering information. There are no puzzles, but pieces of evidence can be collected, stored, and viewed as inventory items. The interaction with the game world is menu-based.",

While the game is considered an erotic \"strip mahjong\" game (as defeating opponents reveal scantily-clad women), the game does not include explicit nudity.Like its predecessor, the game includes various RPG elements, such as experience points (where players can level up to unlock new power-ups, or \"spells\"), currency (where players can buy items), hit points (replacing mahjong score), and mana points (required to use spells). It also includes a high fantasy story and numerous tropes, stylized with a top-down overworld system (where the player character moves automatically) reminiscent of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.It was later ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM2 (requiring the Arcade Card add-on) on February 24, 1995 (published by NEC) and the Neo Geo CD on March 31, 1995 (published by SNK), both versions exclusive to Japan.",

The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called \"F1 Grand Prix\", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.",

After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them.The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called \"F1 Grand Prix\", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.",

Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging \"boss battle\".[CR]Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back.

The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question.[CR]Another mode in the game is called \"Megaten Quest\"; however, it is not a Megami Tensei related quiz, but rather an imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading to puzzle solutions, and is essentially the multiplayer portion of the game.

Correct answers damage the enemy, while wrong answers deplete the hero's life. The amount of possible answer to select from and the nature of trivia questions varies from quest to quest.Other modes include a multiplayer tournament, a time attack mode in which players have to answer as many questions as possible within a time limit, and two multiplayer modes that allows players to represent various characters and mimic a fighting game and a Formula 1 Grand Prix.",

He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.[CR]This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a \"beat-'em-up\" side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters. [CR]Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.",

                "plot": "Based on the Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Toraware no Hanayome consists of several chapters, which are similar to episodes of a TV show: each one has its own story and theme, but all the chapters have recurrent characters from the Ranma 1/2 universe. As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.[CR]Unlike most other Ranma 1/2 iterations, this game is a so-called \"digital comic\", which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.",

Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.[CR]This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.",

The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.[CR]The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game.

But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.[CR]Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this \"baby action\", the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).[CR]Instead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.). The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The game focuses on exploration, having large and complex locations as well as plenty of items of different categories that can be found if the player explores the game world properly.",

The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin, Hojo Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.[CR]Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc. Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies.[CR]When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the invaders from castle walls.",

The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves. Actresses appear topless in these dances.",

He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.[CR]As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.[CR]Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the \"very challenging\" and the \"impossible\". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.",

Much of the game consists of traversing hostile areas, fighting regular enemies on the way and defeating bosses. The game's \"hub\" area is a town where Lykos can replenish his health and buy any of the three available weapons (axe, mace, or bow). These weapons can be upgraded by enchanting them or picking up power-ups.[CR]After Lykos rescues a wizard he gains access to a transformation power. Transformations require special gems and cannot be performed if Lykos runs out of them. There are four transformations in the game: the panther can jump over large gaps; the shark can swim; the golem can jump higher; and the golden dragon can fly. Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.[CR]The game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area. Lykos has eight lives consisting of smaller health units (hearts). The game can only be saved in the town.",

As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool.[CR]\"Wake up!\" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.",

Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.",

The player assumes the role of Gillian Seed, a new recruit to an elite police task force known as J.U.N.K.E.R. The player's goal is to investigate the emergence of the mysterious race known as the Snatchers, a race of cybernetic beings that kill humans and steal their appearance. The game takes place in the year 2046 on the artificial island of Neo Kobe 50 years after the explosion of a warhead destroyed large parts of eastern Europe in an event called the \"Catastrophe.\" The game draws heavily from popular science fiction movies such as Blade Runner, Terminator, Akira and Aliens in both setting and character design as well as containing references to other Konami projects such as Metal Gear, Contra, Goemon and Castlevania. The game saw a remake which used a super-deformed art style with RPG style gameplay, known as SD Snatcher.Originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in Japan in 1988, the game has been remade several times for various platforms, including the PC-Engine CD, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The only English language translation was released for the SegaCD/MegaCD in Europe and America on December 15, 1994. The Sega CD version was the first to have light gun support, using Sega's Justifier light gun peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shall I investigate Mika?Snatcher is a heavily text-based adventure, and most images are shown in a first person perspective, though there are a few cinematic shots. Throughout the game, the player is given a menu in order to interact with their environment. Most often, players have the 'Look' and 'Investigate' options available for interaction with the environment, and 'Use Metal Gear' and Inventory' options for other things. In special situations, players can speak with other characters, and show them items. At times, Gillian can also smell and search areas (or people). In most cases, the player must use choices more than once to get a complete picture of events and to move the story forward.There are special instances in the game where further interaction is available. First, there is one particular area that players can search with a flashlight. More commonly, the player must use their blaster to take down enemies. When the opportunity arises, players press a specified button to draw their weapon, and another button to fire. A grid is shown on the screen which the player navigates in order to take out enemies. Both of these sequences are not common occurrences. The game was originally meant to be played with a light gun for the shooting sequences.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Act 1: SnatchThis cyberpunk adventure begins as Gillian Seed begins his first day on the Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Ranger (J.U.N.K.E.R.) force, dedicated to protecting Humanity from murderous cybernetic criminals known as \"Snatchers\". We learn in the beginning that Gillian and his wife both have amnesia, and were discovered a few years prior. He and his wife, lacking memory of their relationship, are not seeing each other very often anymore. Gillian is shown around J.U.N.K.E.R. headquarters, where he meets Mika Slayton, the engineer Harry Benson, and the Chief Benson Cunningham. Gillian receives his blaster and his navigator, Metal Gear Mk.II. As soon as Gillian meets his partner, he receives a videophone call through Metal Gear from another J.U.N.K.E.R., Jean Jack Gibson. Jean Jack Gibson is in trouble, and needs help immediately. Gillian, though it is only his first day on the job, rushes off to complete his first task as a Junker. He rushes to the wreckage of an old building from which the call was made.Gillian with his blasterUpon arrival, the presence of an artificial pollen called Snow 9 is discovered, which is a sign of Snatcher presence. Gillian and Metal Gear go and explore the building, but all they find are the remains of Gibson's navigator, Little John, and Gibson's corpse. They discover that Gibson's head had been twisted off, something only a Snatcher would have the strength to do. They investigate to discover clues on both Gibson's corpse and Little John's memory bank. No Snatchers seem to be present, however, so the two move out to further investigate, hoping to identify the Snatcher that killed Gibson.Everyone at J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ is very hurt by the news that Jean Jack is dead, complicating the situation for Gillian. He consoles his comrades, and then moves forward in the investigation by searching Gibson's house. Gillian goes to Jean Jack's home, and speaks with his daughter, Katrina. While searching the home, he finds critical information regarding the identification of Snatchers. He learns that their artificial skin cannot cope with ultraviolet radiation, requiring them to operate at night, and use sunscreen at all times. As soon as he has this info, he moves out, hoping to utilize this to discover Gibson's murderer. Gillian also discovers an acquaintance of Jean Jack's, an informant codenamed \"Napoleon\". Napoleon provides information about Plato's Cavern and Outer Heaven, two places well known in the Neo-Kobe underground.Gillian's search leads him to a black market dealer and an underground restaurant, the only place in Neo Kobe that serves buffalo meat (which had been found in Gibson's stomach). He goes to this restaurant, Outer Heaven, and interrogates both the manager and one of the strippers. These interrogations give him a description of the man who must have killed Gibson, and Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ to use this description. The features described by the hooker at Outer Heaven lead Gillian to two suspects: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Gillian and Metal Gear first head to Rodriguez's apartment, located in a very rough area of town. When they get to his residence, Ivan comes out shooting. Gillian quickly disarms and interrogates him. Upon further investigation, evidence reveals that Ivan is not a Snatcher. All is not in vain, however, as Ivan is in possession of an illegal drug, explaining his actions, and he is later arrested by civilian police. Gillian now goes to find the other suspect, Freddy Nielsen.Gillian arrives at the Nielsen home only to discover Freddy isn't around. After questioning Nielsen's wife and searching for concrete evidence of Freddy's state, Gillian is attacked by his wife, who is a Snatcher. After killing her, Gillian and Metal Gear leave the scene, but as they do, a light comes on. They go back to figure out what happened, only to be attacked by Freddy Nielsen. Nielsen has Gillian by the neck, and Gillian seems helpless. Just before all hope is lost, a civilian bounty hunter, Random Hajile, saves Gillian.Act 2: CureGillian's first move in Act 2 is to find any information he can about the Snatchers' illicit hospital where they treat their skin. First, by searching the memory banks of Little John, an image of a neon sign that says 'Hospital Oleen' is discovered. For further information, Gillian seeks out Napoleon. Napoleon knows of an Oleen hospital, and provides Gillian with information on it for the right price. Gillian and Metal Gear rush to Oleen hospital, only to discover it is a veterinary clinic. Without bothering to investigate inside, they assume that the neon sign in the image from Little John must have been broken, and they need to find more clues.Benson's officeOnce the two finish speaking to Napoleon, they receive an urgent call concerning Katina Gibson. She had called in a panic earlier, requesting Gillian's help. Gillian immediately travels to her home, to find it torn apart. Gillian observes the scene, and finds evidence that it is a Snatcher's doing. When Gillian is just about to leave to find Katrina, Alice, the Gibsons' dog, is thrown through the window in a bloody mess. Hoping to find Katrina in one piece, Gillian and Metal Gear search for any place they may find her. When their search yields no results, they return to Gillian's apartment. Once the pair arrives at the apartment, they discover someone has been there.They enter cautiously and find that someone is using the bathroom. Slowly, they enter, and open the shower only to find Katrina, who quickly sprays Gillian in fright. Once she is decent, it is time for an explanation. Gillian questions Katrina, and she tells him why she came to his house, and what the Snatchers were doing in her home; She had found more clues. All three of them then attempt to figure out what was missing from Little John's image. They conclude that the Snatcher hospital is not \"Oleen\", rather, it is Queen's Hospital. With this newfound information, Gillian and Metal Gear head for their next destination.Upon arriving at Queen's Hospital, our heroes find a dark, abandoned building. It seems no one has been there for ages. The continue their investigation to find some interesting things in one of the rooms. They find a map of Russia, which is consistent with the Snatchers' strange obsession with Russia, and one piece of patient data left behind. The patient record is written in a complex form of Chinese, so the two need help to decode it. Once again, Gillian seeks the help of Napoleon.Gillian and Metal Gear find Napoleon at Outer Heaven. Luckily, Napoleon, a purebred Chinese man, knows the symbols on the patient record. It is a puzzle involving the periodic table. The group decodes the message, discovering the patient's name is 'Benson.' Shocked, Gillian rushes off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ; there are only two Bensons he knows of. Unfortunately, neither the Chief nor Harry are at HQ. Gillian thoroughly searches the building for any clue, and finds a message from Harry. \"Face to Face\" is all that he left for them. Gillian further searches, realizing what this clue means. It refers to a painting in the Chief's office, an optical illusion, which shows both a vase and two faces. Gillian investigates, and discovers an image of Red Square in Moscow behind the painting. Believing that the Chief is probably a Snatcher, they leave to try and track him down. As they are leaving, they receive a videophone call from Gillian's wife, Jamie Seed. She has somehow discovered that Queen's Hospital installed a basement. This must be where they are operating from! Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to the hospital.All does not go as planned, however. As soon as they begin driving the turbocycle, they discover it has been sabotaged. Gillian constantly struggles to find a way to stop the vehicle, but to no avail. Once again, Random Hajile comes to the rescue just before Gillian meets his end. Random joins the two, and they head to the hospital.Once they arrive, they immediately search for and find the secret basement. They search all around, and eventually come across the Snatchers' morgue, containing four Human corpses. Metal Gear analyzes the bodies, to identify them and find out if the Snatchers had assumed their identities. The first two bodies are the Nielsens, the second is Chin Shu Oh, who once ran the hospital... and the third to Chief Benson Cunningham. With this new discovery, the three attempt to leave, only to encounter Chin Shu Oh and other Snatchers. All hope seems lost, but Random has one last trick up his sleeve. He tells Gillian to escape through a nearby ventilation shaft, and he uses explosives attached to himself to take down the building in a suicide attack.After the explosion, Gillian and Metal Gear find themselves in a long shaft, and observe that it was likely used by Snatchers to travel. They go further down to find it connects to an abandoned subway rail, which the Snatchers must have used to get around. They walk through the Snatcher Underground Railroad, looking for an exit. They eventually come across a ladder, which appears to take them out. They use this ladder, only to end up in the Nielsens home. They conclude this must have been how Freddy Nielsen entered the home without being noticed to attack Gillian. They had to get back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ immediately, and leave.NapoleonTo get back to HQ, Gillian calls up a taxi. When Gillian requests he be taken to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ, the driver acts strangely. It turns out that the driver is actually Chin Shu Oh, and Gillian takes him out. Once that is over, they rush off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ in the comandeered taxi.When Gillian arrives, he finds that someone has attacked HQ. Mika has been locked into her pod, and Metal Gear attempts to open it. Once open, they find Mika unconscious. They revive her, and she tells them that Harry ran in after Chief Cunningham, and locked the door behind. She allows them to go inside, and they dash inside to help Harry. Gillian and Metal Gear find Harry laying in a pool of his own blood. Harry tells them how he discovered that the Chief was a Snatcher, but was no match for the murderous robot. Harry then dies in Gillian's arms. Enraged, Gillian is determined to get revenge for Harry's death. Once again, he searches HQ. Gillian finds the Chief clinging to the ceiling of his office, and kills him.Act 3: JunkAct 3 begins with Gillian, Metal Gear, and Mika going over all that has happened up to that point. They discuss the Snatchers' weaknesses, those who have been discovered to be Snatchers, and the mysterious information that has been gathered. Upon studying all they know, they notice some actual links between the Snatchers and Russia, the country they're so obsessed with. It seems the Snatchers all consider this place their home.At this time, Metal Gear reveals that he actually knows all about Gillian and his mysterious past. Gillian and his wife Jamie were found cryogenically frozen in a Russian facility near the spot where the Catastrophe, a nuclear attack that devastated all of Europe, had occurred. There was one other pod, but it was empty. Jamie and Gillian both had amnesia as a result of the cryogenic suspension, and knew nothing. After inexplicably moving to Japan, Gillian joined the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad hoping it would help him recover their lost memories. Gillian also discovers that Harry Benson was he and Jamie's fully grown son.Shocking revelationsThe three decide to find the place that the Snatchers are gathered in Neo-Kobe. The conclude it must be in an area near a river from which Snow 9 originates, and a place easily accessible through the subway tunnels. All signs point to the Snatchers hiding in an old abandoned chapel, which somehow seems to line up with the Moscow river. Gillian, deciding this must be the secret hideout of the Snatchers, rushes to the scene.Unfortunately for the J.U.N.K.E.R.s, time is short. The Kyoto Summit discussing the Snatcher problem is getting together, and in approximately three hours, all authority J.U.N.K.E.R. has will be dissolved. They would also vote whether or not to completely destroy Neo-Kobe with nuclear weapons to end the Snatcher threat once and for all. Gillian must work quickly.Once Gillian and Metal Gear arrive, they find the church empty. The enter, and see a portrait of a man called \"Modnar,\" who is clearly Random Hajile. They go further in, and find the snatchers being prepared to act as humans. They find data planning to snatch and replace many major world leaders and Gillian himself. With little time left, Metal Gear psychotically reveals that if ordered to by Kyoto, he will murder Gillian. Gillian asks Metal Gear to go out and attempt to convince the delegates in Kyoto to give him more time. Metal Gear agrees, and leaves Gillian to continue by himself.Gillian moves on, and encounters numerous Snatchers. He kills them and moves into the final chamber, where he finds Jamie, who explains how she was captured and taken to work on the development of a perfect artificial skin for the Snatchers with Dr. Modnar. Dr. Modnar was well past 100 years of age, however, and had passed on minutes before Gillian's arrival. Jamie cries about how she did it because they threatened to take their son's life, and Gillian tells her how their son, Harry, was already murdered by the Snatchers.Taking out a SnatcherAnother man reveals himself at this point. An old man in a wheelchair, Dr. Elijah Modnar. He had captured is father, the elder Dr. Modnar, to perfect his snatchers. He describes to Jamie and Gillian how he was recruited long ago to work on this project with them to simulate humans. The Snatchers were intended as a means of taking power over all other nations, the ultimate weapon. He worked on the team with Jamie, and fell in love with her. At one point in time, his only motivation to work was his love for her. Later, Gillian was hired to work with the psychological properties of the Snatchers. Jamie and Gillian fell in love and were married. Elijah was furious at this, and plotted to end it all. He set off the massive weapon Lucifer Alpha, creating the Catastrophe, and had Gillian and Jamie join him in cryogenic freezing. His plan was to leave Gillian frozen, and awaken Jamie so they could live together in peace. When he final woke up, however, he could not bring himself to do it. Instead he worked day after day, observing her silent, peaceful state. He had also realized that there would be no way he could convince her to carry on working after she realized that he'd killed billions of people because he was jealous of her love, so he left her and Gillian in suspension. Eventually, he fled, and Gillian and Jamie's bodies stayed in stasis for many years, so long that amnesia was a side effect, before they were discovered, setting the events of the game in motion.Elijah continued working on the snatchers, but could never perfect the skin. He knew his father could finish the job, so he sought his help. However, his father refused. This was no problem, as Elijah Modnar had discovered a \"kinetic being\" like a Snatcher, created by his father. He reveals that Random Hajile was this perfect robotic being, and by taking a sample of his skin, Elijah Modnar could perfect his snatchers and carry out his plans.The combat gridMetal Gear, strapped with explosives, appears at the scene. The delegates in Kyoto had agreed not to take action if this chapel was destroyed. In ten minutes, a blast would be sent destroying the chapel, which would qualify as Kyoto taking action. Multiple Snatchers appear to stop Jamie and Gillian's escape. Once more, Random Hajile comes to the rescue, though he was thought dead. He takes Elijah Modnar by the neck, and demands that the Snatchers stand down and let Jamie and Gillian escape. They agree, and the two escape just in time, right as the church is obliterated.The closing scene of Snatcher has Gillian and Jamie discussing their plans for the future. Gillian is preparing to take a short trip to Russia to try and regain his memory. He and Jamie plan to live together once again. Mika and Katrina come to wave him off and congratulate him on his successful mission. Mika reveals that the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad will remain intact, with a new Chief. As Gillian is about to leave, a newly fashioned Metal Gear arrives. Random dived upon him, saving him from the blast.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The first release of Snatcher was in 1988 for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2, both on floppy disks. In order for consistent sound, the MSX2 version included an audio cartridge. Both versions ended at Act 2. The PC Engine version added the 3rd Act in addition to improving graphics and sound thanks to the CD-ROM's expanded capabilities.The Sega CD was the first iteration to support any type of light gun, utilizing Sega's Justifier.Only acceptable if this girl is 18 years or older.Some of the main changes in the English localized version of Snatcher were the result of different censorship policies in each country. The American version saw Katrina's age changed from 14 to 18, due to a shower scene and Gillian's treatment of her. At one point in Japanese version, a bare breast was shown, and it was covered up in the English version. Certain animations were also cut, such as the twitching of decapitated corpses in the game. The English version also saw customers at Outer Heaven dressed as Konami characters, while the Japanese title had the guests dressed as sci-fi characters, a change made to avoid legal problems in the west. Another change to avoid legal problems was the appearance of the Snatchers themselves, who got an overhaul in appearance to tone down their originally deliberate resemblance to the Terminator. Gillian's eye colour is changed from brown to blue in the English SEGA CD version, most likely for aesthetic purposes.In addition, Act 3 was modified to make the playing experience more interactive. Act 3's introduction and ending cutscenes were also expanded.The murder of Alice the dog in the Japan-only PS1 release of Snatcher was changed to a more decent depiction when compared to the Sega CD version; while the Sega CD shows Alice's corpse from the front, her intestines leaking from her torso, the PS1 version shows her from behind, only showing a pool of blood. [CR]Connections to Other Games[CR]Snatcher is filled with references to other Konami titles.In the Japanese version of the game, the guests inside Outer Heaven were dressed as characters from famous science fiction franchises, but these were changed to Konami characters in the English release, including Goemon from The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Simon Belmont and Dracula from Castlevania, and Lance and Bill from Contra.The script was translated into English by Jerry Blaustein, who later translated Metal Gear Solid.The game's manual (English Sega CD) was done by Kevin O'Donohue, who did the manual for Metal Gear.There's a Moai Head mask in Napoleon's shop in reference to Konami's Gradius series shmup.The restaurant which Gillian visits for information multiple times is named Outer Heaven, the name of Big Boss's haven in the Metal Gear seriesGillian's navigator is Metal Gear Mk.II, inspired by the bipedal tanks which lend their namesake to the Metal Gear games. A non-sentient robot tool appears in Metal Gear Solid 4 as one of Solid Snake's pieces of equipment, also known as Metal Gear mk. II.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Snatcher was first composed by Kukeiha Club, Konami's in-house sound production team and published by King Records in 1989. It contains the MIDI sequenced soundtrack found on the MSX and PC-8801 versions of the game and features English narration throughout the album. The soundtrack for the Sega CD version was arranged by Kazuo Hashi and Yuzo Hayashi and features a more vibrant sound due to the Sega CD's cutting edge 32khz audio chip. It was released in 1992 as The Cyber Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks- and is the version most players will be familiar with.SnatcherSnatcherTotal length: 49:54AD 2042 Neo Kobe CityBio HazardTwilight of Neo Kobe CityEvil RippleTheme of SnatcherCreeping Silence ~Criminal Omen~ Danger Dance... and Justice AllInnocent GirlTheme of JaimeDecadence BeatThe Entrance To Hell ~ Theme of IzabelTheme of KatherineTheme of JunkerBlow Up TricycleSpreading Diehard ~ Eternal Promise (Goodbye Randam)Faded MemoriesRestoration ~ Pleasure of Tention ~ Endless PursuerBeyond SorrowsMaster of Puppets Among The DiseaseTheme of EndingSnatcher: The Syber Punk Adventure -Zoom Tracks-The Syber[sic] Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks-Total length: 44:32Bio HazardOne Night In Neo Kobe CityTwilight of Neo Kobe CityTheme of SNATCHER (Part 1)Theme of SNATCHER (Part 2)Theme of JamiePleasure of TensionFaded MemoriesEternal Promise (Good-Bye Randam)Beyond SorrowsTear-stained Eyes",

Gillian is shown around J.U.N.K.E.R. headquarters, where he meets Mika Slayton, the engineer Harry Benson, and the Chief Benson Cunningham. Gillian receives his blaster and his navigator, Metal Gear Mk.II. As soon as Gillian meets his partner, he receives a videophone call through Metal Gear from another J.U.N.K.E.R., Jean Jack Gibson. Jean Jack Gibson is in trouble, and needs help immediately. Gillian, though it is only his first day on the job, rushes off to complete his first task as a Junker. He rushes to the wreckage of an old building from which the call was made.Gillian with his blasterUpon arrival, the presence of an artificial pollen called Snow 9 is discovered, which is a sign of Snatcher presence. Gillian and Metal Gear go and explore the building, but all they find are the remains of Gibson's navigator, Little John, and Gibson's corpse. They discover that Gibson's head had been twisted off, something only a Snatcher would have the strength to do. They investigate to discover clues on both Gibson's corpse and Little John's memory bank. No Snatchers seem to be present, however, so the two move out to further investigate, hoping to identify the Snatcher that killed Gibson.Everyone at J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ is very hurt by the news that Jean Jack is dead, complicating the situation for Gillian. He consoles his comrades, and then moves forward in the investigation by searching Gibson's house. Gillian goes to Jean Jack's home, and speaks with his daughter, Katrina. While searching the home, he finds critical information regarding the identification of Snatchers. He learns that their artificial skin cannot cope with ultraviolet radiation, requiring them to operate at night, and use sunscreen at all times. As soon as he has this info, he moves out, hoping to utilize this to discover Gibson's murderer. Gillian also discovers an acquaintance of Jean Jack's, an informant codenamed \"Napoleon\". Napoleon provides information about Plato's Cavern and Outer Heaven, two places well known in the Neo-Kobe underground.Gillian's search leads him to a black market dealer and an underground restaurant, the only place in Neo Kobe that serves buffalo meat (which had been found in Gibson's stomach). He goes to this restaurant, Outer Heaven, and interrogates both the manager and one of the strippers. These interrogations give him a description of the man who must have killed Gibson, and Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ to use this description. The features described by the hooker at Outer Heaven lead Gillian to two suspects: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Gillian and Metal Gear first head to Rodriguez's apartment, located in a very rough area of town. When they get to his residence, Ivan comes out shooting. Gillian quickly disarms and interrogates him. Upon further investigation, evidence reveals that Ivan is not a Snatcher. All is not in vain, however, as Ivan is in possession of an illegal drug, explaining his actions, and he is later arrested by civilian police. Gillian now goes to find the other suspect, Freddy Nielsen.Gillian arrives at the Nielsen home only to discover Freddy isn't around. After questioning Nielsen's wife and searching for concrete evidence of Freddy's state, Gillian is attacked by his wife, who is a Snatcher. After killing her, Gillian and Metal Gear leave the scene, but as they do, a light comes on. They go back to figure out what happened, only to be attacked by Freddy Nielsen. Nielsen has Gillian by the neck, and Gillian seems helpless. Just before all hope is lost, a civilian bounty hunter, Random Hajile, saves Gillian.Act 2: CureGillian's first move in Act 2 is to find any information he can about the Snatchers' illicit hospital where they treat their skin. First, by searching the memory banks of Little John, an image of a neon sign that says 'Hospital Oleen' is discovered. For further information, Gillian seeks out Napoleon. Napoleon knows of an Oleen hospital, and provides Gillian with information on it for the right price. Gillian and Metal Gear rush to Oleen hospital, only to discover it is a veterinary clinic. Without bothering to investigate inside, they assume that the neon sign in the image from Little John must have been broken, and they need to find more clues.Benson's officeOnce the two finish speaking to Napoleon, they receive an urgent call concerning Katina Gibson. She had called in a panic earlier, requesting Gillian's help. Gillian immediately travels to her home, to find it torn apart. Gillian observes the scene, and finds evidence that it is a Snatcher's doing. When Gillian is just about to leave to find Katrina, Alice, the Gibsons' dog, is thrown through the window in a bloody mess. Hoping to find Katrina in one piece, Gillian and Metal Gear search for any place they may find her. When their search yields no results, they return to Gillian's apartment. Once the pair arrives at the apartment, they discover someone has been there.They enter cautiously and find that someone is using the bathroom. Slowly, they enter, and open the shower only to find Katrina, who quickly sprays Gillian in fright. Once she is decent, it is time for an explanation. Gillian questions Katrina, and she tells him why she came to his house, and what the Snatchers were doing in her home; She had found more clues. All three of them then attempt to figure out what was missing from Little John's image. They conclude that the Snatcher hospital is not \"Oleen\", rather, it is Queen's Hospital. With this newfound information, Gillian and Metal Gear head for their next destination.Upon arriving at Queen's Hospital, our heroes find a dark, abandoned building. It seems no one has been there for ages. The continue their investigation to find some interesting things in one of the rooms. They find a map of Russia, which is consistent with the Snatchers' strange obsession with Russia, and one piece of patient data left behind. The patient record is written in a complex form of Chinese, so the two need help to decode it. Once again, Gillian seeks the help of Napoleon.Gillian and Metal Gear find Napoleon at Outer Heaven. Luckily, Napoleon, a purebred Chinese man, knows the symbols on the patient record. It is a puzzle involving the periodic table. The group decodes the message, discovering the patient's name is 'Benson.' Shocked, Gillian rushes off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ; there are only two Bensons he knows of. Unfortunately, neither the Chief nor Harry are at HQ. Gillian thoroughly searches the building for any clue, and finds a message from Harry. \"Face to Face\" is all that he left for them. Gillian further searches, realizing what this clue means. It refers to a painting in the Chief's office, an optical illusion, which shows both a vase and two faces. Gillian investigates, and discovers an image of Red Square in Moscow behind the painting. Believing that the Chief is probably a Snatcher, they leave to try and track him down. As they are leaving, they receive a videophone call from Gillian's wife, Jamie Seed. She has somehow discovered that Queen's Hospital installed a basement. This must be where they are operating from! Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to the hospital.All does not go as planned, however. As soon as they begin driving the turbocycle, they discover it has been sabotaged. Gillian constantly struggles to find a way to stop the vehicle, but to no avail. Once again, Random Hajile comes to the rescue just before Gillian meets his end. Random joins the two, and they head to the hospital.Once they arrive, they immediately search for and find the secret basement. They search all around, and eventually come across the Snatchers' morgue, containing four Human corpses. Metal Gear analyzes the bodies, to identify them and find out if the Snatchers had assumed their identities. The first two bodies are the Nielsens, the second is Chin Shu Oh, who once ran the hospital... and the third to Chief Benson Cunningham. With this new discovery, the three attempt to leave, only to encounter Chin Shu Oh and other Snatchers. All hope seems lost, but Random has one last trick up his sleeve. He tells Gillian to escape through a nearby ventilation shaft, and he uses explosives attached to himself to take down the building in a suicide attack.After the explosion, Gillian and Metal Gear find themselves in a long shaft, and observe that it was likely used by Snatchers to travel. They go further down to find it connects to an abandoned subway rail, which the Snatchers must have used to get around. They walk through the Snatcher Underground Railroad, looking for an exit. They eventually come across a ladder, which appears to take them out. They use this ladder, only to end up in the Nielsens home. They conclude this must have been how Freddy Nielsen entered the home without being noticed to attack Gillian. They had to get back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ immediately, and leave.NapoleonTo get back to HQ, Gillian calls up a taxi. When Gillian requests he be taken to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ, the driver acts strangely. It turns out that the driver is actually Chin Shu Oh, and Gillian takes him out. Once that is over, they rush off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ in the comandeered taxi.When Gillian arrives, he finds that someone has attacked HQ. Mika has been locked into her pod, and Metal Gear attempts to open it. Once open, they find Mika unconscious. They revive her, and she tells them that Harry ran in after Chief Cunningham, and locked the door behind. She allows them to go inside, and they dash inside to help Harry. Gillian and Metal Gear find Harry laying in a pool of his own blood. Harry tells them how he discovered that the Chief was a Snatcher, but was no match for the murderous robot. Harry then dies in Gillian's arms. Enraged, Gillian is determined to get revenge for Harry's death. Once again, he searches HQ. Gillian finds the Chief clinging to the ceiling of his office, and kills him.Act 3: JunkAct 3 begins with Gillian, Metal Gear, and Mika going over all that has happened up to that point. They discuss the Snatchers' weaknesses, those who have been discovered to be Snatchers, and the mysterious information that has been gathered. Upon studying all they know, they notice some actual links between the Snatchers and Russia, the country they're so obsessed with. It seems the Snatchers all consider this place their home.At this time, Metal Gear reveals that he actually knows all about Gillian and his mysterious past. Gillian and his wife Jamie were found cryogenically frozen in a Russian facility near the spot where the Catastrophe, a nuclear attack that devastated all of Europe, had occurred. There was one other pod, but it was empty. Jamie and Gillian both had amnesia as a result of the cryogenic suspension, and knew nothing. After inexplicably moving to Japan, Gillian joined the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad hoping it would help him recover their lost memories. Gillian also discovers that Harry Benson was he and Jamie's fully grown son.Shocking revelationsThe three decide to find the place that the Snatchers are gathered in Neo-Kobe. The conclude it must be in an area near a river from which Snow 9 originates, and a place easily accessible through the subway tunnels. All signs point to the Snatchers hiding in an old abandoned chapel, which somehow seems to line up with the Moscow river. Gillian, deciding this must be the secret hideout of the Snatchers, rushes to the scene.Unfortunately for the J.U.N.K.E.R.s, time is short. The Kyoto Summit discussing the Snatcher problem is getting together, and in approximately three hours, all authority J.U.N.K.E.R. has will be dissolved. They would also vote whether or not to completely destroy Neo-Kobe with nuclear weapons to end the Snatcher threat once and for all. Gillian must work quickly.Once Gillian and Metal Gear arrive, they find the church empty. The enter, and see a portrait of a man called \"Modnar,\" who is clearly Random Hajile. They go further in, and find the snatchers being prepared to act as humans. They find data planning to snatch and replace many major world leaders and Gillian himself. With little time left, Metal Gear psychotically reveals that if ordered to by Kyoto, he will murder Gillian. Gillian asks Metal Gear to go out and attempt to convince the delegates in Kyoto to give him more time. Metal Gear agrees, and leaves Gillian to continue by himself.Gillian moves on, and encounters numerous Snatchers. He kills them and moves into the final chamber, where he finds Jamie, who explains how she was captured and taken to work on the development of a perfect artificial skin for the Snatchers with Dr. Modnar. Dr. Modnar was well past 100 years of age, however, and had passed on minutes before Gillian's arrival. Jamie cries about how she did it because they threatened to take their son's life, and Gillian tells her how their son, Harry, was already murdered by the Snatchers.Taking out a SnatcherAnother man reveals himself at this point. An old man in a wheelchair, Dr. Elijah Modnar. He had captured is father, the elder Dr. Modnar, to perfect his snatchers. He describes to Jamie and Gillian how he was recruited long ago to work on this project with them to simulate humans. The Snatchers were intended as a means of taking power over all other nations, the ultimate weapon. He worked on the team with Jamie, and fell in love with her. At one point in time, his only motivation to work was his love for her. Later, Gillian was hired to work with the psychological properties of the Snatchers. Jamie and Gillian fell in love and were married. Elijah was furious at this, and plotted to end it all. He set off the massive weapon Lucifer Alpha, creating the Catastrophe, and had Gillian and Jamie join him in cryogenic freezing. His plan was to leave Gillian frozen, and awaken Jamie so they could live together in peace. When he final woke up, however, he could not bring himself to do it. Instead he worked day after day, observing her silent, peaceful state. He had also realized that there would be no way he could convince her to carry on working after she realized that he'd killed billions of people because he was jealous of her love, so he left her and Gillian in suspension. Eventually, he fled, and Gillian and Jamie's bodies stayed in stasis for many years, so long that amnesia was a side effect, before they were discovered, setting the events of the game in motion.Elijah continued working on the snatchers, but could never perfect the skin. He knew his father could finish the job, so he sought his help. However, his father refused. This was no problem, as Elijah Modnar had discovered a \"kinetic being\" like a Snatcher, created by his father. He reveals that Random Hajile was this perfect robotic being, and by taking a sample of his skin, Elijah Modnar could perfect his snatchers and carry out his plans.The combat gridMetal Gear, strapped with explosives, appears at the scene. The delegates in Kyoto had agreed not to take action if this chapel was destroyed. In ten minutes, a blast would be sent destroying the chapel, which would qualify as Kyoto taking action. Multiple Snatchers appear to stop Jamie and Gillian's escape. Once more, Random Hajile comes to the rescue, though he was thought dead. He takes Elijah Modnar by the neck, and demands that the Snatchers stand down and let Jamie and Gillian escape. They agree, and the two escape just in time, right as the church is obliterated.The closing scene of Snatcher has Gillian and Jamie discussing their plans for the future. Gillian is preparing to take a short trip to Russia to try and regain his memory. He and Jamie plan to live together once again. Mika and Katrina come to wave him off and congratulate him on his successful mission. Mika reveals that the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad will remain intact, with a new Chief. As Gillian is about to leave, a newly fashioned Metal Gear arrives. Random dived upon him, saving him from the blast.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The first release of Snatcher was in 1988 for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2, both on floppy disks. In order for consistent sound, the MSX2 version included an audio cartridge. Both versions ended at Act 2. The PC Engine version added the 3rd Act in addition to improving graphics and sound thanks to the CD-ROM's expanded capabilities.The Sega CD was the first iteration to support any type of light gun, utilizing Sega's Justifier.Only acceptable if this girl is 18 years or older.Some of the main changes in the English localized version of Snatcher were the result of different censorship policies in each country. The American version saw Katrina's age changed from 14 to 18, due to a shower scene and Gillian's treatment of her. At one point in Japanese version, a bare breast was shown, and it was covered up in the English version. Certain animations were also cut, such as the twitching of decapitated corpses in the game. The English version also saw customers at Outer Heaven dressed as Konami characters, while the Japanese title had the guests dressed as sci-fi characters, a change made to avoid legal problems in the west. Another change to avoid legal problems was the appearance of the Snatchers themselves, who got an overhaul in appearance to tone down their originally deliberate resemblance to the Terminator. Gillian's eye colour is changed from brown to blue in the English SEGA CD version, most likely for aesthetic purposes.In addition, Act 3 was modified to make the playing experience more interactive. Act 3's introduction and ending cutscenes were also expanded.The murder of Alice the dog in the Japan-only PS1 release of Snatcher was changed to a more decent depiction when compared to the Sega CD version; while the Sega CD shows Alice's corpse from the front, her intestines leaking from her torso, the PS1 version shows her from behind, only showing a pool of blood. [CR]Connections to Other Games[CR]Snatcher is filled with references to other Konami titles.In the Japanese version of the game, the guests inside Outer Heaven were dressed as characters from famous science fiction franchises, but these were changed to Konami characters in the English release, including Goemon from The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Simon Belmont and Dracula from Castlevania, and Lance and Bill from Contra.The script was translated into English by Jerry Blaustein, who later translated Metal Gear Solid.The game's manual (English Sega CD) was done by Kevin O'Donohue, who did the manual for Metal Gear.There's a Moai Head mask in Napoleon's shop in reference to Konami's Gradius series shmup.The restaurant which Gillian visits for information multiple times is named Outer Heaven, the name of Big Boss's haven in the Metal Gear seriesGillian's navigator is Metal Gear Mk.II, inspired by the bipedal tanks which lend their namesake to the Metal Gear games. A non-sentient robot tool appears in Metal Gear Solid 4 as one of Solid Snake's pieces of equipment, also known as Metal Gear mk. II.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Snatcher was first composed by Kukeiha Club, Konami's in-house sound production team and published by King Records in 1989. It contains the MIDI sequenced soundtrack found on the MSX and PC-8801 versions of the game and features English narration throughout the album. The soundtrack for the Sega CD version was arranged by Kazuo Hashi and Yuzo Hayashi and features a more vibrant sound due to the Sega CD's cutting edge 32khz audio chip. It was released in 1992 as The Cyber Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks- and is the version most players will be familiar with.SnatcherSnatcherTotal length: 49:54AD 2042 Neo Kobe CityBio HazardTwilight of Neo Kobe CityEvil RippleTheme of SnatcherCreeping Silence ~Criminal Omen~ Danger Dance... and Justice AllInnocent GirlTheme of JaimeDecadence BeatThe Entrance To Hell ~ Theme of IzabelTheme of KatherineTheme of JunkerBlow Up TricycleSpreading Diehard ~ Eternal Promise (Goodbye Randam)Faded MemoriesRestoration ~ Pleasure of Tention ~ Endless PursuerBeyond SorrowsMaster of Puppets Among The DiseaseTheme of EndingSnatcher: The Syber Punk Adventure -Zoom Tracks-The Syber[sic] Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks-Total length: 44:32Bio HazardOne Night In Neo Kobe CityTwilight of Neo Kobe CityTheme of SNATCHER (Part 1)Theme of SNATCHER (Part 2)Theme of JamiePleasure of TensionFaded MemoriesEternal Promise (Good-Bye Randam)Beyond SorrowsTear-stained Eyes",

Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.[CR]The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.",

Very soon he realizes that the bounty Jane has been hunting for is his own head, for which the Galaxy Patrol has put quite a reward. But everything changes when Crystal Boy, the head of the Pirate Guild and Cobra's archenemy, appears on the scene. Jane's father had apparently hidden a great treasure, encoding its location in tattoos on the backs of his triplet daughters. Crystal Boy wants this treasure, and is going after Jane and her sisters. Cobra and Jane decide to join forces in order to find Jane's sisters and to undermine Crystal Boy's plans.[CR]The game is a Japanese-style adventure. You advance in the game by choosing various commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc.). There are a few places in the game where you can die if you make a wrong decision.

The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.[CR]The Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. [CR]The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional \"cosmic versus\" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the \"omake mode\", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.[CR]The WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black and white) but keeps the versus mode.",

[CR]Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the \"Grandmaster\" rules over the world. Hiryu, the youngest ever Super A Ranked[2] member of a organization of high-tech ninja-like agents known as the \"Striders\", is alone tasked with the Grandmaster's assassination. Hiryu begins his mission by infiltrating the Grandmaster's capital at the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. [CR]NEC Avenue produced a PC Engine version of Strider Hiryu, which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994. The PC Engine version was released as a CD-ROM2 title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. The PC Engine port features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor Kaneto Shiozawa as the voice of Hiryu and Koji Totani as the Grand Master.

The characters are taken from other Laser Soft games, most prominently Cosmic Fantasy series. The amount of moves is determined by dice roll.

There is also a story mode split into two episodes (both based on sci-fi-themed futuristic scenarios); however, there is no actual plot development in-game, and the episodes are very short compared to standard-length shooters.[CR]Like in most games of the kind, the player controls a spaceship and tries to eliminate or avoid on-screen enemies. Power-ups take the shape of the letters A, B, C, and D; each corresponds to a weapon of specific color and properties (e.g. spreading fire, side fire, etc.), though they are fairly similar to each other in function.

There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.[CR]The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.[CR]Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.",

The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.[CR]The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.[CR]Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.",

                "plot": "Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.[CR]The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.",

Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.[CR]Like the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.",

The player controls a small party at first, but later can command several units. Most of the gameplay takes place on the battle fields. The player navigates the heroes in turn-based fashion, attacking or casting magic when the enemy is in range. Attacks are presented as short full-screen animated sequences. Characters gain experience after each attack and might level up in the middle of the battle.[CR]Unlike many other games of this kind, Sword Master contains an additional RPG element in the possibility to navigate the characters in real time in towns and other \"friendly\" areas.

The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level). Sylphia consists of eight stages and is single player only.",

The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability.

Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.[CR]Navigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.[CR]Fields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them. Should two player-controlled parties meet each other on the same field, they can opt to fight each other.",

Weather conditions (normal, rain, or snow) and match length can be selected as well. The game itself is played from a third-person perspective that slightly switches between isometric and top-down depending on the situation.",

After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...[CR]The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.",

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. [CR]Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.[CR]The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called \"tactics\" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.[CR]Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.",

In the end of the 22nd century, Gamila aliens bombard Earth with radioactive meteorites. As a result, the planet's surface becomes uninhabitable, and humans begin to dwell underground. Using the ruins of the World War II Japanese battleship Yamato, humans construct a powerful spaceship and can finally engage the aliens in direct confrontation.[CR]This incarnation of the series is essentially a real-time strategy game with a somewhat unusual approach to the genre. Rather than navigating units on battlefields, the player takes direct control of every crew member onboard the ship. Each one of them is responsible for a certain function (supplying power, manning a gun, turning the ship, etc.); in order to win battles, it is crucial to coordinate their actions. The game proceeds in real time, but pauses when the player accesses crew members and performs actions for them.",

Yuuko's life seems peaceful but, meanwhile, the Dark world starts to get menaced to become disappeared in the void. So Its king, Glames, decides to take other worlds by force in order to keep the inhabitants from his world alive. But some of the dark world people oppose to the idea of using the force to take the worlds, so Glames starts to dispose them. As a consequence, a girl from the resistance of such world, Cham, decides to go to the human world and search for the Valis sword to use It against Glames who, in turn, posseses the counterpart of the Valis sword, the Leethus sword. After taking the sword, Cham tries to go back to the dark world but Yuuko stops her to find out why she wants her sword only to see the girl kidnapped by one of Glames's generals. After Yuuko beats him, Cham is freed an tells the Valis warrior about the situation and that Vanity is being invaded by Glames's army. Without wasting time, Yuuko and Cham make their ways to the dream world to see It in chaos due to the dark king's intromission as they find out that Valna has been also kidnapped by other of the generals. The heroines make their way to Valna and freed her. She then fights and beats her captor, then she says Yuuko to go to the temple where the widsom man, Nizetti, can give her the Valis armor's ultimate form unleashing all of Valis sword's power. Meanwhile, a strange figure allies with Glames. The three girls go there passing terrible tests and obstacles finally meeting with Nizetti who warns them that although having the sword's full power, Yuuko maybe won't win against Glames, but aside of all negative pronostics, she still decides to use the power. After doing so, they make their way to the dark world to confront Glames, not before getting onto the death world to find an awful surprise, the figure that allied with Glames reveals itself as Rogles, the antagonist from the first game who was supposed to be dead. He fights Yuuko and gets deffeated once again by her. The way continues as the protagonist fight Zalude and Asura. After his defeat, Asura reports them that Glames isn't on the dark world anymore and that he made his way into the human world showing that his generals were only making time for him to approach there.

In the end, Glames expresses his last will to his opponents to maintain alive the dark world's inhabitants and to guard the Leethus sword, he dies minutes later.

This game's events happen 15 years after those of Valis III and introduce a new protagonist: Lena Brande.[CR]Story[CR]Hundreds of years ago, the king Asfal from the Dark World had a son, Galgear, who was driven insane by the power of a ring that he inherited from his father, causing wars and widespread destruction in order to make that power grow constantly.[CR]Consequently, the gods imprisoned Galgear and his followers in a giant crystal and sank it under the seas.[CR]Many centuries have passed and the crystal emerges to the surface once again with Galgear and his army broken free, bringing an end to the short-lived era of peace enjoyed by Vecanti after Glames' defeat in Valis III.[CR]With his reign of chaos reestablished, Glames takes over Vecanti and starts to take over the human world also. Galgear then kidnaps Vecanti's current queen, Valna, and prepares her execution.[CR]Meanwhile, a resistance force in the dream world led by Cham tries to fight Galgear's regime but this seems to be useless. Lena, a member of the resistance, decides to rescue Valna along with her sister Amu. Although Cham isn't in accordance with her, she hears Yuuko's voice telling her to let Lena go. Having no other option, Cham teaches them some basic things and then stays behind in Vecanti guarding the city and the survivors.[CR]Lena and Amu manage to infiltrate Castle Vanity and defeat the first of Galgear's generals, Dhalgen. Then they find Valna and try to rescue her just to be stopped and injured by Galgear himself, meeting him personally for the first time. Just as he is going to deal the heroines the final blow, they are teleported away by a stranger who reveals himself to be Asfal, Galgear's father himself, who also wants to stop his son's evil regime. He tells Lena that the only thing that can defeat his son is the Valis sword, which isn't in this world anymore, and that they have to reach Valhalla in the sky in order to obtain It from Yuuko, the most recent Valis warrior and current guardian of the sword.[CR]After overcoming many obstacles, they meet Yuuko who warns Lena about the things she will have to live as a Valis warrior by showing her memories and asks if she still wants to become a Valis warrior. Lena answers decidedly that she will accept that destiny if she can save the three worlds from Galgear. Yuuko then tests her with satisfactory results and gives her the Valis sword and thus the Valis armor.[CR]Afterward, the three protagonists make their way into the human world to reach the giant crystal Galgear uses as his base. After beating many of his henchmen and his last two generals, they find Galgear trying to kill Valna once again. It seems to be too late to save her, but Amu steps in front of Galgear's axe throw, saving Valna's life but being mortally injured.[CR]Asfal releases Valna and holds off his son while Amu dies in her sister's arms. Lena then addresses Galgear, saying that she will put an end to him once and for all. Galgear challenges her to come and fight him in his lair, the red moon, where Asfal lived when he was king.[CR]Lena and Asfal open a path to the red moon where they fight Galgear, defeating him sucessfully. Asfal and Galgear apologize to each other respectively for all that has happened, after which Galgear dies in the arms of his father. Lena then goes to Amu's grave to pay her last respects and starts to walk toward the horizon, asking herself what will await in the future.",

                "plot": "Vasteel 2 is formally a sequel to Vasteel; it is also set in the eponymous fictional, futuristic solar system and deals primarily with strategic battles between robots. However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.[CR]The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.[CR]The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.",

The player manages the life of the young girl with a specific goal in mind, which must be chosen from the main menu. The girl can strive to become a singer, a photo model, a school teacher, etc. The player then tries to alter her statistics accordingly to achieve the goal.[CR]The main activities on work days are divided into three groups: training, working, and learning. The learning category is the smallest one, but is also necessary for continuing the girl's normal school life. Training includes singing, arts, body building, sports, etc. Part-time jobs such as waitress, cook, private tutor, and even construction worker are available; the pay varies greatly, but so are the changes in parameters.[CR]On holidays, the girl is able to venture outside and explore the top-down city, which contains various shops, boutiques, offices, etc. Clothes and other accessories can be purchased. It is also possible to talk and bond with other girls, potential rivals, who live in the same dormitory. All this influences the heroine's parameters, for good and for bad.",

Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this a remake.[CR]Unlike the computer originals with their vector lines, the dungeons have simple graphics now. Enemy sprites are also drawn in a more detailed fashion. A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names (\"Fighter\", \"Samurai\", etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of Might and Magic), however, remains possible. Naturally, in The Return of Werdna the player controls Werdna himself and his summoned monsters.

Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the \"Maelstrom\" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.[CR]Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.[CR]The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.",

During a trip to Kyoto she attends a party and witnesses a mysterious murder of a wealthy man's estranged wife. Yoko decides to stay and help the authorities investigate the crime.[CR]The game plays like a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure. Most of the time the player chooses a location to travel to and interrogates characters, selecting various topics from a list. Such scenes are presented in first-person view. A few segments, however, feature third-person navigation with point-and-click interaction, similar to Western adventures. Other instances require the player to move a cursor on a zoomed object to interact with it in a detailed way.",

The visual style of the game is also quite different, with bright anime-like graphics atypical of the previous entries.[CR]Gameplay-wise, this installment also differs from the preceding computer games by greatly reducing interaction. All of the dialogue in the game is spoken, and much of the narration is revealed through Miyu's thoughts which act like cutscenes, rather than being derived from interaction with the environment. In essence, the game is a fairly linear visual novel with some occasions where the player is able to visit different locations.",

As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.[CR]The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.[CR]Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.",

Choosing a region of Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc.[CR]Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.",

His feelings hurt, the youth ventures to the United States, trying to earn enough money and participate in races to defend his national pride.The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).",
