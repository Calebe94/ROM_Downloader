Even though that's ancient compared to todays systems, everyone acknowledges that the original PlayStation was an important and well-supported console.[CR][CR]Whether the PlayStation was pumping out beautiful sprites or 3D polygons, the experiences it made possible are some of gaming's greatest. These 50 titles capture the PS1's spirit of new and exciting frontiers - and even after all these years, they still (mostly) hold up thanks to their exemplary gameplay.

Somehow, some way, we have to concoct a method to kill his guy with no trace of our involvement. How the hell are we going to do that?[CR][CR]This is the beauty of Syphon Filter. There are more out-of-the-box moments like this here than in most other games we've played. Scenes like the one above kept us wondering how the game would challenge us next, inducing the \"just one more mission\" feeling that raise games to higher echelons of quality.

The mechanic was abandoned in NFS2, but EA decided to make it the main focus of the third title, and a new classic was born.[CR][CR]Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit gave us a whole new perspective on adrenaline: Racing at top speeds was enough, but now fleeing for our freedom from the oppressive police military complex? That was a feeling sorely missed in the second Need for Speed game. It also allowed us to live out our reckless, seat-of-our-pants criminal fantasies without actually doing anything illegal, and for that we will always be thankful.",

One failed mission could result in us viewing the worst ending in the game, and we had to pick up and start all over again just to see an improved outcome. We didn't know what missions were more important than others, so all we could do is try and pass them all. Sure, our gaming rooms ended up looking like Swiss cheese, but it was totally worth it.",

Enemies and allies both had personality, and responded in different ways to specific stimuli as opposed to just predictably walking left or right.

The Materia-based battle system still influences game design today, the story features one of the most tragic plot twists of all time, and the graphics (at the time) were beyond anything we'd ever seen. FF7 was a revolution, and everyone else just had to catch up.",

But that doesn\u2019t mean that it was something to pass on--far from it, actually. It told a memorable story and the gameplay rivaled that of any classic RPG. But the standout feature involved what happened when you weren\u2019t in control.[CR][CR]Instead of CGI cutscenes, fully animated cartoon sequences drove the narrative forward in between battle and exploration. This simple idea gave all the characters more depth and relatability than was normally seen in an RPG, and allowed players to more easily invest themselves in the story. It also didn\u2019t hurt that the English localization and voice acting were top-notch.",

And for some reason, we absolutely loved it for that.[CR][CR]With its dense fog, smothering darkness, and multiple dimensions, Silent Hill created one of the most terrifying yet memorable environments ever seen in a video game. Even more unsettling was that the game\u2019s protagonist, Harry Mason, wasn\u2019t some chain-smoking space marine: He was a normal dude who sucked at fighting. Whether this was an excuse for a poor control scheme or an intentional combat deterrent, we certainly gained a new appreciation for the term survival. Running away is exactly what you would do if being chased by deadly monsters, and we\u2019ll always appreciate Konami\u2019s understanding of this idea. Also, an alien abduction ending was possible. Too cool.",

By the end of the smartly evolving story, we were so emotionally invested in the cast and thoroughly satisfied by the old-school, non-convoluted combat system that we couldn\u2019t help but hold FF9 above both of its console brethren.

Anyone who\u2019s spent an hour with their party in a circle formation boosting xp by chucking stones at each other understands the sense of accomplishment to be had from mastering one of the games 20 job classes.[CR][CR]But it wasn\u2019t all about experience points and hit percentages. The world of Ivalice was as visually stunning as an isometric, grid-based world could get, and the mature approach to storytelling was a perfect match for the gameplay. Granted, we couldn\u2019t really understand some of the nonsensical translation until it was redone for the 2007 War of the Lions remake, but the groundwork was there. Oh yeah, and the soundtrack contains some of our favorite video game music ever.",

Go in guns blazing (well, as close as you could get to guns blazing in MGS) and you were met with swift, crushing defeat. Why did we ever put up with it?[CR][CR]Because not only did MGS deliver a thrilling interactive experience, it was the next evolution in gaming. Its movie-like cutscenes and meticulously designed, stealth-centric levels were evidence of a production value not normally seen in a video game.

And now we have a problem.[CR][CR]The expansive map, RPG elements, unlockable skills, and (enjoyable) backtracking of SOTN led to the coinage of the term Metroidvania to describe similar games. And, thanks to Konami focusing on using the PS\u2019s power to amplify the 2D graphics instead of delving into the trendy territory of early 3D gaming, SOTN holds up extremely well. So much so, it\u2019s considered one of the best games of not only the PS era, but of all time.",
