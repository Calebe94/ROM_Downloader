As a 16-bit system, it meant sharper resolution, bigger characters, more complex animations, and digitally sampled audio. The graphics began to approach cartoon-like quality, allowing developers to design large casts of recognizable characters. Released in 1989 with the slogan \"Genesis does what Nintendon't\", it was consistently neck and neck with its biggest competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[CR]If you missed out on these classics, or just want an old-school nostalgia fest, you can find many of them on the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3, or on many downloadable services out there. Now, allow us to present our list of the 50 best Sega Genesis games of all time...",

But before that came OutRun.[CR]You and an anonymous blonde co-pilot took on all challengers in your blood-red Ferrari Testarossa. Well, it's not an officially-licensed Ferrari Testarossa, but you can clearly see the prancing horse on the back. Originally released in arcades, the game uses clever 2D trickery to simulate hills and dips in the road. Dubbed 'the beautiful journey' by its fans, OutRun is a lovely, lovely thing and this Mega Drive port is the closest any of the contemporary home ports came to replicating that astonishing arcade original.",

Well, except Japan. The blood was green there.[CR]Controversy abounded in MK2\u2019s wake. Parents protested, politicians filibustered, and the game was even banned for a while in Germany. That didn\u2019t stop it from becoming one of the fastest-selling Genesis games in 1994. In fact, it probably helped.",

The company\u2019s stripped-down take on NBA two-on-two \"jam\" play put the emphasis on fast-turnaround arcade play; so when Acclaim brought the hit to home consoles, the biggest change was the omission of those pesky quarterly 'Insert Coin' prompts.[CR]Pretty much everything else remained intact: the sizeable real-life roster; the furious two-on-two, drop-in-drop-out play; and the backboard-smashing theatrics that had drawn arcade crowds. A later Tournament Edition update further increased the roster--and added some of gaming\u2019s most legendary Easter eggs, including the option to play as then-Commander-in-Chief William Jefferson Clinton.",

Amazingly, there's a separate quest for each character, plus another for the pair in co-op, with only a few areas shared.

Sure, even back in the Genesis days, licensed games were a mixed bunch, but Aladdin bucked the trend to create a platformer of astonishing quality--and one that remains exclusive to the Sega machine. It even had clever gameplay references to lines in the movie: You could hop on the backs of camels and watch them spit![CR]Not only was Sega's Aladdin a fast-paced romp, the graphics and sounds captured the look and music of the movie in exquisite fashion, unlike the comparatively poor SNES game of the same name. Sadly it was too early in gaming's life to have Robin Williams record a voice track, but everything else was spot-on. And the game world is so detailed, a guard's knife can split one of Aladdin's apples in half in mid-air. Just too good.",

It was a more realistic take on hockey; you could now shoot directly off a pass (dubbed a 'one-timer'), which still feels amazing when it flies into the top corner of the net.

The combination of hand-drawn pixel art and skull-crushing violence somehow manages to make the game charming instead of alarming. And this art style has aged much better than the supposedly more realistic digitised characters of Road Rash 3.[CR]There are additions to the formula, such as a chain to swing at your rivals (alongside the return of the big black club of the original), nitrous boosts for the faster bikes and a split-screen two-player mode that really pushed the hardware to its limit. But the best enhancement is the added fallibility of the police. Unlike the original's invincible fuzz, you can knock O'Learly and his cronies off their bikes and zoom away for the win unchallenged.

Wow.[CR]Like so many of AM#2's arcade games, it stands up as a great game despite the now painfully restrictive colour palette, polygon count and frame rate. Somehow it's still an absolute blast to play. It's fast, controls as well as the digital input will allow and offers substantial replay value in terms of time attack fun. There's even a 2-player split screen mode, which is clearly stretching the hardware's abilities to breaking point. But do it, it does. It deserves to be played, but just don't do it on a big screen.

Yes, the game came presaged by a marketing blitz representing the full weight of the Sega hype factory at the height of its powers, but it had the substance to justify it too.[CR]This is a game built around the thrill of movement, the exhilaration of discovering new areas--and the challenge of developing reactions as fast as our hero\u2019s iconic red footwear. The levels reward any kind of approach, whether that's hunting out every last ring or just blazing through as quickly as you can. New to Sonic? Do yourself a favor and start all the way back here. You\u2019ll be up to speed before you know it.",

Solo play is bolstered with a groundbreaking ghost mode time attack (that saves ghosts to memory), but it's multiplayer that steals the show, supporting up to support EIGHT PLAYERS by sharing four pads, two of which are plugged directly into the cartridge thanks to Codemasters' J-Cart.

That all got scrapped when that particular piece of hardware failed to take off, and instead gamers got one of the greatest RPGs of all time. No loss there, then.[CR]At the time of its launch, it was a uniquely anime-inspired RPG. The game\u2019s dense story, told with manga-style panels, made it stand out amongst other top down, turn-based fare. Sadly, it was to be the final entry of the original Phantasy Star series, but what a fine send-off it was. After the previous installment dabbled in a medieval setting, IV brought the series back to its sci-fi roots to conclude the story of the Algol system. Sega will be hard-pushed to ever make an RPG better than this one.",

And despite its age, the old excitement still swells inside when Ryu appears in that famous intro sequence and throws a Hadoken fireball at the screen. Goosebumps time!",

Younger siblings everywhere were suddenly useful![CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 also introduced pseudo-3D bonus levels where you could earn Chaos Emeralds. Collecting all seven let you become Super Sonic, a turbocharged yellow version of the hero. So, essentially super-saiyan Sonic. Subsequent Sonic games all tried to augment the experience, but invariably ended up diluting what made Sonic 2 so great. What a game.",

The result is a game that looks, sounds and feels sensational.[CR]Yuzo Koshiro's soundtrack is a masterpiece--something that was rarely mentioned at the time as everyone focused on timing their pipe swings to connect perfectly with the thugs' faces. Weapons include knives, Samurai swords and grenades... by rights, it should be a gorefest, but the reality is much more dignified. Quality oozes from every pixel, fun from every co-op ruckus and technical prowess from every frame. Streets of Rage II never ages, but we do, allowing us to appreciate its artistry beyond how fun it is to smash up a bunch of 1990s-sterotyped punks. Streets of Rage 3 couldn't replicate the magic, leaving us with this as the pinnacle of 16-bit Sega gaming.",
