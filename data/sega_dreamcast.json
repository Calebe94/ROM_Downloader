Filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR]The Dreamcast is a 128-bit video game console which was released by Sega in late 1998 in Japan and from September 1999 in other territories. It was the first entry in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube. Dreamcast sales were positive during launch, but because of the strong pressure from rival PlayStation 2, Dreamcast sales decreased, and Sega finally discontinued the Dreamcast in March 2001 and withdrew entirely from the console hardware business, making it the company's final console.[CR]Developer:  Sega[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]CPU:  200 MHz Hitachi SH4 RISC[CR]Memory:  RAM 16 MB, GPU 8 MB[CR]Graphics:  100 MHz PowerVR2 CLX2[CR]Sound:  Yamaha AICA Sound Processor with a 32-Bit ARM7 RISC CPU[CR]Display:  640 x 480[CR]Media:  Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  4",

In 2001, the Dreamcast release brought changes for the game's characters, voice actors, as well as its implementation of a more accessible/user-friendly in-game map. While it was well-received on SEGA's hardware, the later ports were criticized for not making good use of slightly more powerful hardware and not providing any additional value to the source material. The game's sequel,The King of Route 66, was exclusively released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of 18 Wheeler consists of you racing another trucker across and the clock across the country carrying cargo. Arcade ModeRequires you to deliver various cargo across truncated representations of the continental United States. The objective is to beat your rival and deliver your cargo with as little damage as possible.  Arcade Courses: New York - Key WestSt. Petersberg - DallasDallas - Las VegasLas Vegas - San FransiscoParking ModeParking Mode consists of six challenges which task players to accurately park their semi-trucks within the perimeters of a highlighted area \u00e0 laCrazy Taxi. There were three bonus stages (parking levels) featured in the arcade version, which were placed in-between the levels, although the number is increased to six - including two that have to be unlocked, in the console ports. The purpose of the parking levels is to earn upgrades for your semi-truck, making the later arcade levels more manageable, and additionally put an emphasis on precision control and careful driving techniques. Parking Courses (Arcade): One-Turn Parking - Unlocks louder horn.Two-Turn Parking - Unlocks muffler.Reverse Parking - Unlocks new truck engine.Versus ModeTwo player mode where you race head to head to deliver your cargo.Score Attack ModeIn this mode your goal is to earn as much money as possible while racing three laps around a course.

And the whole game has a simplistic, fun, arcade racer feel.   The indoor circuit offers six levels, and the outdoor circuit offers ten. At the outset, there are only eight stock vehicles available, ranging from monster trucks to quads. If you are successful in the championship mode, you can unlock secret cars and upgraded versions of the game's stock vehicles.    Early tracks are mostly circular, with an ample number of curves and hairpins. Later levels feature a multitude of forks and shortcuts.    The game itself plays like other similar racers: constant acceleration, bouncy handling, and lots of level shortcuts. As with Hydro Thunder boost comes in two flavors; red and blue. The red boost icons give you 9 seconds of boost, whilst the blue icons give 4 seconds of precious boost. You can also play each of 4 Wheel Thunder's main activities with a friend also there are four play modes for two-player combat: bomb, bomb race, balloon, and tag battle.   Upon release, the game was blasted for it's punishing difficulty. The retail release however toned down the challenge to a reasonable level (that is if you raced almost perfectly) and made it possible to unlock all the tracks and vehicles. Early in development, the game was known as Xceleration.[CR]",

In addition to those modes, the game features training in  over 30 fighter training missions and 15 tactical challenges. Successful completion of these challenges will unlock additional fighters (including the XF-3 Super Recipro, F-2B Support Fighter or F-15DJ Aggressor 2 to name a few) and decals/paint for the plane models.

Due to the ethnic tension, neighbors began drawing boundaries according to religious faith. However, Zabayral never maintained an army, instead the citizens relied on the nation's rich mineral reserves, because of this, they hired mercenaries to fight for them.Currently, there is a revolution being led by forces seeking unification.

Its setting was also updated to reflect a more modern period. Much of the gameplay design still remains in tact, however, with a mix of puzzle solving and combat performed within a series of fixed camera angles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each protagonist's gameplay differs in terms of the amount of action and puzzle related gameplay that the player will face with Carnby being the more action-orientated portion of the game and Aline's being more puzzle-orientated. Though the player can chose between either protagonist the stories of each of the characters both occur at the same time and interwoven together. Though there is no major difference in terms of how each character is controlled.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersEdward CarnbyCarnby.A thirty-three year old private eye, Edward Carnby travelled to Shadow Island to discover what exactly happened to his best friend, Charles Fiske, when Fiske was found dead on Shadow Island. As Carnby becomes more involved with the events taking place on Shadow Island, he becomes less interested in his initial goals and concentrates on finding a way off the island and to ensure Aline's safety.Aline CedracAline.A 27 year old Ethnology Professor at Boston University, Aline Cedrac travelled to Shadow Island to help Professor Obed Morton decipher Abkannis writing tablets as well as to search for the identity of her father.EdenshawThe last Abkannis witchdoctor, Edenshaw came to Shadow Island many years ago and has lived with the Morton family ever since. Edenshaw has watched over the Morton family for many years and has made it his mission to ensure that the gate to the World of Darkness is never opened. Edenshaw acts as an assistant to the player and will appear every now and again to reveal information that may or may not be necessary to the player. He plays a major role towards the end of the game.Edward MortonInitially Edward assisted his brother in attempting to open the gate to the World of Darkness and made deals with Christopher Lamb in order to gain 'supplies' that he required in order to make further progress. Edward was revered by many for his work on the Abkannis tribe, though they were unaware of his methods of discovery. After a period of time, Edward realised just how terrible the things he was doing were and turned against his brother, Adam, refusing to assist him.PlotCharles Fiske, Edward Carnby's partner and best friend has been reported dead off the coast of Shadow Island. Carnby decides to investigate his best friend's death which leads him to meet with Frederick Johnson, Johnson informs Carnby of three ancient stone tablets that Fiske was searching for. The tablets are believed to unlock some form of incredibly dangerous power.Johnson requests that Carnby should take up Fiske's investigation and to search for the tablets. Carnby accepts that it is his personal priority however, is to find whoever killed Fiske. Johnson introduces Carnby to Aline Cedrac, a young and intelligent university professor. Aline accompanies Carnby to Shadow Island to help recover the tablets as well as to assist Professor Obed Morton, who she believes is her long-lost father. As their plane nears the coast of Shadow Island, it comes under attack by a creature of the island, which forces them to parachute out of the plane. They are separated, Aline landing atop the roof of a mansion and Carnby landing in some woods nearby.[CR]Ports[CR]Game Boy ColorAlone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color by Pocket Studios and was first released in Europe alongside its console counterparts on May 18, 2001. The port was later released in America on June 25, 2001.When Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color the handheld could not handle the 3D environments of the game, so the 3D was abandoned in favor of 2D sprites. The Game Boy Color received a relatively faithful port of the home console game. While the home console versions could be completed in six to eight hours, the Game Boy Color port could be completed in just one.[CR]Film[CR]In 2005, a film adaptation directed by the infamous Uwe Boll was released based on the video game series. The movie was supposed to be a direct sequel to the fourth game in the series, Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, although the movie has little-to-no relation to the original trilogy of games from the 1990s. The movie contains plot elements that directly contradict those in The New Nightmare, thus it is not considered canonical. The movie was named the \"Lowest-Grossing Game Based Movie\" in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008 edition.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP / Vista / 7Processor : 1.4 GHz processorMemory : 256 MB RAM ( 512 MB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c, 256 MB VRAMHard Drive : 1.5 GB available space[CR]Availability[CR]AitD: The New Nightmare can be purchased at GOG, Steam, GamersGate, and Humble Bundle.[CR]External Links[CR]Spiral House[CR]",

The game was later released in North America and Europe under the simplified Bangai-O, though it was exclusive to the Sega Dreamcast rather than the Nintendo 64.  In the game, players take control of a single mecha known as the Bangaioh, piloted by two young pilots by the names of Riki and Mami. The plot is the same as almost every shmup: an evil contraband menace (called the \"Cosmo Gang\" in this game) are out to destroy Earth and you must protect it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The controls in Bangai-O will also be familiar to any long-time shoot-'em-up player: the Bangaioh can move in eight directions, controlled by either the D-pad or the joystick. The ship can also fire in eight directions, controlled by the four yellow buttons and the A and B buttons on the controller.  However, Bangaioh does have its own unique elements to differentiate it from other shmups of the era. The Bangaioh has two firing modes that are represented by the pilot in control. If Riki is in control, red homing missiles are fired by the \"special attack\" button. If Mami is in control, blue lasers that bounce off of walls are fired. One can also use a 360 move in conjunction with the special attacks, in which 40-400 shots will be fired in a 360 spurt at all the nearest enemy bullets and enemies, with the amount of shots fired depending on quantity and proximity of the enemies and the enemies' bullets. For homing missiles, the missiles split up and target the nearest enemies and bullets, whilst the lasers automatically hit one target and bounce away.     The laser 360 attack being used.     At the beginning of the level, two 360 attacks are given. A total of 10 can be obtained per level by racking up combo points based on the amount of enemies or enemy ammunition destroyed. Upon reaching 100 combo points or more, the player can choose to gain the attack, refill their life, take a massive point boost, or temporary invincibility. Different levels of these power-ups can be obtained, and are based on how many combo points the player has.   Differences between Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast versions:The Dreamcast version utilizes an explosion meter rather than a combo system to gain special attacks. The meter is filled based on the size of explosions made when enemy ammunition and enemies are destroyed.  The game's special attack is much more effective in the Dreamcast version, and can not be charged, unlike in the Nintendo 64 version.In the Dreamcast version, Riki's shots do more damage than Mami's shots. Mami's shots are also semi-homing following a bounce. [CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to the Nintendo 64 version of Bangai-O was composed by Toshiya Yamanaka and Aki Hata, while the Dreamcast version was composed by Norio Hanzawa (under his alias NON). The soundtrack did not see an official release until 2008, when it was released as a 3CD set titled 'BANGAI-O SPIRITS Audio Collection Plus', which compiled the music from the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 versions of the game, along with the music from Bangai-O Spirits.

Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action turned up and tactics turned down. Add spectacular graphics, lots of \"power-ups\" (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your supply ships), and you have a pretty good looking shooter. The game is mouse driven with keyboard inputs for things like speed and weapon selection. The plot is your typical \"fight against all odds\" story.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Sword of the Berserk: Guts\u2019 Rage is a 3D hack & slash game for the Dreamcast. The game is based on the popular manga and anime series Berserk, written by Kentaro Miura. The game was developed by Yuke\u2019s Co. Ltd and published in Japan by ASCII Corporation and in the rest of the world by Eidos Interactive. The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1999, in the United States on February 29, 2000 and in Europe on May 19, 2001. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens up with a cutscene depicting a group of traveling performers getting ambushed by bandits. After some brief dialogue the eponymous hero of the game, Guts, shows up and takes care of the bandits. Afterwards you are introduced to Guts, his lover Casca, his sidekick Puck and the travelling performer Rita. Guts and his company decide to head to the next town, once there they learn about a plant called the Mandragora which when attached to someone, turns its hosts into zombie-like creatures. There they meet the ruler of the town and kingdom, Baron Balzac.Baron Balzac tells them that he believes he has found a cure for the Mandragoran plague. He tells of a great tree and its heart which is the proposed cure. To save Casca, Gus agrees to travel to the tree and cut out its heart. [CR]Characters  [CR]Guts: Guts is one of only two people to survive the solar eclipse massacre at the mercy of the God Hand\u2019s minions. He now wanders the world seeking revenge against them, armed with the mighty Dragon Slayer sword.Guts was branded with a mark as he fled the God Hand\u2019s massacre. The brand serves as a tracking device for the God Hand, but it also forewarns of danger and imparts Guts\u2019 Berserk rage. It will change and bleed as God Hand draws nearer or when the minions perform a human sacrifice.Casca: Once, Casca was the feared leader of the Hawks. But the God Hand\u2019s massacre left her so severely traumatized that it drove her to madness. Her total recovery is in doubt. Only Guts\u2019 love may save her.Puck: Puck is Guts\u2019 diminutive fairy partner. By nature cheerful and easily elated, Puck is a valuable elfin friend.Rita: Rita is a traveling performer, perhaps of gypsy descent. An adept knife handler, she learned this talent as part of her performance. This fascinating street-artist is a strong-willed ally.Baron Balzac: Baron Balzac is the tyrannical ruler of the Kingdom infested by Mandragora\u2019s minions. He is wise and strong, but his motives are clouded. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Like many other third-person action games you control your character and go around killing enemies to progress through linear levels. There are basic combos in the game that are mixed up through a horizontal attack and vertical attack. Besides his sword, Guts also uses throwing knives, a hand cannon, grenades and a hand-held crossbow. These secondary weapons are powerful but use limited ammunition; except the throwing knives and hand-held crossbow. These weapons are utilized in a format similar to the quick menu system used in Phantasy Star Online: press the trigger and you\u2019ll have access to these secondary weapons.Guts has a health bar as well as a meter that builds up with every successful hit and when full, Guts enters Berserk mode in which his attacks are stronger, he moves faster and is temporarily invulnerable. In Berserk mode, Guts also has the ability to swing his sword through walls. This is a major advantage in cramped setting as Guts' sword is eight feet long making fighting in hallways and corridors very hard. Throughout the game you will have to perform quick-time events, from jumping over a falling bridge to dodging falling rubble.There are save points in the game but there are very few, about five throughout the game. You also have a limited number of lives that differ between difficulty levels: seven for easy, ten for normal and thirteen for the hard. [CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Resident Evil: Code: Veronica is the fourth mainline Resident Evil game, leading directly after the events of Resident Evil 2 as protagonist Claire Redfield continues her search for her brother, Chris Redfield. She is inadvertently captured by Umbrella, however, although a conveniently timed attack unto the base she is held allows her a chance to make her escape.Code: Veronica X, which was released only a year later on PlayStation 2, is an upgraded port from the original Dreamcast release. It plays the exact same, though it features a couple of added cutscenes--both involving the series sinister villain Albert Wesker--and minor graphical updates, including Steve Burnside receiving a redone hairstyle.Code: Veronica X is thusly viewed as the 'true' rendition of the game and is the version that was ported over to the GameCube, and which underwent the HD treatment with the Resident Evil Revival Collection alongside Resident Evil 4.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] & ControlsCode: Veronica is notable for featuring 3D environments as opposed to pre-renderedMuch like previous main Resident Evil entries, Code: Veronica mixes in third-person combat, exploration and puzzle solving. Code: Veronica only has the one storyline, like Resident Evil 3: Nemesis before it.The combat continues to confine the player to the ground when firing their weapon, and the notorious tank controls are still in effect. Players must also once again move via a series of pre-determined camera angles, though auto-aim is turned on by default, allowing players a means to note if there are enemies outside of their vision. Simultaneously pressing down and the 'run' button will have the player character perform an immediate 180 degree turn.Code: Veronica marks the first time that the series enters into full 3D, with the environments now being made up of polygons as opposed to the pre-rendered backgrounds of old. Veronica is also much lengthier than previous games on average, to perhaps account for its single storyline.Despite being the fourth game in the series and released after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Veronica ended up making a few steps back in terms of available mechanics and features. Nearly all of the updates brought about from Resident Evil 3 aren't apart of the game--because they were both developed at the same time causing a dissonance between the two--such as players being able to create their own ammo, live-selection choices, and the dodge maneuver. Though destructible barrels still persist and can be shot to deal a great degree of damage to any nearby enemies - including the player too if they're within range of the explosion.There are a couple of dual-wielding firearms available to wield in the gameThough what's especially notable is the fact that walking up/down staircases is once again automated and can't be performed manually. Zombies, however, can freely walk up/down staircases at will, which will also result in the player having to wait for it to make its ascent/descent before they can then use the staircase themselves.Gore has been slightly toned down. Zombies heads no longer have the capability to explode like in previous Resident Evils, nor can their limbs fall off. When shot with a magnum, or a close-range shotgun blast to the head, the zombie's head would gush out blood but still stay intact.Playable CharactersWhile only featuring the one selectable story, Veronica still includes two main playable characters. For the first half of the game players take up the role of Claire Redfield, then by the second will play as her brother, Chris Redfield. Both Redfields control the exact same and there are no mechanical or statistical differences between the two.During a short period of Chris's portion, players will temporarily return to the role of Claire. Supporting character Steve Burnside will also be controlled for an extremely brief time while he tests out his new dual submachine guns, though he too plays identical to Claire & Chris.InventoryAll characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots (to which can be eventually increased to ten), along with a ninth/eleventh slot that can equip a unique item. This can either be a lighter, to which is what Claire finds first, or a lockpick that she can attain later on in exchange for the lighter. If Claire receives the lockpick, Chris Redfield will then be able to receive the lighter for his part of the game. If she does not then Chris will gain the lockpick. Steve Birkin's unique item is a photograph of he and his parents.The lighter can be equipped like a weapon, though while it has no means of attack it can help illuminate the area, as well as ward away any bats. It also gives Chris access to the dual submachine guns. The lockpick can be used to unlock a number of drawers and lockers for additional supplies.All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.There are certain weapons that will take up two inventory slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:Calico Model 100 Dual PistolsDual Ingram Machine PistolsDual Golden LugersAK-47 Assault RifleM37 Sniper RifleBesides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game. Items stored in the box can be collected by each of the two characters; meaning that anything left in the item box as Claire can then be collected as Chris. However to take advantage of this feature players must plan before hand as there is no actual forewarning of when players are about to switch characters.Health & Herbs/First Aid SpraysA character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine (Green) - The character is in good health.Caution (Yellow) - The character is roughly at half health.Danger (Red) - The character is approaching death.Poison (Purple) - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.Red Herb - On its own does nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.SavingAs with Resident Evil games pre-Resident Evil 4, Code: Veronica requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.Should the player die, the game will allow them to immediately reload their latest save from the ''Death'' screen, rather than having to head back to the main menu.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersClaire RedfieldThe initial leading protagonist, Claire is roped into another zombie infested crisis after she attempts to learn more about her brother Chris Redfield's whereabouts. She is playable throughout the first half of the game where she is relegated to the role of an NPC for most of the second half.Upon surviving the destruction of Raccoon City, Claire has grown in confidence when it comes to B.O.W. threats.Voiced by Alyson Court.Chris RedfieldThe main protagonist during the second half of the game and Claire Redfield's brother. Chris was forwarded a message by Leon S. Kennedy about Claire's predicament on Rockfort Island and travels over to try and save her.By this time, only months since the destruction of Raccoon City, the S.T.A.R.S team has been disbanded. Yet despite this Chris still chose to wear a S.T.A.R.S. uniform during this excursion.Voiced by Michael Filipowich.Steve BurnsideSteve with his revised Veronica X haircutA supporting character and love-interest towards Claire Redfield. Steve is a brash, insecure teenager, and fellow prisoner on Rockfort Island. A complete show-off, Steve is always attempting to win Claire Redfield's affection with bouts of bravery, putting himself at huge risk of danger at every turn.Voiced by Bill Houston.Alfred AshfordThe first antagonist the player encounters, Alfred Ashford is in charge of the Rockfort Island base. He is an eccentric yuppie, with an ''above average'' IQ and has a fondness for using sniper rifles. He and his twin-sister Alexia's fondness for pulling the wings off of dragonflies as children makes for an early indicator to support their cold and cruel nature.Alfred also noticeably has a rather peculiar laugh that almost resembles a little girls.Voiced by Peter Oldring.Voiced by Leila Johnson during Alfred's phases were he would dress up as Alexia.Alexia AshfordThe primary antagonist and twin sister to Alfred. A certified genius, Alexia was given the duties of leading an entire team of scientists within Umbrella by the age of ten. This infamous capacity of skill garnished her a rivalry with fellow Umbrella Scientist William Birkin.Like her twin-brother, Alexia is shown to be something of megalomaniac, perhaps even more so than Alfred.Voiced by Leila Johnson.Albert WeskerDespite apparently 'dying' at the hands of his own creation--The T-002 Tyrant--during Resident Evil, Wesker returns into the fold empowered with enhanced agility and strength. His characteristic arrogance is in full effect, if it hasn't grown all the more due to his new abilities.The events of the original Resident Evil has resulted in Wesker gaining a seething hatred towards Chris Redfield in particular for thwarting his plans.Voiced by Richard Waugh.This marked the first time Richard voiced Wesker.PlotClaireThe game takes place three months after the events of RE2 and RE3. It begins with Claire Redfield raiding an Umbrella Base in Paris, after leaving Leon and Sherry to search for her brother, Chris Redfield. Claire gets caught during her raid, and she is captured and taken to Rockfort island where she meets with an inmate named Steve Burnside and they fight for their survival against the island's T-virus infected zombies. In the meantime, Albert Wesker is on a mission to recover the T-Veronica-Virus and it's his unit's fault that Rockport is now infected. Claire and Steve escape in a plane but it was set on autopilot to go to an Umbrella facility in the Antarctic, by the islands commander, Alfred Ashford. Alfred did that so he could awaken his sister from a cryogenic sleep that she was in for 15 years after she had an injection of T-Veronica-Virus. Claire and Steve defeat Alfred and escape in a digger, while Alfred limps over to his sister and experiences her awakening before dying. Alexia summons giant tentacles and grabs Steve and Claire's digger recapturing them both.ChrisThe game then flips over to Chris Redfield's perspective. After learning from Leon that his sister has been taken to Rockport he goes there and learns she has been long gone. He has an encounter with Albert Wesker and almost dies, but is saved as Alexia appears on the screen and stuns Wesker because he thought she had been dead for years. Wesker takes off to Antarctica and Chris follows. He is reunited with Claire and the two of them set out to find Steve. When they find Steve she realizes that Alexia has been experimenting on him with the T-Veronica-Virus and he has mutated into a giant reptilian monster and he tries to kill Claire. Claire runs into a prison cell but is grabbed by Alexia's tentacles, but Steve breaks through the bars and saves Claire but injures himself fatally. He reverts to human form and tells Claire that he loves her before dying.Meanwhile, Wesker and Chris fight Alexia, but Wesker was overwhelmed by her strength and he takes off. Chris manages to defeat her, but she comes back to life after Chris activates the self destruct system, releasing all the locks in the facility freeing Claire. Chris then destroys Alexia for the final time and him and Claire run to the emergency elevator where they see Wesker and his men taking Steve's body for further experiments. Claire runs to the plane, and Chris and Wesker have another showdown until they are separated by an explosion. Wesker vows to get his revenge next time they meet and then they both run to avoid dying in more explosions. The game ends with Claire and Chris escaping and Chris vowing to take down Umbrella once and for all.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Combat KnifeA standard survival knife that Claire finds in prison office where the game begins. Unlike previous Resident Evil entries, the knife can prove to be surprisingly effective (particularly when used to strike at the legs or head of a zombie) and is much more powerful. It's still not a suitable replacement for any of the firearms, though it doesn't constitute a death-wish should the player decide to test it out.Beretta M93 HandgunA 9mm handgun that Claire finds near the beginning, after she first meets Steve Burnside. It fires rather rapidly for a pistol and is reliable against most lesser enemies - zombies and Cerberus dogs in particular. It can potentially be upgraded to allow a triple burst shot, should the player find the components required. Chris can also use this handgun should the player leave it in an inventory box as Claire for Chris to collect.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Ammunition - 9mm Parabellum Rounds.Glock Model 17 HandgunA 9mm handgun that Chris Redfield brings with him when he embarks on the rescue for his sister Claire Redfield. It primarily features all of the same attributes as Claire's Beretta and can be modified also, though instead of giving a three shot burst it increases the overall power.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Ammunition - 9mm Parabellum Rounds.Colt PythonA recurring weapon within the series, the Colt Python Magnum Pistol can be attained once more in Code: Veronica. Found during Chris Redfield's segment of the story, it is immensely powerful, can kill all standard enemies with one shot, and is a solid contender against boss B.O.W's. Ammo is fairly scarce though, to make up for its well retained status as one of the most powerful firearms in the game.Maximum Ammo Count - 6 rounds.Ammunition - .357 Caliber Rounds.Bow GunMuch like her time during Resident Evil 2, Claire will have access to a bow gun. It's made to be significantly weaker than its RE2 counterpart, however, and relies solely via bug-bite attacks with its usually large containment of ammo. It can hold as many arrows at once as Claire can find, and can also stock explosive bolts if the player combines a bolt pack with explosive gun-powder.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - Bolts & Explosive Bolts.Calico Model 100 Dual PistolsDual weapons were a first for the series, introduced early on via the Calico Model 100 Dual Pistols. They were reliable against most enemies because of their power and imbued ability to aim at two simultaneous enemies. Their ammo count was ranked as a percentage and no other ammo could be found, giving them a very limited use. Because they're still technically two firearms, they take up two slots in the inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by % with each shot taking off 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Dual Ingram Machine PistolsInitially introduced during the short segment where the player controls Steve Burnside, they are primarily used throughout Chris Redfield's side of the story. They are only made available, however, should Claire give Rodrigo Juan Raval her lighter before hand. Much like the Calico Pistols, they label their ammunition via percentage and no ammo can be found once they've run out. The Ingram Pistols fire-rate is significantly faster than the Calico Pistols, and can also allow the player to aim at two different enemies simultaneously. Because they're still technically two firearms, they take up two slots in the inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by % with each shot taking off 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Dual Golden LugersThough they are seen frequently during the main story--as a puzzle item and Steve's weapons of choice before receiving the dual machine pistols--they are only used as a weapon in the Battle Game minigame when playing as Steve Burnside. They are similar to the Calico Pistols, though are much slower to fire. Like close to all firearms in the Battle Game they have infinite ammo.Maximum Ammo Count - N/A.Ammunition - N/A.M79 Grenade LauncherAlso returning from Claire's repertoire in Resident Evil 2 is the Grenade Launcher; an all-round reliable weapon, suitable for virtually any encounters - including boss battles. It features multiple grenade types, including the default grenades as well as flame, acid and gas. It can store as much ammo as possible so long as it's all the same type of grenade. Should the player switch them out for a different type of grenade, the grenades initially in the weapon will stack nicely in the characters inventory only taking up a single slot no matter how much ammo it stacks.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - Multiple variety of grenades.Spas 12 Gauge ShotgunFirst found by Chris, the Spas fills in the mandatory Shotgun slot for Code: Veronica. It carries a lot of the expected attributes, though is surprisingly weaker than most shotguns of the series and isn't as easy to fall back on for boss battles. It is nonetheless suitable against zombies at close-range and some of the larger B.O.W's such as Hunters.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 shots.Ammunition - 12 Gauge Rounds.AK-47 Assault RifleA rather unorthodox weapon for a Resident Evil game, the AK-47 is only found during Chris' segment of the story. Much like the dual wielding weapons, it's ammo count is labelled via percentage, though extra AK ammo can be procured. It is fully automatic and packs a great deal of power, proving vital against any and all enemies encountered. Because of its sturdy combination of both power and speed, it is given the handicap of requiring two inventory spaces to carry.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by %, with each shot taking roughly 1%.Ammunition - 7.62x39mm Soviet Rounds.M37 Sniper RifleThe first ever sniper rifle introduced into the series, the M37 is used only once during a mid-game boss battle against the once-human Alexander Ashford, later dubbed Nosferatu. It is most often seen in the hands of Alfred Ashford as he pesters Claire throughout the first half of the game. During the one occasion it's available, it allows the player to go into a first-person view mode for better accuracy (another first for the main series, discounting Resident Evil Survivor). It only has 7 rounds, though that can be more than the player requires, should they be able to shoot Nosferatu directly in its exposed heart. This is easier said than done, however, with the icy fog surrounding the area and Nosferatu's constant expulsion of a poisonous gas.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 sniper rounds.Ammunition - N/A.Linear LauncherThe end game one-off weapon and Rocket Launcher equivalent for Code: Veronica, the Linear Launcher is a strange weapon that fires electrical homing rockets. It is only used canonically during the finale battle against the mutated blob-form of Alexia Ashford. It can be unlocked for the main game with infinite ammo should the player gain an S rank - as well as the Battle Game minigame, with the same properties, should the player gain an S rank with every character.Maximum Ammo Count - N/A.Ammunition - N/A.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]ZombiesThe walking dead are once again prevalent in Code: Veronica and share a lot of the usual properties of their other Resident Evil kin; slow, shambling movement, dangerous up close but susceptible to all weapons within the game. On occasion, zombies will vomit out acid if they can't quite reach the player.Zombie HoundAnother trademark enemy of the series, zombie dogs are always encountered in packs and contain the same agility and brutality as a standard dog. They're rather weak fortunately, and can be taken down swiftly with a few handgun or shotgun shots. Regardless, even with their rampant speed and tenacity, player-characters are still just ever-so-slightly faster and can outrun them.BandersnatcherLarge, yellow one-armed monsters, Bandersnatchers have only appeared in the Veronica games. They rely on their single long arm to stretch and attack the player, and will do so very frequently given the opportunity. They can also use their arm to latch onto walls and maneuver through the environment following the player. They're pretty sturdy as well and stand as one of the most antagonizing enemies within the game.Bandersnatchers are also only encountered on Rockfort Island during Claire's portion of the story, though Chris does face one as he searches for Claire on the island.Hunter IIWhile being very similar in appearance to the Hunter Alpha's from the original Resident Evil, these Hunter models are much more advanced and sophisticated; they can be partnered with a small surveillance robot called Seekers that'll search for its targeted prey, alerting any nearby Hunters should it locate it. They attack very much like all Hunters of the series and can still commit an instant-kill attack should the player's health be in the Caution state or lower. Hunters have formidable resistance to most weapons and are best contended with the Colt Python Magnum or AK-47 Assault Rifle - running away would be the best alternative.They are only encountered during Chris Redfield's portion of the story as they were brought in by Albert Wesker himself, who programmed them to specifically hunt down Chris.SweeperSweepers are a variant of the Hunter II model, distinguished by their reddish colour. They attack in the same patterns and can still be called upon via one of the Seeker robots. What most separates them from the standard Hunters is that their attacks can poison the player.These, too, are only encountered during Chris Redfield's portion of the story.Black WidowThese are the giant spiders of Veronica, instead opting for Black Widows over the usual tarantula arachnids. While they look significantly different from their peers, they act very similar and have the same array of attacks, with their poison-spit once again acting as their greatest weapon.CrowsAs always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They do minimal damage and can often be killed with a single bullet; their numbers are always many, however. Sometimes a shotgun blast might be worth it to take a pack down, but otherwise they're best just ignored.BatsBats function nearly the exact same as crows. The one particular difference is that they can be warded away should the player equip the lighter.MothsOnly encountered in the Antarctica base, Moths primarily function similar to crows. They constantly emit a poisonous gas, however, and can also latch onto the player leaving a maggot sack on the characters back; the player is forced to wait for the character to throw the sack off before they can leave the area. They're easy to kill, but because they often respawn once the player has leaved, it's most profitable to dash past them.Albinoid InfantThese are only encountered briefly when Claire Redfield enters a lab to collect a specific painting; they can't be killed and only act as a minor obstacle for walking through the lab. One of them will escape and will eventually become a boss battle later on.Alexia TentacleSprouting through the environment, these are tentacles spawned by the now monstrous Alexia Ashford. They will block the players path, forcing the player to shoot any that they will encounter. Fortunately they are relatively weak and don't require much ammo.[CR]Boss Battles[CR]Gulp Worm Part IWhile it isn't given much of an introduction, a giant worm titled the Gulp Worm will eventually be found burrowing outside the Military Training Facility throughout Claire Redfield's portion of the story. During this occasion it is completely optional to fight and can be largely ignored if the player is fast enough. The option to fight is still there, but would primarily be a waste of ammo since it doesn't reward anything minus its evacuation of the area, and will still be encountered later on as Chris Redfield.Gulp Worm Part IIOnce Chris Redfield arrives at Rockfort Island to save his sister Claire, unbeknownst that she's already left for Antarctica, he is ambushed by the Gulp Worm from before. After swallowing Rodrigo Juan Raval whole, Chris is forced to fight it. Its design includes a lot of surprise attacks, burrowing underground then quickly resurfacing for an attack. Sometimes it'll pop out and do a kind of roar, giving players the opportunity to attack it.While this battle is going on, the elevator that'll take Chris up to the surface is making its slow descent; it essentially acts as the timer for the boss battle, and as such if the elevator arrives before the player kills the Gulp Worm, they can opt to avoid this battle and just use the elevator. Choosing this outcome will deprive the player of the lighter Rodrigo may give, however - if Claire gave it to him before hand that is.Tyrant T-103 Part IAn alternate version of the Mr. X Tyrant model encountered during Resident Evil 2, this model is encountered twice by Claire Redfield. It differs in appearance from its coated brethren, equipped with a large, round mallet-like right fist with a large claw--as is custom with most Tyrant models-- for its left. The first time it is encountered, the player is cornered in a narrow passage with the Tyrant impeding the players progress forward, with a raging fire blocking the rear. Should the player walk into the fire, they will die instantly, forcing the player to unload everything they have into the Tyrant as it slowly makes its advance.Tyrant T-103 Part IIThe Tyrant is once again fought just as Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside are attempting to escape Rockfort Island. Somehow managing to latch onto the cargo hold, the player has to weaken the Tyrant with gunfire and then attempt to knock the Tyrant out the back with a large crate released from its safety harness. The Tyrant is otherwise invincible and cannot be killed without attempting to knock it out through the back with the crate.NosferatuOnce Alexander Ashford--the man twins Alfred and Alexia were cloned from--he was experimented on with the Veronica Virus to such an extent that he became yet another addition to the B.O.W. library. Initially seen through a grated floor, tightly strapped to a chair with a huge halberd resting on him, he eventually manages to escape and is fought on a rooftop by Claire Redfield. His main source of attack is through a constant expulsion of poisonous gas that covers a huge area of effect; up close, he has a series of sharp appendages that have sprouted out of multiple areas of his body that he can attack with. Nosferatu moves slowly, though the large cast of fog that covers the battleground can make attacking him difficult.At this point the player has access to a Sniper Rifle with 7 shots available; using the first-person view, the player can potentially kill Nosferatu with a single hit should they shoot his exposed heart well enough. Whether Claire is poisoned during this fight also factors later on in the story when Chris Redfield finds her. If she was poisoned, Chris must search for a specific antidote (blue herbs won't work) before the story can carry on.Albinoid AdultThe full grown Albinoid creature Claire encountered only hours before has now fully grown into a huge amphibious lizard-like monster. Completely surfaced under a shallow pool--literally, within a swimming pool--it is the de-facto guardian of an emblem the player needs to collect. The Albinoid will periodically discharge an aura of electricity, however, making it very dangerous to enter. The Albinoid is completely harmless otherwise, as it doesn't leave the pool. The player can opt to kill it, but if timed right can also enter the pool and collect the emblem with minimal damage.Giant Black WidowFirst seen under a sea of ice covering the main hall of the Umbrella Antarctica Base, Chris Redfield is forced to use a crane to crack the ice open to pull out the corpse of Nosferatu to claim his signet ring. This of course unleashes the Giant Black Widow. Simply massive, the Black Widow attacks much like its smaller kin but with a much larger poison spit arc.Steve BurnsideLike her father Alexander, Alexia infected Steve Burnside with the Veronica virus after she captured him and Claire. With a brief stint back as Claire during Chris' portion of the story, she finds him strapped to a chair with a large halberd resting on him exactly like Alexander. Just as Claire attempts to release him from the chair, Steve begins to mutate turning into a kind of green ogre. He equips the halberd with ease and begins to chase Claire. Steve isn't intended to be fought and the player can only run, as Steve can kill the player with just two hits, and a series of gates are being locked down through the hallway, forcing the player to stop for nothing.Alexia Ashford Humanoid FormComing off of Claire's encounter with the mutated Steve, Wesker and Alexia--now completely nude and mutated into a grey-ish color--engage in a fight with Wesker only just scraping by; noticing Chris Redfield hiding nearby, he calls it onto his ''best man'' to take care of her. Alexia herself is a relatively easy battle as they go, but her attacks can do severe damage. She will walk slowly towards the player, leeching a small line of blood which quickly bursts into flames. If the player is caught in it they have to wait through the animation of Chris attempting to wave the flames off.Alexia Ashford Sack FormShe is initially seen once again in her humanoid form as she halts Claire as she attempts to run away. If the player doesn't react, shooting Alexia with literally anything, then Alexia will kill Claire causing a game over. If the player does shoot her, she will then transform into a huge blob creature with what look like dragonfly wings, but still retaining the majority of her previous mutations face. Because of Alexia's size, the player has very little room to maneuver and only has running access on a roughly 75 degree angle. Alexia herself mostly relies on her large tentacles that'll slam down on the player. She also summons a group of small pod like creatures that plant themselves and spout out a strange tail that'll whip the player. The player can kill them, (though they prove difficult because of their size) but Alexia will eventually replace them with more. In true Resident Evil fashion, a five minute timer is ticking down during this battle.Alexia Ashford Dragonfly FormAfter Alexia Sack Form has taken enough damage, she will exit her sack and hover above the player. At the same time the Linear Launcher, which Chris and Claire prepared to power-up, is now available. Using the Linear Launcher, the player is to try and shoot down Alexia; her constant movement can make this tricky, however. Her only attack during this form is that same line of fluid she shoots out that bursts into flames. This form of Alexia isn't particularly difficult as a boss and the difficulty is built around the 5 minute timer that'll still be ticking down during this battle.[CR]Battle Game[CR]The Battle Game is a time-trial mode that is unlocked after a single completion of the main game. Here it allows the player to choose from a select few of the main cast from Veronica X to play as and make their way through a set number of rooms. The rooms themselves are all unrelated to one another and stretch across environments throughout the entire game. Each character has their own unique load-out, though they have infinite ammo for all weapons; the main goal of the mode is to primarily get a decent time, rather than try make do with limited supplies. To pass on to the next room, however, every enemy must first be killed.Initially, only Claire and Chris are available, though if the player finds the broken Golden Luger pistol during the main game, Steve Burnside will be unlocked from the outset. He can otherwise still be unlocked if the player completes the mode as Claire. Albert Wesker also makes his playable debut for the Battle Game, and is unlocked via a completion with Chris in the mode. The final character is an alternate costume of Claire that is also unlocked after a single completion as default Claire in the Battle Game. Claire's alternate costume is exclusive for the Battle Game mode, however, and cannot be worn through the main game. Should the player get an S ranking for all characters, they unlock a Linear Launcher with infinite ammo (the Linear Launcher is also unlockable with infinite ammo for the main-game if the player scores an S ranking).Albert Wesker's Epilogue screenWhat is unique about the Battle Game is that introduces the option to play in a first person view. The controls are still the same, though, and players still cannot shoot and move either, arguably making the FP mode more of an intriguing gimmick than a substantial alternative.[CR]Xbox 360, PS3 Version[CR]On March 23 2011, Capcom announced that Resident Evil 4 HD and Code: Veronica X HD would be coming to XBLA and PSN as two separate downloads in the Summer of the same year. This is of course in contrast to the compilation disc, entitled \"Resident Evil Revival Selection\" which received a Japanese-only release sometime before the fall. As the title suggests, it features enhanced 720p HD resolutions, as well as a full 1000 points Achievement score across 12 achievements, and 12 trophies for the PS3. No Platinum Trophy, however.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Disc 1Resident Evil: Code Veronica Original Soundtrack (Japanese cover art.)The MovieTitle CallingPrologueOpening - Claire VersionThrown Into DespairOnce AgainFirst ContactDeath SiegeSteve's ChafeIncomingPutrid SmellThe Palace of InsaneA Moment of ReliefInfantsHot RescueThrough the ScopePiano RollGreetingsInductionOther side of GlassGetting OutTarget LockedPulsating Right ArmHere Comes the KnightEntrapmentCuriosityFatherLachrymalThe Suspended DollOne-man ShowAshford's Music BoxPandora's BoxThe Secret DoorNot AlexiaA State of EmergencyIt's Back!The Theme of Tyrant 3- Version AAs You WishRevenge!The Theme of Tyrant 3- Version BMidnight SunCrash!BlancThe Confined ITYou Think You're Safe NowResonance of BloodGo With the DiggerThe Theme of NosferatuThe Ending of the BeginningDisc 2The Opening- Chris VersionI Need To KnowR.I.P.

Several items and weapons can be purchased through coins earned from beating up monsters. Items do not work instantly; for example, drinking a soda takes a few seconds for it to fully affect your character. Beyond these nuances, Blue Stinger mainly involves going from place to place, solving puzzles, and exploring the environment.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Eliot G. Ballade is on a fishing trip with his friend Tim aboard the S.S Diana when a mysterious meteor crashes on an island below in the Yucatan Peninsula, creating some sort of dome around the island that prevents outside contact. Eliot swims to the island, and sees that it is now inhabited by monsters. He also notices he is being followed by a strange floating creature called Nephilim. After getting a radio call from a woman named  Janine King about helping survivors on the Island, Eliot is attacked by a huge beast, only to be saved by  Dogs Bower. Together, they move towards the main part of the island, only to be attacked by a sea monster. They are promptly saved by Janine, who continues to help them throughout the game. The three, with Dogs and Eliot as the playable characters, work towards figuring out what's going on in the island.[CR]",

Released for the arcades, and later for the Sega Dreamcast. in 2000, Cannon Spike is a linear game, heavily focused towards boss encounters. A main feature of the game is the ability to play as a number of familiar Capcom characters from other franchises.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player can use an 8-way direction stick, and four buttons in the arcades, or the thumbstick and face buttons of the Dreamcast controller. The player shoots the enemy with the characters standard weapon in any direction, and can lock on to individual enemies to strafe and more easily concentrate fire and avoid attacks. The player can also fire a more powerful charged shot, mel\u00e9e attack an enemy with a combo move, or mel\u00e9e attack an enemy with a more powerful single move that leaves the player more open to counter-attack. As is usual in top-down shooting games, there is also a \"super move\" that works as a \"screen-clearer\" or to take away large amounts of health from boss enemies. These are limited, and must be replendished by picking up power-ups throughout the level.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Cannon Spike features a number of pre-existing Capcom characters as playable avatars.Charlie (Nash)A first lieutenant in the United States Air Force, Charlie (known as Nash in Japan), is a character from the Street Fighter Alpha fighting series. He attacks with an assault rifle that bears resemblence to the real-world FAMAS. He can use his Somersault Shell move from Street Fighter, as well as his Sonic Break super.CammyAnother character from the Street Fighter series, Cammy has been around since Street Fighter II. Cannon Spike itself is named after one of Cammy's moves, which she can perform as her super move. She attacks with dual SMGs. Her blue costume from the Street Fighter Alpha games is an unlockable.Mega Man (Rockman)Capcom's platforming mascot and star of a hugely diverse range of titles. Megaman shoots at enemies with his Mega Buster, and uses a tornado hold attack for his melee.ArthurAn alternate depiction of Arthur from Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise. Arthur appears as a large mechanical knight, armed with a laser-firing lance. His small body is controlling his large mechanical shell; technology that is seemingly in the vein of a mech. The man himself is only seen in his ending, which shows him parachuting out of the machine in nothing but his signature heart-pattern briefs.Baby Bonnie Hood (Bulleta)The psychopathic-killer take on Red Riding Hood, from the Darkstalkers series. Her attacks are similar to those in Darkstalkers.Shiba ShintaroA slightly more obscure character from 3 Wonders, an arcade game released by Capcom in 1991. He moves and mel\u00e9e attacks using his hoverboard, and shoots with an assault rifle similar to Charlie's.SimoneCreated specifically for the game, and not appearing since, Simone is a cyborg with drastically enhanced strength. It is speculated that she may be based onLt. Linn Kurosawa from Capcom's Alien vs. Predator arcade game.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 is a 2D fighting game developed and distributed by Capcom for arcades (using the Sega NAOMI hardware) in 2000.Capcom's first offering in their crossover series with SNK, the game pits fighters from both Capcom's Street Fighter series and SNK's King of Fighters series in a massive worldwide martial arts tournament. Building on the team elimination mechanic from King of Fighters, the game introduces the \"Ratio\" system (in which players form different-sized teams from fighters of different strengths). It also introduces a new \"Groove\" system (in which players can choose between two different variations of super meters), a \"Groove Point System\" (a real-time ranking system for single-player mode that raises and lowers as the player fights), and a special \"EX\" version of most characters (changing their movelists).The game was later ported to the Dreamcast on November 9, 2000, adding color edit support, training mode, a variety of unlockable secret features, and Neo Geo Pocket Color support (allowing players to unlock secrets quicker when paired with SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium, both versions of SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighter's Clash, and SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters 2 Expand Edition). The arcade version was updated a year later as Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro, making use of the GD-ROM upgrade for the Sega NAOMI while adding two new characters (Dan Hibiki and Joe Higashi) and new moves for existing characters. This version was also ported to both the Dreamcast (in 2001, only in Japan) and the PlayStation (in 2002, as Capcom's final PS1 release).Capcom later developed a sequel, called Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, which builds upon the \"Ratio\" and \"Groove\" systems while adding new characters, 3D backgrounds, and new game mechanics. SNK's main entry in the series, SNK Vs. Capcom: Chaos, was planned to be released at the same time as this game, but was delayed for years after the company went bankrupt.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 plays like a traditional Capcom fighting game, using only four buttons (instead of their traditional six button layout): Light Punch, Hard Punch, Light Kick, and Hard Kick.Some of the fighting game mechanics included are rolling (performed by pressing both Light buttons simultaneously, giving the character temporary invincibility), throw escapes (performed by performing a Throw command while being grabbed by normal throws, cancelling the throw), super jumps (performed by tapping Down before jumping, giving the character a faster and higher jump), and dashing (performed by tapping Forward or Back twice, allowing characters to dodge attacks and close the gap between them). In the console versions, players can unlock running forward as a replacement for dashing (allowing players to close the gap quicker).Ratio SystemAn update to the team elimination style of the King of Fighters series (in which players must eliminate all of their opponent team's fighters sequentially, with no health regeneration between rounds), the \"Ratio\" system gives each player four \"Ratio Points\" to form their team with. Characters are separated into four strength tiers (Light, Average, Strong, Strongest), which affects both their offensive and defensive power. There are five combinations of teams that can be used:One R-4.One R-3, one R-1.Two R-2's.One R-2, two R-1's.Four R-1's.A hidden mode (unlocked in the console version as \"Pair Match Mode\") puts all characters in R-2 (changing their strength to match), simplifying the game into 2-on-2 team battles. This mode also allows players to pick the same character for both teammates.Groove SystemBefore selecting their characters, each player picks one of two \"Grooves\" to fight with. Each Groove changes the way the Super Meter is used during the fight (as well as changing the art style used for character portraits).Capcom Groove - Based on the early Street Fighter Alpha games (as well as A-Ism in Street Fighter Alpha 3), players are given a three-level Super Meter that is slowly replenished by hitting their opponent and performing special moves. They can perform different levels of their Super Moves, as long as they have enough meter to perform, by pressing different buttons for the move (Light for Lv. 1, Hard for Lv. 2, Light+Hard for Lv. 3). Some Super Moves can only be performed at Lv. 3.SNK Groove - Based on the early King of Fighters games (as well as Extra mode in The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98: The Slugfest), players are given one large Super Meter that can only be replenished by charging (holding both Hard buttons simultaneously). Once the meter is full, MAX mode activates and the fighter gets increased attack power as the meter slowly depletes. Players can perform their Super Move either during MAX mode (which fully depletes the meter) or when their vitality is low (as shown with a blinking vitality meter). When their vitality is low and MAX mode is active, they can perform a more powerful version of the Super Move (known as MAX Super Move). Some Super Moves can only be performed as MAX Super Moves.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes 28 playable fighters from the start, split up into four tiers of strength. All SNK characters are redrawn to fit Capcom's style, while most of Capcom's characters are based on their Street Fighter Alpha sprites (with the exception of Morrigan, who is based on her Darkstalkers sprites, and  Ryu, Ken, Dan, M. Bison, and Akuma, who are redrawn in the same style as the SNK characters).In addition, the game includes two hidden opponents (fought by reaching the fourth stage with no continues, five or more Super Move finishes, and at least 60 GPS) and one hidden boss (fought by reaching the final stage with no continues, ten or more Super Move finishes, and at least 80 HPS). All three hidden characters, along with more powerful versions of Ryu and Iori, are unlockable for play (by the arcade operators).All characters, with the exception of the hidden characters, Ryu, and Iori, have a special \"EX\" variant (which can be used by holding Start while selecting that character, must be unlocked in the console versions) which change some of their movelists.The \"Pro\" update to the game adds two additional characters (Dan and Joe) for play, updating the total roster to 35.CapcomAll characters are from the Street Fighter series (with the exception of hidden character Morrigan from the Darkstalkers series).Ratio 1 (Light)BlankaCammyDan (added in the Pro update)DhalsimSakuraRatio 2 (Average)Balrog (M.

Instead of a turban and beat up hubcaps, the player wears trendy clothing and has a blinged-out ride. The goal is to drive patrons from location to location in the hopes of getting the most money possible in a given time limit. The time increases with every pleased patron and there's bonuses for getting patrons to their destination very quickly.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Crazy Taxi, the player can chose one of four cabbies to pick people up and dive them from one destination to another. They have to get to the destinations as quickly as possible to maximize the amount of money they get from a fare. The clock is constantly ticking down; the player will have to dodge cars and hit jumps to get around as quickly as possible. The game also has several abilities the player can use during gameplay. One of them is the \"Crazy Drift\", performed by pressing reverse then the drive button while turning the car--it's useful for getting through tight corners. The other is the \"Crazy Boost\", performed by pressing the reverse then the drive button quickly--it's a good way to speed the car up.Crazy Taxi includes many real-world brands and franchises like Tower Records, Pizza Hut and Fila. Many assume that the inclusion of these were paid advertising, in fact SEGA paid to include these brands.

It was the final Crazy Taxi game to be released on the system. In 2007, a port of the game made its way on the    PSP along with the original game in the form of   Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars. Crazy Taxi 2 feature two new levels, four new cab drivers, a new gameplay element and new music tracks.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]  The brand new city of Crazy Taxi 2.  The player has a choice of four or eight (Four characters are unlockables) cab drivers; they're depended on speed and handling. The main objective of the game is to pick up a passenger and take him or her to his or her desire location at fast as possible. Many gameplay elements come into play, making the gameplay giving more depth than originally preceived. A new element was introduced in Crazy Taxi 2, the \"Crazy Hop,\" it's a jump mechanic that helps the player jump over huge traffic jams and get through short cuts. The player will start with fifty seconds, it can be increase once the player starts picking up costumers and dropping them off as fast as possible.  The game takes place in two cities that are heavily based on  New York. Costumers will be hanging around the city, waiting for the player to pick them up and take them to their desire location. There multiple types of costumers to pick up that are categorizes in different colors - it represents their difficulty. New to the series is the ability to pick up two to four costumers at once. A ranking will be to the player once the player drops off the costumers. Depending on how fast the player gets to the location that the costumers wants to get to, will determine the ranking. The \"Speedy\" rank will give the player an extra five seconds added to the game clock, the \"Normal\" rank will give the player an extra two seconds, and the \"Bad\" rank will give the player no extra time.  The player also must be careful on how to approach the costumer, if the player approaches too close, the costumer will run a few feet away from the player causing for a few seconds to wasted on the costumer getting into the cab. As a matter of fact, the cabbie will tell the costumer to hurry up and get in the car. Stunts can be perform in the game to earn more cash. The \"Crazy Through\" is a near miss, if the player passes by a car, the amount of money that will be giving to the player will be increase by fifty-cents. It will increase even further if the player keeps it up; as for multiple costumers, the bonuses can be multiple by the number of passengers the player has. The \"Crazy Drift\" is a drift mechanic that will help the in certain situations, the drift mechanic can be use to turn the cabbie 360 degrees  or earn more cash by drifting. The \"Crazy Boost\" is a boost mechanic, it will help the cabbie get to its maximum acceleration. Another new mechanic to the Crazy Taxi series, is the \"Crazy Hop,\" it is use to jump over huge traffic jams or jump on top of roof-tops (Short cuts).  The Crazy Hop in action.  The way both cities are built, defiantly makes good use of the crazy hop. An extensive amount of short-cuts all over the the two cities - which consist of jumping on roof-tops or jumping from one highway bridge to another, the player has to use the short-cuts in order to make it to the desire location on time. Memorization plays a big role in Crazy Taxi 2, the green arrow may be there to help the player navigate th e player, but if the player is familiar with the city, the player can take an alternate path to the desire location in order to save some time;  it's also helps when the player picks up multiple costumers.  Short-cuts can be obvious like the arrow pointing at a low roof-top, but it can be more complicated then that.  The four new characters of Crazy Taxi 2.  As soon as the player earns more cash, the more difficult the game will be, more costumers will give the player less time for the player to get the location that the costumer wants to get to, and traffic will increase (Cars will actually be parked on side-walks). Once the player starts receiving normal ranks or gets to the desire location not as fast as the player wanted to (Even when the speedy rank is given), the player will begin a downward spiral to the gameover screen. At first (If skilled) the player can have his or her timer on a strong one-hundred seconds or over, but then it will deteriorate, the player will soon start to struggle to keep his or her time on thirty seconds or less.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]D2 is the final game from Warp, Kenji Eno's development company, marking the developer's exit from the video game industry for 9 years until the release of You, Me & The Cubes for the Nintendo Wii in 2009. The game was released for the Dreamcast in Japan in 1999 in three separate special editions, Bliss, Hope and Eclipse, each with their own unique packaging that included a translucent plastic overlay and a calender for the year 2000, continuing Warp's trend for packing their games in interesting ways. A slightly censored version of the game was released in the United States a year later in 2000, but did not appear in the PAL market.The game is essentially an adventure game, with open-world exploration in a snowy environment along with exploration of interior locations for items and clues in a first-person viewpoint. The game can also be considered survival horror, for its mutated enemies, first-person shooting mechanics and horror storyline. While not explicitly stated, Kenji Eno was noticeably heavily inspired by Metal Gear Solid due to the nature of the complex plot and long cutscenes with personal monologues from the game's characters who have deep psychological damage. Hideo Kojima was thanked in the credits.Reception to the game was mixed. While reviewers praised the game's graphics and compelling plot, a lot of criticism was directed at the game's slow pacing, repetition in both exploration and combat as well as a lack of real difficulty due to the easy enemies and abundance of health items.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game follows Laura, who is traveling to visit her mother in Canada, before the passenger aircraft she is traveling in is both simultaneously hijacked by a group of cult terrorists and struck by a meteorite. Laura wakes up in a cabin in the wilderness under the care of Kimberly, where a week has apparently passed. Kimberly only discovered the unconscious body of Laura several days ago and Laura had been eating up to that point, so Laura must begin her investigation into what happened during that time. To make matters worse, survivors from the plane crash have now started mutating (or 'blossoming' as the characters refer to it) into horrific creatures and the only way to know if a person is infected is the color of their blood.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]ExplorationD2 features large, snowy open environments.The player moves through the game in large open environments, traveling to different locations such as research laboratories, mines, or old mansions. There is no fast travel and players must travel to their destination by foot, however in parts of the game the player has access to a snow-mobile which greatly reduces the travel time between locations. Inside locations, the game shifts to first-person where the player shifts to different parts of the room with the directional buttons where they can speak with characters, search for items or inspect or interact with certain objects to advance the story. This is identical to the gameplay seen in Warp's earlier titles D and Enemy Zero, but while the previous games used pre-rendered CG for these parts of the game, the environments in D2 are rendered in real-time. In the open environment and certain indoor locations, the player encounters the mutated enemies in the game.CombatCombat in D2 takes place in first-person, where the player is in a fixed position but can freely move their gun, and must kill monsters attacking them to move on. As enemies approach the player, they can rotate their field of view by 90 degrees in any direction by pressing the left and right directional buttons. Several weapons can be obtained throughout the game, with the weaker but generally reliable weapons having unlimited ammo but the more powerful weapons requiring ammo that can be found throughout the game's environments. After defeating all enemies, the player receives experience points and can move on. When the players have earned enough experience, they level up, increasing their health. Several boss battles exist, but the gameplay is generally the same, however the boss might attack the player in ways that shift their current position or line of sight.HuntingAn interesting gameplay mechanic in D2 is hunting for food, which can be used to restore health in or outside of combat. First-Aid Sprays exist in the game, but are not nearly as abundant as the animals that can be hunted, which makes hunting more desirable. Players are equipped with a scoped hunting rifle at the beginning of the game which is used to hunt animals such as rabbits, caribou, moose or birds. Unlike the combat in the game, hunting takes place in the world and as such the player can freely move around, but they must take care to not get too close to the animal because they will quickly escape if they detect danger. After successfully killing an animal, the player will acquire a certain amount of meat, with birds giving 1 meat, rabbits giving 2, caribou giving 3, and moose giving 4. The player will store the meat in their portable cooker, which can then be used any time during the game to restore health.[CR]Development[CR]A rare glimpse of the original version of D2D2 was originally in development for the successor to Panasonic's 3DO, the M2. The game was reportedly at least 50% completed with a preview trailer released, along with leaked gameplay footage that would eventually surface. The original game was a direct sequel to D, to focus on Laura Harris's son escaping a castle in Transylvania after being brought back to the past from the present day, transported directly out of her womb. With the cancellation of the M2, Kenji Eno decided to scrap all plans for the current game and instead focus on a new storyline, unrelated to the first game in the series. After completing Enemy Zero and Real Sound and waiting for Dreamcast development kits, Kenji Eno took his development team to New Zealand. He was highly drawn to the country's snowy environments and decided to replicate it for the new setting of the game. Shifting platforms, D2 became the first officially announced game for the Sega Dreamcast. It was also the first Dreamcast game (other than tech demos) to be shown publicly, showing the power of the system.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Kenji Eno is known for his soundtracks and while the previous game in the series, Enemy Zero, was composed by Michael Nyman, Eno composed the entirety of D2. The game is a mix between classical pieces and electronic music. The soundtrack was released in several different formats, with the aptly named D2 Sketches 1&2 featuring outtakes or drafts for music that would make it into the game. These were released in June 1998, more than a year before the release of the game. D2 Original Sound Track was released December 17 1999 at the released of the game. D2 Remixes was released at the same time and included remixes from electronic music composers such as Hardfloor, Coldcut and The Cinematic Orchestra. The latter's remix of The Fear Theme would later appear on their compilation album Remixes 98 - 2000 and due to the group's popularity, this composition has given Eno some recognition outside of his video game compositions.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio (known outside North America as Jet Set Radio) is an action rollerblading game developed by Smilebit and published by Sega for the Dreamcast on November 1, 2000. As a member of a group of roller-blading delinquents known as the GG's (Graffiti Gang, led by the young Beat), players must try to take over the cel-shaded streets of Tokyo-to by spraying graffiti, evading police, and one-upping each of the rival gangs. A sequel, titled JSRF: Jet Set Radio Future, was later developed and released for the Xbox on February 25, 2002, where the GG's must fight an oppressive mega-corporate enterprise to take back control of the streets.The game was originally released in June 29, 2000 in Japan. The international version (later released in Japan as De La Jet Set Radio) features two new maps (set in a place based on New York City), new songs, new characters, and other new content (including the ability to connect to the Internet to download and upload custom graffiti). A handheld version for the Game Boy Advance was produced by Vicarious Visions and published by THQ (Sega for the European version) on June 26, 2003, featuring isometric graphics and gameplay similar to their handheld Tony Hawk ports.A high-definition port of the original game (as Jet Set Radio) was released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam) on September 19, 2012. It will be released for the PlayStation Vita (also via PlayStation Network) on October 16, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio has the player controlling a roller blading graffiti artist and so there is the expected array of grind rails, half pipes, wall rides and jumps worked into the game world. However the layout is not like games such as the Tony Hawk series. The emphasis in Jet Set Radio is on using the various obstacles and your skating skills to reach taggable objects and then spray paint them in ridiculous, often mid-air style. Points are pushed more into the background with time limits creating the challenge. Tagging buses as you grind past them or bill boards as you back-flip over them is a common event.At first, the player will be dropped into an area of one of the cities of Tokyo-to. The player can skate around, earn some points by grinding on rails. If given enough speed, the player can perform tricks, the player can also wall ride to earn more points as well.But most of the player's time shouldn't be spent on just performing tricks, the player has a time limit to tag certain walls. First the player has to collect spray cans and get to a tagging location, by pressing the left trigger, the player will enter a quick time event. In the quick time event, the game will direct the player to perform certain motions on the analog stick. The player will accumulate more points when the player completes the motions on the analog stick.The more tags the player completes the more aggressive the police will get. This isn't a realistic games by any means and the cops will happily shut down the city in order to to kill vandals. Swat teams, Attack dogs and Tear gas are frequently employed. Players do not have any mechanism to defeat the police instead having to use the rail and the environment to outrun them.The DJ Professor K provides much of the narrative via the pirate radio station Jet Set Radio and gives you heads up on whats going on throughout the game. Additional roller blading degenerates are met throughout the game and recruited to your gang as playable characters.The game has multiple characters that the player can chose. Each character differs in terms of attributes such as, the amount of spray cans each character can hold, the amount of health they have, and the way each character handles.There are three versions of the spray cans that can be found in the stages:Yellow Spray Cans - 1 spray canBlue Spray Can - 5 spray cansRed Spray Can - Will restore health[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio features a total of five levels located in the various districts of Tokyo-to.Shibuya-ChoThe very first level of the game. The rival gang that owns Shibuya-Cho is the jilted Love Shockers.Benten-ChoThis area is owned by a gang known as the Noise Tanks, a group of otakus with a robot-like behavior.Kogane-ChoThis area is owned by the Poison Jam gang. Poison Jam are a group made up of horror movie fanatics.Bantam StreetA level that was added to the U.S release of the game. Bantam Street is loosely based off of an area in New York City.Grind SquareAnother level added to the U.S release of the game. Grind Square is based off of Times Square in New York City.Rokkaku Group BuildingThe game's final level takes place at the top of a large skyscraper in Tokyo-to.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]BeatGumTabMewGaramYo-YoCubeComboPiranhaSlatePotsLove ShockersPoison JamNoise TanksGoji[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio's funky and upbeat soundtrack was a big part in helping form the game's distinctive style. New songs were added in the North American and European releases of the game to cover more musical genres and round the soundtrack out. An American version of the soundtrack CD was released on September 18, 2012 by Sumthing Else Music Works to coincide with the re-release for digital platforms. However, the soundtrack only contains 10 songs from the original game with tracks composed by Hideki Naganuma and one track by Richard Jacques, along with 10 tracks from Jet Set Radio Future, all of which were composed by Hideki Naganuma.Japanese Soundtrack CDHumming the Baseline - Hideki NaganumaLet Mom Sleep - Hideki NaganumaMoody's Shuffle - Hideki NaganumaRock It On - Hideki NaganumaGrace and Glory - Hideki NaganumaSneakman - Hideki NaganumaSweet Soul Brother - Hideki NaganumaThat's Enough - Hideki NaganumaSuper Brothers - Guitar VaderMagical Girl - Guitar VaderMiller Ball Breakers - Deavid SoulOn the Bowl (A Fargus Remix) - Deavid SoulUp-Set Attack - Deavid SoulYappie Feet - Deavid SoulFunky Radio - B.B.

It made its debut in arcades in October 1999 and was released on      Dreamcast in February the following year, followed eight months later by a Playstation 2 launch. In 2004 it would be released for the  Xbox as  Dead or Alive Ultimate, which contained online play, and an upgrade in graphics and additional features.It was very popular and shortly after the release for the      Playstation 2, another version was released, it was called      Dead or Alive 2: Hardcore. Changes would include, added stages, more unlockable outfits, cutscene framerate increased from 30 to 60 Frames Per Second, as well as english voiceovers. A final update titled Dead or Alive 2: Hard*Core was released in Japan only and featured slight gameplay tweaks as well as more costumes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Bashing the opponent against a wall. Dead or Alive 2 followed the first one in terms of dangerzones and the tempo of the gameplay, it remained as fast and as twitchy all while improving graphics as well as character roster, and added character abilities. As well as new moves for the characters and the improved graphics Dead or Alive 2 was the first versus-fighting game to include walls on the various stages. Walls would stop you from knocking your opponent out of the ring (ala      Virtua Fighter), while still confining the fight to a small area. The game continued the      Rock-Paper-Scissors gameplay from the first title to stand out from the rest of the at the time popular fighting games (Tekken and Virtua Fighter). The Rock-Scissors-Paper system is still in use in the fourth release of Dead or Alive ( DOA4) on the      Xbox 360. In Dead or Alive, they introduced Offensive Holds (OH) which LOOKS like a Regular throw, but plays different. Offensive Holds executed when an opponent would strike you with a regular attack, would avoid the opponents attack and throw them, dealing damage in the process. Offensive Holds however, executed when an opponent would initiate a Regular Throw, would lose to the Throw and as a result you would be taking quite a bit of damage from their Throw. Regular Throws executed when an opponent would strike you with a normal attack would be ineffective, and you would take damage from their blow.Quickly described:Offensive Holds > Attacks > ThrowsThrows > Offensive Holds > AttacksAttacks > Throws > Offensive Holds[CR]Other Info[CR]DreamcastPlayers: 1 - 4VMU compatibleJump Pack compatibleArcade Stick compatible[CR]Character Roster[CR]     Ayane      Bass Armstrong      Bayman (cannot be used in Story Mode)      Ein      Gen Fu      Helena      Jann Lee      Kasumi      Lei Fang      Ryu Hayabusa      Tengu (Final boss, cannot be used in story mode)      Tina Armstrong      Zack [CR]",

During this, The Resistance is formed in an attempt to stop the SMO, lead by a woman by the name of Lily who is kidnapped when she attempts to help a man by the name of Kou.  After she is captured, it is learned the man has come into possession of two ancient pistols by the name of \"Crimson\" that can destroy the monsters and their vicious leader.  Kou sets out with Lily's daughter, Yuri, to bring her back and stop the evil forces within the city.[CR]Death Crimson is a light-gun game similar in style to House of the Dead where the player shoots at enemies that pop up on screen and save innocents from the monsters.  The player can also power-up the \"Crimson\" pistols by shooting death flowers that will turn their firepower into machine guns to decimate hordes of enemies.  There is also a health meter that will increase in size by successfully shooting enemies, gaining experience points.   Once enough points are obtained, the health bar will increase, however missing enemies or shooting civilians will take away points.",

It is considered a first person shooter, despite being vehicular based, drawing inspiration from Wing Commander for the PC. Like its predecessor, you are able to move freely in any direction as the entirety of the game takes place underwater. The game features 24 missions across two discs, and like Wing Commander, makes liberal use of Full Motion Video.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is put in the role of a new graduated private (callsign MORAY 2) from the Academy, a training institute for submarine pilots. The Academy is a part of a wholly underwater civilization which is under siege by enemy threats (the Shadowkin) and a seemingly natural disintegration of the environment. Ultimately, the goal is to aid the civilization develop a mother ship and then protect it in order to transport the entire society from these threats.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As noted, the core mechanic of the game is full 3D motion in a fluid, allowing for control much like Wing Commander and Descent. Throughout the course of the game, you pilot a series of 5 subs and an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) that are suited for a variety of tasks. One of the key gameplay elements is combat, which operates much like dogfights in a flight or space sim, often engaging numerous enemies with the aid of teammates. Battles are broken up by pathfinding, item collection, and puzzle solving, all of which are designed specifically around the idea of full 3D motion.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dino Crisis is a survival horror game for the PC, Dreamcast and PlayStation. Developed and published by Capcom in 1999, the game was developed by the same team that developed Resident Evil, with Shinji Mikami acting as director.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] & ControlsLaser grids can be used to keep attacking dinosaurs at bayDino Crisis is designed around a style of gameplay reminiscent of the survival horror Resident Evil entries, with many similarities including tank controls, a scarcity of ammo, and fixed camera angles that perpetuate throughout. However combat is made to be significantly more difficult and promotes the idea of flight rather than fight even more so than Resident Evil. The velociraptor dinosaurs the player will routinely encounter are much more durable than most enemies found in Resident Evil and can withstand more punishment. They can chase the player through multiple rooms should they opt to run away as well. If knocked over by a dinosaur, it is possible for Regina to drop her gun, forcing the player to recollect it for use.There are at least certain obstacles the player can use to help stop the advance of a dinosaur; there are firstly a number of laser grids the player will eventually be able to turn on or off at will. This may make exploration more difficult, but in the mean time will help keep a dinosaur at bay.Because of the scarcity of ammo and the aggressiveness of the dinosaurs, Dino Crisis also has available tranquiliser darts, that while it won't kill a dinosaur it will at least instantaneously put one to sleep for a varying amount of time. There are also poison darts that will outright kill a common dinosaur with a single shot, however they are extremely rare to obtain.Like Resident Evil, Dino Crisis includes many jump-scare momentsPlayers can of course choose between walking or running, however unlike in Resident Evil Regina must first go through a slight build up before reaching her maximum speed. Regina must also stay perched to the ground when firing, though she can at least move while readying her gun. Players cannot aim up or down manually, however Regina will instead aim as such when the situation calls for it, such as aiming downward at a sleeping velociraptor.Dino Crisis has the player coming across files and documents to help further the backstory or to possibly aid in solving one of the many puzzles throughout the game. However the files will not be archived in the player's inventory when read like in Resident Evil, and instead requires the player to manually jot down any notable passcodes or the like themselves.Inventory and MixingRegina can hold up to 10 consumable items such as healing supplies and ammunition, with a separate inventory menu for key items. As such the player will always have space for any such necessary keys and the like, and inventory management is governed purely around the player's supplies. Besides Regina's inventory, there are a number of Emergency Boxes that include a significant amount of supplies for the player to collect, while also offering a place for the player to leave unwanted supplies. However unlike the item boxes in Resident Evil, the boxes are color-coded and items can only persist across multiple boxes of the same color. Furthermore, they must first be unlocked with at least one item called a 'plug', otherwise it will be inaccessible.Mixing is the act of combining multiple supply types to increase their effectiveness. This typically revolves around mixing two small health packs to gain two medium ones for example, but it can also be used to enhance the strength of tranquilisers. Beyond mixing supplies together, there are also items that exist specifically to be mixed to increase an item's effectiveness.Health and SavingHealth works similarly to Resident Evil, however there is no formal indication of Regina's health, and players can only note her stance to read her condition. As Regina withstands more damage, she will begin to limp and hold onto her stomach, slowing her movement. There's also a strong chance for Regina to bleed after an attack, which will steadily decrease her health even further. The way to note if she's bleeding is if there are small puddles of blood that form under her feet per footstep.Should players ultimately die, there's a chance they will instead be taken back to the moment before they entered the room they died in, but only if they have a resuscitation kit on hand, otherwise they will fall back to a previous savepoint instead.The player is able to save the game indefinitely without the use of an item like in Resident Evil, though players must still first locate a Save Room to do so. Upon preparing to exit the Save Room they are then asked if they wish to save.Alternate PathsThe personalities of Rick and Gail will continually clash throughout the storyThroughout Dino Crisis, Regina will have to choose between two options usually revolving around the contrasting personalities of Gail and Rick. Should the player side with Gail they will typically resolve situations with combat, and siding with Rick would lead to solving a puzzle instead to potentially sidestep a combat encounter. Nearing the end, certain decisions could also determine the ending of the game and which characters would survive.There are three possible endings in total, none of which have ever been officially confirmed as the canon ending.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersReginaThe lead playable character for Dino Crisis. Sharp witted and lively, she is the team's infiltration expert.Voiced by Stephanie Morgenstern.RickThe intelligence specialist of the group. While Rick is hardly ever seen to use it, he is commonly found to be equipped with a sniper rifle suggesting his skills as a marksman.GailThe leader of the small team sent into apprehend Dr Kirk. Cold and ruthless, Gail continually exhibits a great deal of dedication to completing the mission at all costs, even at the risk of his own safety.Dr KirkThe scientist Regina and company have been sent to capture. Sociopathic and maybe even a little mad, he won't let anything get in the way of his goals.PlotMain characters Regina, Rick, and GailA special forces team is sent to Ibis Island, a government facility. Their goal is to investigate reports that an undercover weapons project is being conducted by Dr. Edward Kirk, a world-renowned scientist, assumed to have died two years ago. It becomes apparent that Kirk was running experiments to bring dinosaurs back from extinction, the government facility is in ruins, and has fallen to the wrath of the dinosaurs. You take on the role of Regina, the game's key protagonist, as she struggles to infiltrate the facility, and discover the truth behind Kirk's dangerous experiment. Accompanied to the island by Gail, Rick, and Cooper; Regina forms part of the Secret Operation Raid Team (SORT), and must find and apprehend Kirk while destroying the infestation that has spread throughout the facility, killing a large number of Kirk's scientists in the ongoing bloodbath.Arriving on the island where Kirk is rumored to be located, they make their way on plane leading to all four members jumping to the surface below via parachute. While Regina, Rick and Gail successfully touchdown close by the facility, Cooper is split up from the team though mid-flight and is devoured by a roaming T-Rex. As they make their way into the facility, Gail uncovers a corpse that has been mauled viciously. Presuming it was a wild animal, they deem it with no suspicion and carry on. Regina investigates the power circuit ordered by Gail while he stays by the corpse keeping a watch for the attacker. After turning on the power, Regina hears a scream and rushes out to find Gail and the corpse missing, with a large trail of blood leading back to the entrance where they first landed. Regina cautiously makes her way back to the entrance to rendezvous with Rick. Along the way she is ambushed by a velociraptor. At first in shock she watches as it jumps down towards her. Soon she regains herself and makes her escape to the entrance eventually losing the Raptor. Rick has already headed to the control room with Regina radioing about what's been happening. Rick skeptical over the situation asks her to meet up with him.Fighting her way through more velociraptors, she eventually makes it to the control room, with Rick informing her of spotting the dinosaurs via the security camera's. Still no sign of Gail, Rick suggests that the mission be already scrapped and that they head home for Regina to intersect that its their priority to find Kirk and that's what Gail would of ordered. Rick opts to stay behind and make use of the facilities in the control room, making use of his tech-skills while Regina heads out alone to search for Dr Kirk and now the missing Gail.Regina looking down on her latest kill.With the help from Rick, Regina is able to bypass the many laser grids set up around the facility and learn more about Kirk's schemes amidst this facility through the occasional survivor, who would unfortunately die soon after Regina comes into contact. One such incident with a survivor also has Regina introduced to the same T-Rex that killed their teammate Cooper.Eventually Regina locates Gail who is in good health, and like Regina anticipated has no desire to end the mission even with the current dinosaur crisis they are in the middle of. Gail decides to have him and Regina split up rather than stay together to cover more ground with Rick still acting as their radio support from the CR. Heading to the outside region of the facility, Regina will come across Tom, their undercover contact who supplied them with the information regarding Kirks possible terrorist motives. He is badly wounded however and even with the help of Rick coming to give shooting assistance, is killed by a velociraptor. Rick feels tremendous guilt over Tom's death and decides to keep himself in the CR where he'll be most useful.Gail and Regina eventually come into contact with Kirk, with Gail cornering him in a supply depot. Gail orders Regina to head back to the control room while Gail will escort him personally. Gail hands Regina a special type of key to unlock an exclusive elevator in the CR to get them to their extraction point. It however requires power and Regina heads to restore it. Along the way the notorious T-Rex will make another unwelcome appearance and attack Regina. She rushes away and manages to head to the extraction point with Rick and Kirk waiting. Gail has mysteriously vanished. Their helicopter arriving, the T-Rex once more crashes the party and downs their helicopter allowing Kirk for one to make a quick getaway and forcing Regina to hold off the T-Rex while Rick activates a nearby elevator to get them to the lower levels. Arriving at the lower levels safely, they fall into familiar territory with Regina heading out looking for clues, Gail missing and Rick staying behind in a security room to help via radio and offer technical support. Regina will once more come into contact with Gail with him feeding the excuse that he lost Kirk amidst a dinosaur ambush and was trying to regain him. Regina goes along with it and follows Gail's orders to hunt down Kirk. Throughout her search amidst the lower levels she will learn more and more about Kirk's nefarious schemes involving some sort of dimensional portal that malfunctioned bringing the dinosaurs into our time. Heading through some of the more higher-profile areas, Regina will locate multiple complex machines and even the ''Third Energy'' contraption itself.Regina encounters the T-Rex for the first time.Regina manages to locate Kirk amidst his own secret office, she radios Gail and Rick with Gail stating he's on his way and Rick mentioned of located a new means of escape via a hoverboat. Kirk explains all about what happened concerning the Third Energy theory and its accidental switching of time and space with the dinosaur generation. The Third Energy movement is upon their objectives to be destroyed, Kirk reluctantly explains how to do so and Regina makes her way to the machines pulling all the strings to turning the giant contraption off. Gail stays behind to watch Kirk. Once the machine is turned off it enters a self destruct mode simultaneously with the T-Rex makings its way closer to the area. Some fallen rubble off the ceiling landing on Gail allows Kirk to escape once more. Regina comes upon Gail and ignores his plea to find Kirk and carries him to where Rick is stationed. With all the doors open thanks to the keys supplies by Kirk, they plan to make their escape only for Gail to still stand by his orders and make his way out to find Kirk even through his severe injuries. Rick asks Regina to go get him while he makes sure everything is ready by the time she gets back.Regina heading out for Gail stumbles upon him with Kirk. It is then revealed that Gail was so concerned over Kirk's capture was down to his own hidden objective about finding out how to create another Third Energy machine with Kirk's ''assistance'' Regina is initially appalled at this. Gail slowly dies there after uttering his true motives. Regina decides to still bring Kirk along as its still one of her own objectives.The T-Rex once again proving to be an oversized thorn in Regina's side.Finally, Regina, Kirk and Rick board the hovercraft and make their way out of a cave. The T-Rex makes one final attempt however with Regina fortunately blasting it away with a grenade launcher allowing it to get caught in the blast from the self-destruction of the facility. The mission is deemed a success with Regina voicing a brief outline of the mission outcomes noting Gail and Tom as deceased, Cooper MIA and Kirk captured.[CR]Extra Crisis[CR]Regina wearing her camo costume amidst the Extra Crisis minigame.As is common with the majority of Capcom's titles, Dino Crisis has an unlockable minigame available to play once the main game has been completed. Titled Extra Crisis, the player's goal is to try and rack up a high score through killing as many dinosaurs as possible in the time limit. The weapons are scarce, however, and must be procured from searching around the facility. Regina is the only playable character, but she may be fitted with any of the unlockable costumes available from the main game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack for Dino Crisis was released in Japan and North America in 1999. It was composed by Makoto Tomozawa, Sayaka Fujita and Akari Kaida. Like Resident Evil, the soundtrack creates an atmosphere with a sense of dread and urgency. The game's save room music \"Set You At Ease\", much like the aforementioned game, features music that is designed to calm the player.Track ListingDino Crisis Original SoundtrackName: Dino Crisis Original SoundtrackTotal length: 69:51\"DINO CRISIS\" - 0:27\"You Have Mail\" - 1:42\"Welcome to Genocide Island\" - 1:44\"An Omen\" - 0:11\"An Encounter\" - 1:16\"The Place Is Deserted Through...\" - 1:31\"Breakout\" - 0:38\"Set You At Ease\" - 0:50\"Entrance\" - 0:15\"At The Verge of Attack\" - 0:37\"Rush Into\" - 0:18\"A Rowdy In Ancient Ages\" - 1:14\"A Rescue Or A Mission\" - 1:33\"Where's The Doc\" - 1:07\"Doctor Kirk!\" - 0:08\"Investigate The Underground\" - 1:01\"Murderers In The Sky\" - 0:57\"Where's The Survivor\" - 1:44\"The Wounds Are Pretty Bad...\" - 0:46\"Be Hanged And Dropped\" - 0:14\"Lamentation\" - 0:22\"Pounced\" - 0:41\"Lab In The Underground\" - 1:47\"A Secret In The Poisonous Gas\" - 0:40\"Confined\" - 0:57\"Make Your Choice\" - 1:46\"Elusive Dr. Kirk\" - 2:13\"To The Communication Room\" - 0:53\"Giant Fang Bites\" - 0:57\"Get To The Heliport\" - 1:13\"Abandoned Hope\" - 0:51\"Hang In There\" - 0:46\"Underpass\" - 0:50\"Dark And Deserted\" - 1:45\"Heading For The Port\" - 1:10\"Giant Claws\" - 1:12\"Further Dread\" - 0:35\"Call From Survivor\" - 0:41\"The Violence Comes Down\" - 0:32\"Distorted Space-Time Continuum\" - 0:57\"Seek For The Generator\" - 0:41\"Located Main Generator\" - 1:16\"Suspicious Shot\" - 1:11\"Glimpse\" - 0:07\"The Tragedy Arisen From The Experiment\" - 2:50\"What's Your Choice\" - 1:12\"Stabilizer And Initializer\" - 2:18\"A Wiretrap\" - 0:45\"Starting Up\" - 0:37\"There's No Turning Back\" - 1:06\"Overloaded\" - 0:38\"Breath Faintly\" - 0:25\"Last Selection\" -1:52\"Stick to the Belief\" - 0:43\"A Fierce Fight At Port\" - 0:55\"Explosion\" - 1:26\"Hidden Purpose\" - 2:34\"Lie Down\" - 0:28\"The One Who Chase\" - 1:04\"Final Battle\" - 1:08\"At The Waterway\" - 1:28\"A Chopper\" - 0:18\"Finally Caught\" - 0:29\"Troublesome And Ferocious\" -1:27\"Burn Away\" - 1:14\"Reminiscence\" - 2:27[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is a game based on the movie of the same name and was developed by Traveller's Tales Ltd. and published by Activision for the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PC and Sega Dreamcast. A Game Boy Color port of the game was also developed by Tiertex Design Studios and the publishing of the port was handled by THQ.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is a traditional style 3D platformer in which players take upon control of protagonist Buzz Lightyear as he attempts to rescue his best friend Woody after he is kidnapped by the evil Al McWhiggin.As is typical with the genre players have access to both a single and double jump and have to variations of attack to defeat the various enemies and bosses scattered throughout the game. The first form of attack utilises Buzz's wrist layer and fires a single projectile to damage enemies. This can be done from either the third or first person perspective as the game allows players to make precision shots from a first person viewpoint. The second of Lightyears' attacks is a spin attack to damage enemies with his pop out wings. Both of these attacks may also be charged resulting in a more powerful form of the attack although charging the spin move will leave players vulnerable for a short period of time after its execution. The game also features 5 different power-ups which are needed to help players complete certain tasks and these are permanently unlocked to be used in other levels once players recover one of Mr Potato Head's missing body pieces during the first level of each zone. The five power-ups are:Cosmic Shield - a shield which protects Buzz from damage and hazards in the environment.Disk Launcher - the disk launcher helps to defeat enemies in the harder to reach places.Rocket Boots - these give Buzz a speed boost for a short period of time.Grappling Hook - this allows Buzz to reach high places.Hover Boots - these allow Buzz to hover for a brief moment in order to reach specific platforms.Finally scattered throughout the stages often on harder to reach platforms are limited use upgrades such as a more powerful laser upgrade which increases the damage of the laser attack but comes with a limited amount of potential shots.The game contains 15 levels in total split into 5 zones consisting of 3 levels per zone (which follow the pattern of two objective based levels followed by a boss level). The gameplay centres around collecting Pizza Planet tokens to advance onto further levels in the game and although there contains five tokens per stage only one is required to progress onto the next level in the game and a set number of tokens being required in order to access the boss stage at the end of each zone.The five ways to unlock the Pizza Planet tokens within each stage are:Collecting 50 coins for Hamm.Finding 5 of Bo-Peep's lost sheep.Defeating RC Car in a race or completing Slinky's time trial challenge.Solving a puzzle or reaching a typically hard to reach location.Defeating a mini-boss within the stage.Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me.As previously alluded to on the first level of each zone Mr Potato Head appears requesting Buzz recover a missing body part of his, rewarding the player with one of the five aforementioned possible power-ups for doing so. Obtaining these power-ups are essential to collecting all of the tokens within the game as several of the tokens are only obtainable using specific power-ups.Finally Buzz's dinosaur pal Rex provides advice and hints about the current level and tells players where in the level they can find the mini-boss to defeat in order to obtain the token awarded for doing so.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Example level select screen.Andy's HouseAndy's NeighbourhoodBombs Away!

(Boss Level)Airport InfiltrationTarmac TroubleProspector Showdown! (Boss Level)[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]It's not flying, its falling with style.The game's plot follows that of the film pretty closely and like the film begins with the kidnapping of Woody by evil collector Al McWhiggin outside of Andy's house. The game then follows Buzz Lightyear and his companions as they set out to rescue the captured cowboy as the traverse the nearby neighbourhood, Al's Toy Barn, Al's penthouse and finally the airport terminal and tarmac at the film's end.Unlike the film however the game closes after Buzz Lightyear defeats Stinky Pete (aided by two henchmen) in a final battle, contrary to the films actual ending. [CR]Differences Between Versions[CR]There are many noticeable differences across the different versions of the game. This includes the game having a different soundtrack across the multiple platforms on which it was released. An example would be the first level of the game (Andy's House) which featured a unique soundtrack in the PS1, Dreamcast and PC release of the game. The N64 release though featured significantly different audio from the other versions of the game most likely due to the hardware differences between the various consoles.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Skies of Arcadia is a role-playing game for the Dreamcast, released in Japan on October 5, 2000 as Eternal Arcadia. In the US it was released as Skies of Arcadia on November 13, 2000. It was developed by Overworks (subsequently known as Sega WOW) and published by Sega. Skies of Arcadia: Legends was a port of the Dreamcast version and featured 24 new discoveries, a new sub-plot featuring a character named Piastol, a new bounty system that rewarded the player for defeating typically new optional bosses and a few extra weapons and items.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story centers around Vyse, a young man who wishes to travel the air as a sky pirate. His father is the captain of the pirate crew, the Blue Rogues. As the group sails through the skies, they run into a warship of the Valuan Empire attacking a young girl's ship, so they decide to take advantage of the distracted ship and raid it. Vyse and his companion Aika board the ship in search of valuables, but they run into Fina, the mysterious girl who was being attacked. They rescue her and the Blue Rogues head back to Pirate Island, their headquarters.After they land, Vyse, Aika, and Fina see a stone fall to a nearby island and decide to investigate. When they return, they find that the Valuan army has attacked their home in retribution, and have captured many of their friends and family. Now the three companions must find a way to break into the Valuan Empire, rescue their friends, and find out why Fina is so important to their enemies.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Skies of Arcadia offers fairly standard turn-based RPG combat: it has physical attacks, spells, and special attacks unique to each character. Players choose the action they will take before a turn and then watch the characters and the enemies alternate turns attacking each other. Character agility and attack choices effect the order in which the characters will take turns. The gameplay mechanic that sets this system apart from other rpg's is that there is one pool of energy that the whole party can draw upon to perform magic and special abilities. This brings a new dynamic to the fights since you have to think ahead about what moves you are going to use. Alternatively, each player can perform a focus action to add \"spirit points\" to the group and can more easily access super moves or a special crew attack when you fill up the pool. It is also important to keep your party alive as when a character is unconscious that characters \"spirit points\" are no longer added to the pool at the beginning of the players turn, limiting player options.Another aspect that this game shares with other rpg's is the idea that the enemies have weakness to certain elements. In the game you gain access to different crystals imbued with elements as you progress through the story. You are allowed to change the elements of your weapon at any time during the fight without any penalty. This allows the player to change up their strategy on the fly and gain the upper hand when fighting bosses of regular monster. When you finished fight you will get points based on the element set to your weapon at the end of the fight. The characters also get a smaller fraction of points if someone else in your party has their weapon set to a different element. This is the basic magic system of the game, each color corresponds to a certain element.Red- Fire, increase strengthGreen-Healing magic, poisonBlue- Water/Wind magic, increase speedPurple- Ice magic, can cast silence to negate special/magic attacksYellow- Lightning magic, can lower enemy defenseSilver- Life and Death magicBattles In The Sky!Skies of Arcadia also features a airship-to-airship battle system, which are a fusion on the turn based combat that is featured in Skies of Arcadia with some interesting elements borrowed from strategy rpg's. These battle are heavily dependent on planning ahead as victory is often dependent on landing multiple attacks to strike at the same time. For example, you could launch a torpedo to hit in three rounds then shoot a gun that hits for two rounds, so on the third round when you shoot your regular guns you also land the torpedoes you fired before, letting you score massive damage on your enemy.You can also customize your air ship with better weapons as well as gather crew members for your ship which will give it bonus features that can be called upon in combat. Another feature of the airship combat is the ability to perform a special attack. These special attacks can only be called upon once you get your ship into the right position as well as have enough points to perform the attack. This requires the player to out maneuver the enemy to get into position.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Airship battles have serious consequencesThese Character descriptions are based upon the Character introductions given in the Skies of Arcadia Legends manual.Vyse: Young Pirate who dreams of grasping the limits of the skies. The main character of Skies of Arcadia. A young boy of the Blue Rogues. Handles two cutlasses with both hands. Full of curiosity, and very fearless. Quote: \"One day, I shall see what lies beyond the clouds, the so-called limits of the world.\"Aika: A bright, ever-cheerful girl, who trusts and takes actions with Vyse at any time. A childhood friend of Vyse who rides on the same Pirate ship. Straightforward and frank, she will clearly say whatshe likes and what she doesn't like, but her Pirate friends admire her agility and skill with the boomerang. Quote: \"Friends and treasures, which shall I take? Why both, of course.\"Fina: A girl from a foreign world. Quiet, but with a strong will and a kind heart. A girl who, with certain events, becomes involved with Vyse and his friends. She is very quiet, but the smile she shows at times makes you feel her kind heart. She wears clothes from a foreign world, not even Vyse knows where she is from.Cupil: A mysterious creature who is always with Fina. A mysterious creature that can change its shape at will. It appears to be a friend of Fina from her childhood. Normally it is in the shape of a bracelet. But during a battle, Cupil changes its shape to a weapon, such as a sword, to attack the enemies and to protect Fina.Drachma: An old, lonesome sailor with a vendetta. An old sailor that Vyse meets during his adventure. Long ago he lost his eye and arm to a huge arcwhale called Rhaknam, and ever since he has made capturing Rhaknam his only purpose in life. His experience as a sailor is excellent and he is very skilled at his trade. But with his blunt and cantankerous, he continues to sail alone on his ship \"Little Jack.\" Quote: \"My sole purpose is to capture Rhaknam.\"There are three total characters who take up the fourth party member position in Skies of Arcadia. Drachma is the first of these and he shares this position with Gilder and Enrique. Drachma is the fourth party member for an early portion of the game, Gilder is the fourth party member for the large mid-portion of the game and the last section, and Enrique is the fourth party member for the mid-end portion of the game.Just like Enrique, Drachma's time with the group is an excuse to give the player an airship for a short period of time. Drachma freely lets Vyse and the group use their ship, although Drachma is still the captain. Drachma leaves the party early and frequently.Drachma shows up at the end of the game, just before the final boss and can rejoin the party as an optional fourth member.Little Jack: The middle size ship that Captain Drachma has sailed with for many years. The ship itself is an old model, but the armor and cannons have been strengthened to be able to battle against large battleships and, of course, Rhaknam.Gilder: Easy-going Pirate in chase of \"the good life.\" Captain of the Pirate ship \"Claudia,\" with free life as his motto. He wanders the skies in search of vast treasures, beautiful women and of course excitement. He is a light-hearted soul whose not afraid to crack jokes in the most dire of situations. But in reality, other Pirates and the Valuan forces recognize his skills as a warrior and a leader. Quote: \"Only four of us against a hundred of them, huh... Sounds like fun. Count me in!Gilder is the first \"final\" party member you get after Drachma originally leaves the group. At the time that Drachma is still in the group he lets Vyse, Fina, and Aika use his ship \"Little Jack\". Once Drachma finally leaves he leaves with his ship, as he finally found Rhaknam and he realizes that it is his life goal to capture him. Once Gilder originally joins the party he is the longest lasting member of the group, and although his first time with the group is the largest of any 4th party member, he is also gone for a large section of the mid-game as well.During the original Gilder portion of the game, before the party meets Enrique and gets the Delphinus as their core ship, the party is not in possession of an airship so they mostly deal with on land conflicts in the story. Gilder leaves shortly after the beginning of the first disc, where he gets separated from the core three in an airship crash. He reappears in the last portion of the game, being the games true and final fourth member.During the original Gilder portion of the game, before the party meets Enrique and gets the Delphinus as their core ship, the party is not in possession of an airship so they mostly deal with on land conflicts in the story.

The Empress of the Valuan Empire. With a strong lust for conquest and exclusive possession, she has the ambition to conquer the Skies of Arcadia..

Quote: \"All the Nations of the world shall kneel before me!\"Enrique: The Prince of the Empire, a man with a strong sense of justice. The son of Empress Teodora, the Prince of the Valuan Empire. In the militarily obsessed nation of Valua, he insists on maintaining friendly relationships with the other nations of Arcadia.

I'll kill you with my improved ship!\"[CR]Downloadable Content[CR]The Dreamcast version of Skies of Arcadia made use of the built-in modem of the system, featuring three pieces of downloadable content. The first download added an airship battle with a giant version of a looper. The second download placed a new island in the game, where the last cham in the game was found. Only those who had the downloadable content to get this cham could unlock the final form of Fina's pet, Cupil. The third download added two new weapons to the game, available from a merchant. These were the Tuna Cutlass for Vyse, basically a sword that looked like a fish, and the Swirlmerang for Aika, a boomerang with the Dreamcast swirl logo. All the downloadable content was included in the Gamecube version, Skies of Arcadia: Legends.[CR]Mini-Game[CR]In the Dreamcast version of Skies of Arcadia, one could download a mini-game to a Dreamcast VMU called \"Pinta's Quest\" after meeting the character Pinta in the game. This VMU game could be played independently from the main game. Pinta's Quest included various random encounters, requiring players to complete mini-game objectives for experience, points, and items. The VMU game could be synced back into the full game for gold and the chance at rare items. The experience points gained would then level up the ship used in the Pinta's Quest. This mini-game was not included in the Gamecube version, Skies of Arcadia: Legends.[CR]",

Ash and his girlfriend, Jenny, decide to return to the  cabin in the  woods where the whole  Evil Dead ordeal began to try and end the nightmares. Once there Ash runs into his possessed hand that he had previously lobbed off. The hand turns on the  tape recorder with the incantation to make the Deadites rise and all hell breaks loose. Ash must find the  pages of the Necronomicon to send the Deadites back \"once-and-for-all\".  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Evil Dead: Hail to the King plays very much like an early  Resident Evil game with the real-time action happening over pre-rendered and  fixed camera scenes. Ash is controlled much like a  tank with the left and right directions turning him rapidly and the forward and back moving him backwards.  Combat involves the use of melee weapons and ranged weapons to kill the various Deadites that appear. One of the buttons on the controller is reserved for  taunting with Ash's catchphrases such as \"Come get some!\" You are able to performing finishing blows on enemies, picking up with your chainsaw and using your secondary weapon to deal a fatal blow.The game is additionally notable for Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. [CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]There are five weapons in the game, four of which can be upgraded. These include the trademark Evil Dead weapons of a chainsaw and a 'boomstick' (a double barrelled shotgun), as well as a pistol, axe and rifle. You always have the chainsaw equipped in one hand, while the other can be switched out for any of the other weapons. However, you need to refuel the chainsaw with gas periodically.[CR]",

It focuses solely on the Ferrari F355 and provides some car set-up options such as cambers, right heights, toe, stabilisers, LSD, and wings. The game was developed by Sega-AM2. It was originally released into arcades in 1999, then in 2000 it was ported to the Dreamcast and in 2002 to the PS2.It was considered the most accurate simulation of the Ferrari F355 possible up until that time; its focus on realism was considered unusual for an arcade game at the time. The realism was further heightened by the sit-in cabinet, with a simulated Ferrari dashboard, force feedback, and three screens increasing the field of vision.[CR]Arcade[CR]Some versions of the arcade cabinet were noteworthy for having three display monitors allowing the player to look through the side windows as if they were in a real car. The 3-screen cabinet version also featured an H-shaped gear stick and 3 foot pedals.

It focuses solely on the Ferrari F355 and provides some car set-up options such as cambers, right heights, toe, stabilisers, LSD, and wings. The game was developed by Sega-AM2. It was originally released into arcades in 1999, then in 2000 it was ported to the Dreamcast and in 2002 to the PS2.It was considered the most accurate simulation of the Ferrari F355 possible up until that time; its focus on realism was considered unusual for an arcade game at the time. The realism was further heightened by the sit-in cabinet, with a simulated Ferrari dashboard, force feedback, and three screens increasing the field of vision.[CR]Arcade[CR]Some versions of the arcade cabinet were noteworthy for having three display monitors allowing the player to look through the side windows as if they were in a real car. The 3-screen cabinet version also featured an H-shaped gear stick and 3 foot pedals.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Fur Fighters is a Third-person action/adventure/shooter hybrid developed by Bizzare Creations and Published by Acclaim. The Game was originally for the SEGA Dreamcast, but was later ported over to the PC, and given a slight update for the PS2. The premise of the game is simple: The evil General Viggo is tired Tweekof having his plans foiled by the titular \u2018Fur Fighters\u2019, a small rebel force of animals who vow to protect the world and those that inhabit it, and so he concocts a foolproof plan to put them out of action- Steal their families and hold them hostage. Unfortunately for the evil Viggo, the remaining Fur Fighters of the village aren\u2019t going to take this lying down. With a little help from General Bristol, once the leader of the Fur Fighters but now reduced to ghost form, and the personal fitness trainer, Sergeant Sternhouser, the Fur Fighter team set off to rescue their families and take Viggo down in the process.The game is played from a third person perspective similar to games such as Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie, but features a multitude of firearms to add some shooting action into the mix. Despite featuring a large amount of shooting gameplay, the game also manages to fit in lots of platform and adventure game elements, such as expansive worlds to explore, and a fair bit of running and jumping. The 6 characters, of who can be switched between at many points during levels, each feature a unique ability, which vary from Tweek the dragons ultra-useful gliding, to Roofus the dog\u2019s burrowing ability, which is only required at a few points in the game, and at all other times is strictly useless. Due to a faulty teleporter, only one Fur Fighter can be in action at any one time.General ViggoFur Fighters features cute, cartoony graphics (with full-on cell-shading in the PS2 remake) which accompany its non-serious attitude well. Despite the fact the game features pumping lead into a range of (most likely now endangered) animals, the fact they simply explode into a ball of fluff upon death highlights the fact that the game doesn\u2019t focus on violence. Combined with the catchy, up-beat music which dynamically changes depending on character used, the graphics help create a friendly tone for the game, even though it is packed with weapons, death (well, \u2018fluffs\u2019) and destruction. From the ReadMe of the PC version: \u201c[Fur Fighters is] intended to be a glorious example of what legal fun can be had with small furry animals....please enjoy it and don't abuse it. Thanks.\" Which sums the game up perfectly. Characters Viggo only left behind 6 Fur Fighters in the village, and these are the playable characters of the game. Each has their own unique ability. As well as this, the instruments and style of the music changes slightly depending on the currently selected character. The characters are: Roofus the HoundRoofus the HoundA pup born and raised in the Dog Kennels of Glasgow, Roofus joined the Fur Fighters to fight. Turning down all promotions, instead choosing to fight on the front lines with his team, Roofus can burrow at preset points in the game, opening up new areas. When playing as Roofus, the music takes on a more military like tone, and makes use of drums as well as that Scottish symbol, bagpipes.Bungalow the KangarooBungalow the KangarooA fully grown Australian kangaroo, Bungalow is a bit of a dolt. He often has no idea what is going on, but that doesn\u2019t mean his heart isn\u2019t in the right place; he will do anything it takes to preserve freedom, so long as it doesn\u2019t involve too much thinking. Being a \u2018roo, Bungalow can jump over twice as high as any other Fur Fighter, making him invaluable in traversing terrain, or simply jumping over enemies. When Bungalow is being used, the music becomes more laid back, and the key melody is played on traditional Australian instruments, such as DidgeridoosJuliette the CatJuliette the CatThe only female member after Gwyneth is kidnapped by Viggo, Juliette ticks many of the stereotype boxes any self respecting team. Loner? Check. Fashion Conscious? Check. Occasionally a bit of a renegade? You bet. Brought up on the chic streets of , Juliette is a French Cat (in every sense of the word), and can use her claws to climb specially designed areas in the game. On top of this, Juliette is one of the fastest runners and jumpers. Juliette\u2019s take on the music is distinctly French, and slightly jazzy. Instruments used include the flute and Piano. Rico the PenguinRico the Rockhopper PenguinRico left his home islands of in search of a life of adventure. The Fur Fighter team seemed perfect to him, and he quickly signed up and became a valued member of the team. Rico makes up for being totally suck-tacular on land by being an adept swimmer, being the only member who can dive underwater. His musical style takes on a slight Spanish flavour, and makes use of Spanish guitars amongst other instruments to form the upbeat version of the levels music whenever playing with him.Change the Firefox Chang the FirefoxThis height-challenged Firefox horrified his honorable Chinese family by joining the Fur Fighters. He makes up for his lack of humour with a strong sense of justice and honour, which he upholds during his work. His small statue allows him to crawl into the smallest of places, and uncover the secrets within. The background music when playing as Chang can only be described as \u2018Oriental\u2019.Tweek the DragonThe newest member of the team, tweak has only been alive a single day. His mother, Gwyneth, was a former member of the team, but realising was a powerful force she was, Viggo kidnapped her along with the rest of the Fur Fighter\u2019s families, leaving Tweek instead. Fortunately, Tweek was born with an extensive knowledge of firearms. Tweek comes with the ability to glide using his underdeveloped wings, meaning he can reach areas others can\u2019t. The music that accompanies Tweek features vocals instead of instruments, much like scat music. [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR] Years ago, a small yet highly trained rebel group of elite, yet cute and cuddly animals, otherwise referred to as the \u2018Fur Fighters\u2019, brought the evil Viggo to Justice. With their greatest foe behind bars, the team retired to an idyllic seaside village where they could live out the rest of their days in peace. Until one night, years later, the evil General Viggo finally escapes, and begins to enact the plan he has been planning for years. Striking under cover of night, General Viggo launches a full-on assault against the unprepared and unexpectant Fur Fighter village, complete with huge battleships and attack jets. Caught unawares, the Fur Fighters have no chance to retaliate, and are quickly subdued by a powerful sleeping gas sprayed down upon the village by planes flying above. Though Viggo would like nothing more then to kill every last Fighter now they are unconscious, he has learnt from his past mistakes and instead captures all but 6 in the hope the remaining would simply sit back and not interfere in his latest immoral scheme. Unfortunately, the fact their families have been kidnapped just strengthens the remaining sixes\u2019 resolve to stop Viggo further, and so they embark on their most important mission yet, rescuing their families and uncovering what Viggo really has planned. [CR]World[CR] The world of Fur Fighters is broken up into around a half dozen of distinct areas, which in turn comprise of 3 stages and a boss battle. Each area also features a \u2018hub\u2019, which links together the stages in the area, as well as providing access back to . The fur fighters must collect enough of their kidnapped babies and then defeat an area\u2019s boss (usually a brainwashed family member) before ultimately progressing to Viggo-a-GoGo, Viggo\u2019s doman, and defeating Viggo once and for all. Each Area reveals part of the story and more of General Viggo\u2019s master plan. The fur fighter is the idyllic home of the Fur Fighters, and as such provides little threat for the team. Cute rabbits and other small, cuddly animals abound, as the cool sea breeze meets the warmth of the sun. Within the walls of the village are the houses of the six Fur Fighters which gradually get more and more populated as the game progresses, and the Undermill, the lower workings of a mill converted to house various training facilities for the team to use. The Undermill is where the tutorial takes place, and each character can re-acquaint themselves with their specific abilities. A shotgun can be obtained fairly early on here, as if 2 bags of flower are destroyed a grate opens revealing the weapon. New Quack CityNew Quack City Load ScreenA large urban city which takes more then a few design cues from it\u2019s real life counter part, . The area of New Quack Cities encompasses the , Lower East Quack and The Quachenheim Museum. Viggos ultimate plan for the city is to steal the world\u2019s largest pair of Diamond Earrings held in The Quachenheim Museum. As the Earrings are roughly 10 times the size of the characters in the game, Viggo plans to first distract the police by causing havoc in Lower East Quack and seize control of the World Quack Centre so that he can take the Earrings unopposed. Beaver PowerBeaver Power Load ScreenHaving his plan foiled in , Viggo moves his sights to Beaver Power, a large company in the valleys just outside Fur Fighter, set up to harness the power of the water in the area. The areas main feature is a large dam designed to generate huge amounts of electricity from the rapidly flowing waters. Other key areas include , a secluded, well, forest, abundant with wildlife that is being chopped down by beaver power, and , where huge machines are trying to unearth a secret. Viggo wants control of the of the companies powerful machines to try and unearth a secret in the ground. He also wants control of the surrounding areas, including the huge Dam itself, to provide him with enough power to carry out his plans. Just what is it that Viggo is trying to dig up? The next port of call for the intrepid team is , where they\u2019ve chased Viggo into space. His plans include taking control of space station meer for his own despicable uses, and the only way to stop him is to take off into space itself. Before this, however, the team must Visit the , where they use the aid of powerful machines to assemble their own rocket, the VLF Facility where they must prep for their journey into space, and the Space Station Meer itself. DinotopolisDinotopolis Load ScreenIt turns out the secret Viggo was digging for in Beaver Power was non other then Dinotopolis, a super advanced land inhabited by dinosaurs, no less. Contained within are artifacts of extremely advanced technology which Viggo plans to take for himself and put to his own use, and if he can brainwash a few dinosaurs to his cause along the way, then all the better. Dino Upstairs, Downstars and the Rumpus room are all available to be annexed by the Fur Fighters, and that\u2019s exactly what they must do if they want to continue their quest to stop Viggo. ANATAT TATANATATOtherwise known as \u2018The Lost City of the Bears\u2019, Anatat Tatanatat was once a powerful civilisation lost in time and the jungles surrounding Fur Fighter Village. Viggo has discovered it, and plans to use the energy contained there to create a portal in the center of the to \u2018The Bad Place\u2019. Before the Fur Fighters can get there, however, they must brave the Jungle of Despair, an area every bit as friendly as it sounds. Once inside \u2018The Bad Place\u2019, the team must find a way to put a stop to it once and for all. VIGGO-A-GOGOFinal Load ScreenThe final port of call is Viggo-A-GoGo. Before they can get to the ultimate confrontation with Viggo himself, the team must fight through through the H.M.S. Viggolina, a huge battleship designed to carry the Attack Planes used against the Fur Fighter Village, the V-100, Viggos submarine, 20,000 leagues under the sea, and, as when fighting any evil villain, the Secret Island base. After, the final boss battle awaits![CR]Versions[CR] An example of the updated graphics of the PS2 versionThough the PS2 version was essentially the same game as the other two versions, it featured updated, Cell-Shaded graphics and added voice acting to every line of dialogue. It also fixed a few glitches from the original, including the notorious save glitch from the Dreamcast version, which corrupted your data if you paused whilst it was saving in some instances. The Dreamcast Version also featured many issues when played on a 50hz TV screen, all fixed on the PS2.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A mage named Garm summoned the demon Skorne long ago using the power of thirteen runestones. Skorne wasn't so into the idea of having a master, so he turned on Garm and banished him to the depths of the Underworld. Following that, he scattered the runestones used to summon him across the four realms of the world in an attempt to prevent anyone from gathering them again. Players are thrust into the role of recovering four keys and the thirteen runestones from the different worlds in order to defeat Skorne. The four original characters from the original Gauntlet--Warrior, Valkyrie, Archer, and Wizard--return in Legends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The combat of Legends revolves around the use of basic melee attacks, basic ranged attacks, magic, and potent power attacks. Each character has their own cosmetic variance of attacks but combat is basically mechanically similar. Melee and ranged attacks are used at their respective distances. Magic can be used in one of three ways: an explosion of magic going outward from the character, a damaging shield that surrounds the character, or a thrown potion that explodes when it hits the ground. Power attacks can come in three different varieties. The kind of power attack is determined by a meter above the character's section at the bottom of the screen. The meter slowly fills up as the player causes more damage. The first (or green) level attack produces a more powerful version of the character's normal melee attack. The second (or yellow) level attack produces a 360-degree attack. The third and final (or red) level attack produces an indestructible projectile attack that annihilates any enemies in its path.ItemsBesides the power attacks, the other main variation of the gameplay in Legends in through the use of items. Usually, items are found within treasure chests and barrels scattered throughout the different levels, with the occasional item being found out in the open. On top of that, many of the items are available from the store in the hub between levels. Most of the items in the game fall into general categories with a some outliers being one of a kind.Amulets - Amulets add extra power to the character's standard attack, both melee and ranged. There are four different kinds of amulets (light, fire, electric, and acid) but the difference in merely cosmetic. No one type of amulet is more effective than the other. Only one kind of amulet can be equipped at a time, as well. Amulets last a maximum of 90 seconds.Breaths - Breaths attack enemies in cone in front of the player, with enough strength to take out weaker enemies in one hit. Similar to amulets, breaths come in variations of fire, electric, and acid (no light). Breaths can be stocked up to a maximum of 15 charges.Potions - Potions have multiple uses in Legends. They're most often used to kill Death, who can pop up from random chests or barrels throughout levels to drain health from the player. Potions are the only way to kill Death. They can also be used to attack enemies in a circle near the player, with the radius of that circle increasing as the player's magic skill increases. Potions can be dropped at one's feet, thrown a short distance, or converted into a short-term shield.Shields - Unlike potion shields, item shields are serious business. Coming in either fire or electric, shields from a wall in front (fire) or around (electric) the player that protects from harm and damages any enemies that come into contact with it.Shot Multipliers - 3 or 5 way shot multipliers add additional projectiles to a character's ranged attack, either 3 or 5 shots...obviously.The other significant items that players will come across are keys and gold. Keys unlock things. Gold buys stuff. Fun for all![CR]Characters & Character Progression[CR] The fantasy characters from the original Gauntlet return for Legends each has greater starting ability in a single attribute than the other characters. Warrior - Strength  Wizard - Magic  Archer - Speed  Valkyrie - Armor Characters in Legends can level up from 1 to 99 throughout the game, increasing five different categories: speed, strength, armor, magic, and health. Speed determines both attack speed and movement speed. Strength increases ranged and melee attack power. Armor decreases the amount of damage taken from attacks. Magic increases a character's ability with magic, making all magic attacks more effective. And health increases simply that, health.While each of the attributes naturally increases through leveling up, stat increases can also be bought from the store.[CR]",

It was developed by    Takumi and published by    Capcom. The game is notable for the incredible amount of points that can be obtained (with the world record set at 2,954,296,261,700 on the arcade version, according to the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition). It has been compared to    Treasure's fast paced shooters as well. The game takes place during a war in a futuristic steampunk setting, and the player takes control of one of several different pilots.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Trust me, this is one of the easier momentsGiga Wing is a fast-paced shooter. At points in the game, literally hundreds of bullets and lasers can be onscreen at one time. Because of this, the game utilizes a feature unique to Giga Wing. It is called the Reflect Force; by holding down the A button, the Reflect Force is activated. It makes all of the bullets onscreen go back towards the shooter. The power-up system is also unique. After destroying certain enemies, a P will begin bouncing around the screen. After collecting it, the weapon the player has is upgraded. Up to three can be collected, each making the lasers of the player even more powerful.Bombs can also be collected an then shot (by using the B button). When unleashed, the bomb explodes over a radius of the entire screen, flashing lightning and fire while causing incredible damage to every enemy craft in sight. Each one of the ships starts out with two bombs, and up to seven can be collected at one time.Expansive and difficult bossesThere are four different crafts to choose from, each having a unique shooting pattern. As power-ups are collected, the lasers upgrade in different ways. Each pilot reacts similarly to the scenarios presented in the game, however there are slight differences.The score multiplier is very unique. When an enemy is destroyed, it drops medals of varying size and shape (Strider 2, also by Capcom, also utilizes this medal system). Each medal is worth a certain amount of points, and the points add up as a score multiplier. For example, if the player collects five medals that are worth five points each, then the score multiplier will be at twenty-six. Each medal collected after that will add to that value. The medals come in varying amounts of one, five, ten, twenty, or one-hundred.[CR]",

Grand Theft Auto 2 would have a similar top down style to the original game, but with enhanced game mechanics and graphics. This was the last of the Grand Theft Auto games to use a strict top down camera. The game was first released on the original Playstation in October 22, 1999 and then two days later for PC. Grand Theft Auto 2 was also ported to both Game Boy Color and Dreamcast. There has been some criticisms of all versions that the storyline was lackluster and that the rewards for completing missions was disproportionate to the cost of items in-game.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The PC version of GTA2 included IP to IP multiplayer. This means that there were no server browsers and that most games were privately hosted in an era when broadband connections still had relatively low market penetration. The multiplayer had severe lag due to this networking model and was called \"unusable\" by most users. It should be noted that once someone is in Multiplayer, the map is drastically reduced, and most AI features are turned off.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Head RadioApostles of Funk - Yellow ButterPussywillows - Real LoveDavidson - All I Wanna DoThe One - SouthparkBula Matari - Taxi DriversFlytronix - PendulumAnna - Do It On Your OwnTesting - My Tiny WorldStikki Fingerz - Holdin' It Out For YouConor & Jay - Vegas RoadTrack 7 - I Wanna PhunkKREZNegro Vs.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Grandia II was developed by Game Arts with additional services provided by many companies in specific parts of the game, aka CG production. Additional help was provided by employees of IKUSABUNE, Shirogumi, Xeonix and Studio Deen, for CG animation.Grandia II was released for the Sega Dreamcast on August 3rd, 2000 in Japan. Later releasing on December 6th in the US. It was a traditional Japanese Anime-style RPG. As well as being noted for its then state-of-the-art 3D graphics, Grandia II is perhaps better known for its combat system, as some people claim it was the influence behind Final Fantasy X's own battle system.It was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and PC in 2002. Although the Dreamcast version is considered the better of the two due to technical issues present in the PlayStation 2 port. A Steam version of the game will be released, published by GungHo Online Entertainment. This release will feature both mouse and keyboard and gamepad support as well as Steam achievements and Trading Cards.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is unique from a typical turn-based RPG. It combines elements of real-time fighting and turn-based attacks. This allows battles to be faster paced while adding another level of complexity to the fight. Grandia II employs a bar to show how long the character has to wait before making an attack, while allowing the player limited movement during the battle.Since there is real-time and turn-based elements in the fighting it also means that there are more stats to grow for the character. For example there are two forms of speed in the game: how fast the character can attack, and physically moving to the enemy and attacking them. The time in which it takes a character friend or foe to perform their attack is called the \"act\".The ability to cancel an enemy's attack can be used to great advantage, but the key is timing and being able to figure what special attack is about to be done, how long it takes, and if the character can physically make to the enemy and hit them in time.Strategy comes into play as a player has to decide which attack to use to best time his attack hitting the enemy within that short \"act\" period. By doing so the enemy's attack will be canceled or delayed, allowing more characters to attack the enemy and cause greater damage. Later in the game as players level up their skills, the ability to instantly perform attacks adds greater emphasis on delaying attacks, as most Boss battles become more difficult.MagicSome of the best visuals for its timeMagic in the Grandia series is learned by equipping items called mana eggs. In this game different types of eggs existed usually containing 2 to 3 elemental types per egg. These elemental types determine the magic spell the egg could use. Magic can also be leveled up which allows for faster casting and more damage.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersRyudo - Geohound (mercenary)Initially rude, with a very sarcastic attitude, he later comes to terms with the causes of his bitter behaviour through the course of the game. He is usually accompanied by his bird, Skye.Elena - Songstress of GranasMild-mannered, polite, and devoted to her faith, but she can also be quite spirited at times. As a result of this, she often clashes with Ryudo.Roan - Prince of CyrumWhile showing an understanding far beyond his years, he still approaches a lot of common things with childish curiosity and surprisingly good manners.Mareg - Beast WarriorA noble beastman on a quest for revenge after his village was attacked by a merciless superhuman.Tio - AutomataCreated during the war of the Gods some 10,000 years ago she is initially an emotionless being only there to serve. Although through her experiences with Mareg she begins to understand the nature of what makes humans, human.PlotRyudo and his pet bird SkyeThe story starts as Ryudo the Geohound (a kind of mercenary), along with his bird, Skye, accepts a mission to accompany Elena, a songstress of Granas, as she heads to Garmia Tower. As luck would have it the mission turns into much more as an accident occurs at the tower which will require Ryudo and Elena to work together.As they travel around the world they struggle to uncover how Valmar, the Dark God, is once again wrecking havoc on the land. You see the pieces of his body have been sealed away using the power of Granas, the Light God, to prevent Valmar from returning again.

The game also takes material from the film that the game was released with. The Grinch has to collect items and blueprints for inventions in order for his execute his sinister plan. You will travel through multiple sections of the Who world such as Whoville, the Grinch's cave, Wholake, Whoforest and the local dump.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]The Grinch is an action adventure game in which you primarily prank the Who's, collect items and collect blueprints. The gameplay takes place in entirely 3D environments where you will run around with the goal of ruining Christmas for the Who's. You will mainly destroy their gifts or destroy something else Christmas related. You will collect different blue prints in the levels also which help gain the Grinch use of different gadgets. The use of these gadgets is for creating more misery for the different Who's.  Gameboy Color Version   [CR]Other Versions[CR]The premise remains the same in the portable version of the Grinch, but it plays much differently than the console and pc editions. The it plays much more like a hybrid of Pacman and the classic Metal Gear Solid. It takes place in an overhead perspective with gifts along paths on a map. The Pacman element is the way you follow these paths to collect gifts while simultaneously avoiding Who's that will catch the Grinch. The Metal Gear Solid element is you can stealthily avoid the Who's by sneaking around the environment, sometimes crawling under and around furniture. You will also occasionally play as the Grinch's dog Max, but the gameplay remains the same.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Justice is dead. The original rogue gear has been destroyed, but a new one has emerged to strike fear into the heart of a world. Again a contest has begun to see if anyone is worthy to strike down the gear with a diverse cast of fighters appearing to do battle for the tremendous reward. The game plays nearly identically to it's Playstation 1 counterpart, but with massively improved graphics and sound. Two fighters square off in a best out of three match with devastating Destruction moves capable of ending a match at any moment. Most of the characters from the previous game return as well as several newcomers. The game also continues and expands upon the complex story of the first game.[CR]Combat[CR]The game is fundamentally identical to the first Guilty Gear, with one notable exception: the DESTRUCTION moves no longer end the fight absolutely, only the round in which they connect. The game features the same frantic pacing, combos and air-combos as it's predecessor with a new mechanic of a knock-down attack that can be used to interrupt combos as long as the meter is filled as well as the Roman Guard, which prevents damage from special attacks at the cost of draining the tension gauge as long as it's active.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Taking place mere weeks after Sol Badguy defeated Justice, Guilty Gear X finds another Commander-type gear emerging and, fearing yet another large-scale war, a tournament begins to see who can bring the new rogue down. The prize this time will be 500,000 World Dollars, an apparently huge sum. The Commander GEAR is named Dizzy and is wild and uncontrollable.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Sol Badguy: Having killed Justice at last, Sol returns to the tournament to ensure that this new GEAR doesn't represent a threat to humanity. Interstingly, in any of his three endings, Sol decides that she isn't and allows her to live. It is then revealed that Dizzy was Justice's daughter.Ky Kiske: Having heard news of this new GEAR that supposedly doesn't wish to harm humans, Ky is forced to question his own strict moral code and enters the tournament to see if the rumors are true.Robo-Ky: A robotic Ky Kiske that stalks the world, making mayhem and often ruining the good name of the real Ky. Robo-Ky was built to take those of Japanese descent into custody. There are several of them at any given time, roaming the world and sometimes breaking free of their programming.Zato-1: Zato-1 is no more, he is merely a shell of a man completely possessed by the parasitic Eddie. No longer in control of his faculties, Eddie has gone mad with murder and gone out of control, though few know the truth that the parasite is the one in control.Millia Rage: Wracked with guilt at what has become of her former lover, Millia enters the tournament to put his body to rest at long last and free his soul from the monster Eddie. She finds and kills him, but this merely gives Eddie even greater control over the body of Zato-1.Venom: Another orphan raised by the Assassin Guild, Venom rose quickly through the ranks and became Zato-1's right hand man. He grew to idolize the leader of the Guild and couldn't understand it when Millia turned against him. Out of love for his master, Venom enters the tournament to try and save him from the woman as well as curry even more favor in the Guild. Venom wields a pool cue and can conjur billiard balls out of the air, which he can fire in a myriad of directions at his foes. He has declared Millia his enemy because he does not realize that Eddie has taken control of Zato's body.Faust: Dr. Baldhead, visited by the ghost of the girl who died under his care and informed that her death was the result of outside forces rather than his own negligence, has had his sanity restored. However, he cannot rationalize the horror of his deeds during his insanity, and so dons a paper bag to hide his identity. He enters the tournament as a healer, trying to help as many people as he can, though he still fights ferociously. Johnny: The leader of the Jellyfish Pirates and legendary ladies-man (which explains why all the other members of the Jellyfish pirates are women), Johnny enters the tournament strictly for the prize money to finance his pirates. After defeating Dizzy, he realizes she is neither a threat to humanity nor a horrible monster, and spares her life, even offerring her a place on his ship. Johnny uses a Japanese-style wooden sword and strikes quickly with it. He hits on every female opponent he comes across.May: May enters the tournament strictly to impress Johnny and finance the Jellyfish Pirates. Upon encountering Faust, she phobia of bald people (even though Faust wears a bag disguising his identity) manifests and implies even a past interaction between the two. She is more than happy to welcome Dizzy into the Jellyfish Pirates.Jam Kuradoberi: A lighthearted Chinese martial-arts expert, Jam's primary passion is cooking. She enters the second tournament to win the prize money and finance her own restaurant, as well as seeking mysterious ingredients that will allow her food to be completely unique. After a misunderstanding between Testament and Dizzy, she accomplishes both these goals as Sol refused to claim the bounty so it fell to her. Her ability to wield Ki has made her a target of hostile forces, though she herself does not realize that the ability is so unusual. Through the tournament, she develops a crush on Ky Kiske and flirts with him whenever the two meet. She does not wield a weapon, but uses hand-to-hand combat and ki to be the equal of the other members of the cast.Potemkin: The giant has been freed by Gabriel, the leader of a rebellion in the city of Zepp after the events of the first game. Gabriel declared Potemkin the champion of Zepp and appoints him the guardian of the newly formed democracy. To further safeguard the city, he is sent to the tournament as a bounty hunter to try and convince the rogue GEAR to join the newly formed nation. Despite having been freed from his slavery, he still wears the collar of a slave, though it is no longer rigged to explode if he removes it. He finds Dizzy at the end of the game, but Johnny interferes and Dizzy joins the Jellyfish pirates instead.Baiken: This mysterious samurai continues her search for That Man throughout the new tournament, gaining a follower and admirer in Anji Mito. Sadly for Anji, Baiken finds him to be incredibly irritating and an obstacle in her quest.Anji Mito: Anji Mito is a full-blooded Japanese person, which makes him endangered due to the destruction of Japan in the Crusades. He is placed on a government sponsored colony, but detests the lifestyle as being a captive in a zoo. He rebels, stealing the GEAR killing Zessen fans and begins a quest for That Man and more GEARS. He wields the Zessen fans in a very fluid combat-style. He becomes enamoured of the only other Japanese person in the tournament and begins persuing Baiken to learn more about his lost culture.Chipp Zanuff: Having failed to find closure at the conclusion of the first quest, Chipp Zanuff enters the second tournament to meet and protect Dizzy, believing that Justice deserved a second chance, much like he did, and not wanting to see GEARS unfairly persecuted. After Sol spares her life and she joins up with the Jellyfish Pirates, Chipp ventures into the wilderness to train his skills even further.Testament: Having lost Justice, Testament wandered the Earth in despair until he heard news of a new Command GEAR in a secret grove. He sought out this new GEAR in order to protect her, and defends her viciously from any who would seek to harm her. After Sol defeats him, spares Dizzy, and Dizzy joins the Jellyfish Pirates, Testament is satisfied that she's safe and continues his wandering, searching for his purpose in life.Dizzy: A half-human, half GEAR, Dizzy was extremely conflicted but deep down only wanted peace between the two races. She is possessed by two spirits: Angelic Undine and demonic Necro, one used for defensive measures, the other for offensive ones. The two forces clash within her, vying for control of her immense power. These also act as her weapons and she uses them to generate incredible bursts and beams of energy. She grew up in an isolated village, but was exiled when she matured in only three years. She was hidden in a grove after her wings (manifestations of Undine and Necro), and tail grew out by her foster parents, she dwelt there until she was discovered by Testament and the next tournament began.[CR]",

Its target is Jabrow, the Earth Federation Army's stronghold in South America.Due to desperate resistance by the Earth Federation Army, the colony disintegrates in the skies over Saudi Arabia after it enters the Earth's atmosphere. The drop onto Jabrow is prevented but the leading edge of the enormous colony falls on Sidney Australia, transforming the city into an enormous bay.The Zeon Army, which doesn't have the resources to sustain a protracted conflict because it is a space colony state, anticipates a lengthening of the war after the failure of Operation British. They immediately begin a series of Drop Operations to secure resources, and rapidly occupy two thirds of the Earth's surface.the Zeon Army invades Australia, hardest hit by Operation British, in order to secure its abundant subterranean resources. The Federation Army in Australia, having suffered a crushing blow, doesn't appear to stand a chance.11 months after the beginning of the war, the Earth Federation government launches a massive counteroffensive in Europe called Operation Odessa and is victorious.

The GM and GM cannon are mass-production models, but they compare favorably to Zeon mobile suits. Each field member of White Dingo participating in a mission must be assigned a mobile suit. The ideal choice can be determined by both the pilot's style and the mission parameters. Initially these are the only two suits available to the player.Model Name: GM        Model Number: RGM-79        Specs: total height - 18.0 m                      dry weight - 41.2 t        fixed weapons:60mm head-mounted Vulcan x2                                   beam saber        description: A simplified, mass production version of the Gundam developed for hand-to-hand combat. Rolled out immediately before the battle of Jabrow, and large numbers were sent into subsequent battles.

Equipped with a 240mm cannon on its right shoulder, and has reinforced armor. Because its primary duty is mid-range support attacks, it is not suited for hand-to-hand combat.Once a mobile suit is chosen, a pilot must decide what weapons to take for a mission. Each suit can carry one primary weapon, a shield, and a special weapon in addition to any fixed weapons on their chosen suit. These are the basic options available.60mm Vulcan(fixed weapon): Due to low accuracy and scattered fire pattern, most effective at strafing ground targets. Single shots do light damage, but it can be fired continuously. The weapon can become temporarily unusable due to barrel heat, but it has unlimited ammo.100mm Machine Gun(primary weapon): Multi-purpose weapon, easy to use, effective in any mission. One shell doesn't cause much damage, but it can be fired continuously. Ammo is unlimited, but after a set number of shots the magazine must be changed which takes a little time.Rocket Launcher(primary weapon): Detonated by proximity fuse, inflicts damage over a given area. One shot causes a great deal of damage, but it can not be fired continuously. Ammo is unlimited, but after a set number of shots the magazine must be changed which takes a little time. The GM Cannon cannot choose this weapon.Hand Grenade(special weapon): Flight distance can be adjusted as needed, but they are hard to use. One grenade does extensive damage, but they can't be used continuously. Ammunition is limited.240mm Cannon(fixed weapon): Long range and fast firing makes this weapon ideal for sniping. One causes moderate damage and it can be fired relatively quickly. However, ammunition is limited.Beam Saber(fixed weapon): A powerful weapon, especially effective in close quarters combat. This weapon will automatically equip when you approach close enough to an enemy you are locked onto.Large Shield: A typical shield with high coverage and endurance. Designed for the GM Cannon.Small Shield: Has less coverage and endurance than the large shield, but its forked design grants it offensive capabilites when ramming into a foe. Designed for the GM.[CR]",

It features 2 players: Player 1 plays as James Taylor and Player 2 plays as Gary Stewart. The game is an on rails shooter that features 6 chapters each with a unique boss at the end of the stage, all of which are named after tarot cards. Average play time is around 30-45 minutes. There are several costumes and game modes to be unlocked after completion.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Suffer like G did?The House of the Dead 2 follows two AMS agents named James and Gary. These agents have received a call from G and decide to meet him within the city. Upon their arrival, they encounter the Stage 1 boss who taunts them by stating that G was only the beginning. The agents move forward and run into G who has been beaten up badly but is still alive. G hands the agents the notes he took on the weakpoints of the game's bosses. He then tells them to hurry and find Amy and Harry. Amy and Harry are other AMS agents that have come to back them up. Traveling through the city the agents come across many civilians who are in danger. These civilians act as the game's hostage system. The main goal is to find Goldman who has taken Curien's research and used it to further advance the spread of the zombie apocalypse.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]At the time of release in Arcade and on the Dreamcast, The House of the Dead 2 was accepted by most critics.

Lush greenery, native villages, ancient ruins and numerous secrets await you!\"Arctic Circle - \"Gigantic ice formations and a variety of wildlife line this unique track. The race starts near a fishing village high above sea level, continues in a river that winds its way down a glacier, through water-carved ice tunnels until finally dropping you to the ocean for the remainder of the race.\"Medium TracksGreek Isles - \"The Greek Isles water tracks winds through both modern towns and ancient ruins, providing one of the most visually stunning tracks available. This is a bright and challenging track, highlighted by a downhill sliding finish.\"  Greek IslesLake Powell - \"Lake Powell, located in Utah, is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. With its gigantic narrow canyon walls, 1000-year-old Anasazi ruins and smooth water. It is the perfect place for a high-speed super-boat race. Unfortunately, the Utah state police don't agree.\"The Far East -\"The Far East track, located on a river deep in the misty mountains of China, offers a unique blend of challenging river racing and beautiful scenery. The river drops from the mountains into small villages, ancient brick canals and even through palace motes.\"Hard TracksShip Graveyard - \"This deserted atoll was once a productive military shipyard.

Although it is slower than most boats in speed and Mighty Hull activation time, it is the ideal for beginning racer.\"Midway -\"Very stable and not susceptible to being knocked around by other boats, Midway is another good choice for the beginning racer. Midway's weaknesses are its slow booster and Mighty Hull activation times.\"Miss Behave - \"Able to slice the water for better turning. Miss Behave is one of the smallest boats in the H.T.R.A lineup. The boosters are slightly under-powered but Miss Behave's real strength lies in her ability to glide while in the air. With parts salvaged from a World War II aircraft, Miss Behave is the \"flyer\" of the beginning boats.\"Medium Boats Banshee - \"Once a standard hydroplane, Banshee was altered for H.T.R.A racing. Banshee is lightweight and easily knocked around by other boats, but once you've mastered unique handling of the boat you may never choose another boat again!\"Tidal Blade - \"Tidal Blade's sleek, dragster like hull design allows it to slice through any water condition. When you have activated your Mighty Hull feature, use Tidal Blade's long bow to knock the competition out of the water. At times, if Tidal Blade gets bumped it can be hard to control and keep stable.\"Thresher - \"Known as the \"  caddy\" of the H.T.R.A lineup, Thresher is the easiest boat to control. Big and heavy, the boat is well balanced and is easy to steer. Although it has a fairly slow Mighty Hull activation time, Thresher secret weapon is its ability to knock opponents around by using its heavy frame.\"Advanced BoatsCutthroat - \"Lightweight and as close to a military jet fighter as you can get, Cutthroat is one of the best boats in the H.T.R.A lineup. Heavily altered and using \"borrowed\" military hardware, Cutthroat can soar off of H.T.R.A ramps or other objects for great distances. Use this to your advantage. Even though it has an extremely fast Mighty Hull activation time, it is very light and easily tossed around by other boats.\" CutthroatRad Hazard - \"Created with scrap parts found outside U.S Government Area 51 property, Rad Hazard is recommended for the most experienced racers. Use the boosters to help you take corners better. The fast Mighty Hull activation time helps to keep the competition away. Fast and powerful, Rad Hazard is a boat to reckoned with.\"Razorback - \"The most difficult boat to control in the H.T.R.A lineup! Once thought of as a total design failure, Razorback was forgotten until an H.T.R.A member learned the secret to mastering this fast and furious boat! With speed and Mighty Hull activation time like no other, Razorback is recommended for only the most experienced racers!\"Bonus BoatsThe bonus boat are unlocked once the player beats the first nine levels of the game.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up from Treasure in which the player must evade a bullet hell storm of fire by switching their polarity from black to white to black again. Bullets of the same polarity will be harmless to the player. The story involves the player taking on an Empire of \"Divine Ones\", who became all-powerful after discovering a divine weapon. The player character is shot down near a village of exiles from the Empire, is restored to health and is given a special fighter plane that is able to switch polarities which is named for the place of its construction: Ikaruga.Ikaruga was developed for the Arcade by Treasure in 2001. It was later ported to the Sega Dreamcast the subsequent year, following its spiritual predecessor Radiant Silvergun to a Sega console. When it was released on the GameCube the year after that in 2003 it also saw localized versions in the US and Europe for the first time. The game would see another global release for the Xbox 360 Games Store in 2008 courtesy of Microsoft Game Studios.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Large enemies will force you to dodge or absorb their bullets.The gameplay in Ikaruga revolves around black and white energy. The player ship can change between the two colors, and fires shots that match its current polarity. All of the enemies are either black or white, and hitting enemies with their opposite color does additional damage. The player ship can absorb same-colored enemy fire, and absorbing shots charges a secondary attack. There are three difficulty levels.On \"Normal\", enemies that match the player's ship's color release a burst of same-colored shots when destroyed. On \"Hard\" all destroyed enemies release a burst of shots in their color, and on \"Easy\" none of the enemies release any shots when destroyed. Despite their names, \"Easy\" and \"Normal\" modes can actually make the game more difficult in certain situations, because they reduce the number of dots that a player can absorb to charge their screen-clearing special attack.Like many bullet-hell shooters, the hitbox for the player's ship in Ikaruga does not encompass the player's entire ship and only exists at the ship's exact center. If an enemy projectile or ship makes contact with the center of player's ship, they lose a life. On each playthrough a player has three lives. Once these lives are depleted they must use a Continue if they wish to keep playing.ChainsAn extra part of the game which gives it more depth is the chain combo system. A chain combo occurs when a player destroys three ships of a certain color in a row. For example, if players defeat three black ships, then another three black ships, and then three white ones, that is three chains. Each level has a perfect playthrough pattern by which the player can clear the level with an unending chain combo. The chain system provides additional depth to those who have cleared all the levels, and encourages repeat playthroughs and memorization of the enemies' patterns.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The plot of Ikaruga revolves around a group called \"The Divine Ones\" lead by Tenro Horai. Horai discovered an item called the power of the Gods, and with it he led his island nation on a path of conquest, taking over several nations, but a group of freedom fighters called the Tenkaku arose to oppose them. They fought back against the Horai but were defeated, except for one man called Shinra, who landed near the town of Ikaruga. There he recovered and was nursed back to health, vowing to defeat the Horai. The villagers trusted him enough to give him a unique fighter plane developed by their village, the Ikaruga, it is capable of using both types of energies and switching between them, that is when Shinra begins to fight back. When the game is played co-operatively, the second player assumes the role of Kagari, one of Horai's mercenaries who was defeated by Shinra. Due to Shinra sparing her life, she decided to join the resistance, and the villagers equipped her ship, the Ginkei, with the same polarity swapping powers of the Ikaruga.[CR]Development[CR]Ikaruga was developed for Sega's NAOMI arcade hardware by a core group of three people within Treasure Co. Ltd. Hiroshi Iuchi, famed for his work on the shooter classic Radiant Silvergun acted as the game's lead designer, and also worked on the game's backgrounds and music.While not officially a sequel, Ikaruga contains similar gameplay to Radiant Silvergun and a distillation of that game's combo-based scoring system . The game received a disk release on the Dreamcast and GameCube, and is available for Xbox Live Marketplace.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Although it did not sell many units in its initial Japanese release (around 18,500 units in its first week on Dreamcast and around 6,000 units in its first week on GameCube), it is highly regarded by shoot 'em up fans, as can be seen on this active unofficial leaderboard. Its d\u00e9but on Xbox Live Arcade also boosted its sales significantly and added official leaderboards and replay options that allow players to compete for high scores and compare techniques.After the game's initial release, Treasure released a DVD titled Ikaruga Appreciate which featured playthroughs of the game by some of the world's best players. The DVD includes runs at each difficulty level and acts as a helpful tool for those wishing to understand the game's patterns.In 2011, Ikaruga featured as the final round game in the Omegathon tournament at PAX East.Xbox Live Arcade Release ControversyWhen the game was released the Xbox Live download service, there was some discussion about differences between the downloadable version and the original game. These discrepancies were brought to light by Kingoro58k, an Xbox player and Ikaruga expert. After setting some of the highest scores within the Xbox version of the game, Kingoro58k characterized the port as \"Ikaruga LOL\" and said that it was \"not Ikaruga\". In truth, the differences between the Xbox version and the arcade original amount to a few enemy placement changes and a miniboss in chapter 3 whose patterns are mirrored.[CR]",

Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.[CR]The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio (known outside North America as Jet Set Radio) is an action rollerblading game developed by Smilebit and published by Sega for the Dreamcast on November 1, 2000. As a member of a group of roller-blading delinquents known as the GG's (Graffiti Gang, led by the young Beat), players must try to take over the cel-shaded streets of Tokyo-to by spraying graffiti, evading police, and one-upping each of the rival gangs. A sequel, titled JSRF: Jet Set Radio Future, was later developed and released for the Xbox on February 25, 2002, where the GG's must fight an oppressive mega-corporate enterprise to take back control of the streets.The game was originally released in June 29, 2000 in Japan. The international version (later released in Japan as De La Jet Set Radio) features two new maps (set in a place based on New York City), new songs, new characters, and other new content (including the ability to connect to the Internet to download and upload custom graffiti). A handheld version for the Game Boy Advance was produced by Vicarious Visions and published by THQ (Sega for the European version) on June 26, 2003, featuring isometric graphics and gameplay similar to their handheld Tony Hawk ports.A high-definition port of the original game (as Jet Set Radio) was released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam) on September 19, 2012. It will be released for the PlayStation Vita (also via PlayStation Network) on October 16, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio has the player controlling a roller blading graffiti artist and so there is the expected array of grind rails, half pipes, wall rides and jumps worked into the game world. However the layout is not like games such as the Tony Hawk series. The emphasis in Jet Set Radio is on using the various obstacles and your skating skills to reach taggable objects and then spray paint them in ridiculous, often mid-air style. Points are pushed more into the background with time limits creating the challenge. Tagging buses as you grind past them or bill boards as you back-flip over them is a common event.At first, the player will be dropped into an area of one of the cities of Tokyo-to. The player can skate around, earn some points by grinding on rails. If given enough speed, the player can perform tricks, the player can also wall ride to earn more points as well.But most of the player's time shouldn't be spent on just performing tricks, the player has a time limit to tag certain walls. First the player has to collect spray cans and get to a tagging location, by pressing the left trigger, the player will enter a quick time event. In the quick time event, the game will direct the player to perform certain motions on the analog stick. The player will accumulate more points when the player completes the motions on the analog stick.The more tags the player completes the more aggressive the police will get. This isn't a realistic games by any means and the cops will happily shut down the city in order to to kill vandals. Swat teams, Attack dogs and Tear gas are frequently employed. Players do not have any mechanism to defeat the police instead having to use the rail and the environment to outrun them.The DJ Professor K provides much of the narrative via the pirate radio station Jet Set Radio and gives you heads up on whats going on throughout the game. Additional roller blading degenerates are met throughout the game and recruited to your gang as playable characters.The game has multiple characters that the player can chose. Each character differs in terms of attributes such as, the amount of spray cans each character can hold, the amount of health they have, and the way each character handles.There are three versions of the spray cans that can be found in the stages:Yellow Spray Cans - 1 spray canBlue Spray Can - 5 spray cansRed Spray Can - Will restore health[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio features a total of five levels located in the various districts of Tokyo-to.Shibuya-ChoThe very first level of the game. The rival gang that owns Shibuya-Cho is the jilted Love Shockers.Benten-ChoThis area is owned by a gang known as the Noise Tanks, a group of otakus with a robot-like behavior.Kogane-ChoThis area is owned by the Poison Jam gang. Poison Jam are a group made up of horror movie fanatics.Bantam StreetA level that was added to the U.S release of the game. Bantam Street is loosely based off of an area in New York City.Grind SquareAnother level added to the U.S release of the game. Grind Square is based off of Times Square in New York City.Rokkaku Group BuildingThe game's final level takes place at the top of a large skyscraper in Tokyo-to.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]BeatGumTabMewGaramYo-YoCubeComboPiranhaSlatePotsLove ShockersPoison JamNoise TanksGoji[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio's funky and upbeat soundtrack was a big part in helping form the game's distinctive style. New songs were added in the North American and European releases of the game to cover more musical genres and round the soundtrack out. An American version of the soundtrack CD was released on September 18, 2012 by Sumthing Else Music Works to coincide with the re-release for digital platforms. However, the soundtrack only contains 10 songs from the original game with tracks composed by Hideki Naganuma and one track by Richard Jacques, along with 10 tracks from Jet Set Radio Future, all of which were composed by Hideki Naganuma.Japanese Soundtrack CDHumming the Baseline - Hideki NaganumaLet Mom Sleep - Hideki NaganumaMoody's Shuffle - Hideki NaganumaRock It On - Hideki NaganumaGrace and Glory - Hideki NaganumaSneakman - Hideki NaganumaSweet Soul Brother - Hideki NaganumaThat's Enough - Hideki NaganumaSuper Brothers - Guitar VaderMagical Girl - Guitar VaderMiller Ball Breakers - Deavid SoulOn the Bowl (A Fargus Remix) - Deavid SoulUp-Set Attack - Deavid SoulYappie Feet - Deavid SoulFunky Radio - B.B.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio (known outside North America as Jet Set Radio) is an action rollerblading game developed by Smilebit and published by Sega for the Dreamcast on November 1, 2000. As a member of a group of roller-blading delinquents known as the GG's (Graffiti Gang, led by the young Beat), players must try to take over the cel-shaded streets of Tokyo-to by spraying graffiti, evading police, and one-upping each of the rival gangs. A sequel, titled JSRF: Jet Set Radio Future, was later developed and released for the Xbox on February 25, 2002, where the GG's must fight an oppressive mega-corporate enterprise to take back control of the streets.The game was originally released in June 29, 2000 in Japan. The international version (later released in Japan as De La Jet Set Radio) features two new maps (set in a place based on New York City), new songs, new characters, and other new content (including the ability to connect to the Internet to download and upload custom graffiti). A handheld version for the Game Boy Advance was produced by Vicarious Visions and published by THQ (Sega for the European version) on June 26, 2003, featuring isometric graphics and gameplay similar to their handheld Tony Hawk ports.A high-definition port of the original game (as Jet Set Radio) was released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam) on September 19, 2012. It will be released for the PlayStation Vita (also via PlayStation Network) on October 16, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio has the player controlling a roller blading graffiti artist and so there is the expected array of grind rails, half pipes, wall rides and jumps worked into the game world. However the layout is not like games such as the Tony Hawk series. The emphasis in Jet Set Radio is on using the various obstacles and your skating skills to reach taggable objects and then spray paint them in ridiculous, often mid-air style. Points are pushed more into the background with time limits creating the challenge. Tagging buses as you grind past them or bill boards as you back-flip over them is a common event.At first, the player will be dropped into an area of one of the cities of Tokyo-to. The player can skate around, earn some points by grinding on rails. If given enough speed, the player can perform tricks, the player can also wall ride to earn more points as well.But most of the player's time shouldn't be spent on just performing tricks, the player has a time limit to tag certain walls. First the player has to collect spray cans and get to a tagging location, by pressing the left trigger, the player will enter a quick time event. In the quick time event, the game will direct the player to perform certain motions on the analog stick. The player will accumulate more points when the player completes the motions on the analog stick.The more tags the player completes the more aggressive the police will get. This isn't a realistic games by any means and the cops will happily shut down the city in order to to kill vandals. Swat teams, Attack dogs and Tear gas are frequently employed. Players do not have any mechanism to defeat the police instead having to use the rail and the environment to outrun them.The DJ Professor K provides much of the narrative via the pirate radio station Jet Set Radio and gives you heads up on whats going on throughout the game. Additional roller blading degenerates are met throughout the game and recruited to your gang as playable characters.The game has multiple characters that the player can chose. Each character differs in terms of attributes such as, the amount of spray cans each character can hold, the amount of health they have, and the way each character handles.There are three versions of the spray cans that can be found in the stages:Yellow Spray Cans - 1 spray canBlue Spray Can - 5 spray cansRed Spray Can - Will restore health[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio features a total of five levels located in the various districts of Tokyo-to.Shibuya-ChoThe very first level of the game. The rival gang that owns Shibuya-Cho is the jilted Love Shockers.Benten-ChoThis area is owned by a gang known as the Noise Tanks, a group of otakus with a robot-like behavior.Kogane-ChoThis area is owned by the Poison Jam gang. Poison Jam are a group made up of horror movie fanatics.Bantam StreetA level that was added to the U.S release of the game. Bantam Street is loosely based off of an area in New York City.Grind SquareAnother level added to the U.S release of the game. Grind Square is based off of Times Square in New York City.Rokkaku Group BuildingThe game's final level takes place at the top of a large skyscraper in Tokyo-to.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]BeatGumTabMewGaramYo-YoCubeComboPiranhaSlatePotsLove ShockersPoison JamNoise TanksGoji[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Jet Grind Radio's funky and upbeat soundtrack was a big part in helping form the game's distinctive style. New songs were added in the North American and European releases of the game to cover more musical genres and round the soundtrack out. An American version of the soundtrack CD was released on September 18, 2012 by Sumthing Else Music Works to coincide with the re-release for digital platforms. However, the soundtrack only contains 10 songs from the original game with tracks composed by Hideki Naganuma and one track by Richard Jacques, along with 10 tracks from Jet Set Radio Future, all of which were composed by Hideki Naganuma.Japanese Soundtrack CDHumming the Baseline - Hideki NaganumaLet Mom Sleep - Hideki NaganumaMoody's Shuffle - Hideki NaganumaRock It On - Hideki NaganumaGrace and Glory - Hideki NaganumaSneakman - Hideki NaganumaSweet Soul Brother - Hideki NaganumaThat's Enough - Hideki NaganumaSuper Brothers - Guitar VaderMagical Girl - Guitar VaderMiller Ball Breakers - Deavid SoulOn the Bowl (A Fargus Remix) - Deavid SoulUp-Set Attack - Deavid SoulYappie Feet - Deavid SoulFunky Radio - B.B.

The game is endorsed by legendary British snooker player James Warren \"Jimmy\" White MBE, commonly known as \"The Whirlwind\".Cueball lets players explore three rooms of Jimmy White's own house, consisting of a hallway area, an American 50's style pool room, and a British 19th century snooker room. Each room includes a bumblebee-guided virtual tour, a feature referred to as the Jimmy White BeeCam.In addition to the basic games, the pool and snooker rooms offer a variety of interactive elements. The decor and activities are themed appropriately to each room's time period \u2014 for example, the 50's style pool room contains a jukebox while the 19th century snooker room contains an antique radio.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]SnookerAs the manual says, \"if you understand the rules of snooker then you'll find this version strangely familiar\".PoolThe pool mode includes options for UK- and US-style pool, offering both US 8-ball and US 9-ball play as well.According to the manual, \"assuming you've already had a play in the snooker room you should be immediately at home in the pool room\". This would seem to suggest that players should begin their journey in the snooker room.DartsThe darts minigame is available in the snooker room and includes 301, 501, and Around the Clock play modes. Players can choose to face off against either a CPU opponent or a human opponent in the same room via pass-and-play.CheckersCheckers (also known as \"draughts\" in the UK) is available in the snooker room. It plays like a standard game of checkers, but with animated 3D pieces. Like darts, checkers can be played either against the CPU or against a human opponent in the same room.DropzoneDropzone, available in the pool room, is an arcade game about rescuing stranded men from a hostile alien planet and returning them to their moon base. The player uses a jetpack to fly to each man, pick them up, and return them to the base. Fortunately, the player is also armed with a laser weapon and smart bomb to fend off attacking aliens, along with a cloaking device to hide from them.But this game holds darker secrets as well. According to the manual, \"Lose all of your men, and you have to survive in a volcanic alternative dimension. Oh yes.\"Scoring works as follows:Men100 - 500 for rescuing during wave100-500 for each man surviving the wave0 if destroyedAndroid50 if shot while descending with Planter50 if shot while chasing a man500 if shot while falling from a destroyed PlanterEnemies150 for Planters250 for Nemesites150 for Anti-matter250 for Blunder Storm750 for Spores250 for Trailers100 for NmeyesAdditionally, Dropzone awards the player 10 posthumous points after they lose a life, \"just in case you were at 9,990 points with no lives left\".One Armed BanditThe One Armed Bandit is a slot machine available in the pool room. Each pull of the One Armed Bandit's handle costs 25 cents, but offers the opportunity for rich rewards. On some spins, if the player wasn't able to complete a matching set, they are offered the ability to hold or nudge one or more of the reels to affect their chances.[CR]Pool and Snooker Gameplay[CR]Both pool and snooker can be played either against another player in the same room or against a CPU opponent. Players can aim their shots, put \"english\" (spin) on the cueball, and even see a dotted-line trail of where their shot is going to bounce.Players can choose to view the tables from either a 2D fixed-perspective angle above the table or from a more interactive 3D view behind the cueball. The players' cues are visible and fully animated, along with a ghostly set of hands that float in mid-air and direct the cue.[CR]",

Based on the manga of the same name (more specifically the Stardust Crusaders arc), JoJo's Bizarre Adventure stars Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese teenager who must use his bizarre supernatural powers (known as the \"Stand\") to travel from Asia to Egypt and defeat an ancestral enemy to his family, the vampire Dio Brando. The game is an updated version of JoJo's Venture (released a year prior), adding eight new playable characters.The game was later released on the Dreamcast (including the original JoJo's Venture as a bonus) on October 31, 1999 and the PlayStation (featuring an exclusive \"Super Story Mode\") on March 31, 2000. A high-definition port of the game (by CyberConnect2) was later released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) and PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on August 21, 2012.JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the last of the six games released for the short-lived CPS-3 hardware (which include JoJo's Venture, Red Earth, and the Street Fighter III trilogy).[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The story follows the adventures of a Japanese teenager Jotaro Kujo, who, after developing the bizarre supernatural abilities known as the \"Stand\" and learning from his grandfather Joseph Joestar of its relation with their bloodline and with the ancestral enemy of his family, the vampire Dio Brando, embarks on a quest to defeat Dio and save his mother, whose life is threatened as she's been unable to control the power of her own newly-manifested stand.In the process, Jotaro is joined by allies such as Noriaki Kakyoin, Mohammad Avdol, Jean Pierre Polnareff, and the stand using dog, Iggy. Jotaro and friends all decide to travel to Egypt to confront Dio in one final battle. However, they get delayed constantly by Dio's assassin's, as his ties to the Joestar bloodline enable him to sense them coming. When they eventually make it to Egypt, they face many problems, including Kakyoin's injury. When the group confronts Dio's, they are shocked by his unique, and immense powers. Dio assaults Avdol along with his 2nd in command, Vanilla Ice, who murders him using his stand. Finally, Dio faces Jotaro in a final battle, but not before killing Kakyoin, who returned to help them defeat Dio. Dio also sucked the blood out of Joseph, becoming incredibly strong in the process. Once Jotaro finally defeats him, he, his grandfather, and the other survivors of the group return to find that Jotaro's mother is recovering.[CR]Stand System[CR]Stands serve as an alternate attack mode or attacks alongside the character. Most characters can switch between Normal and Stand modes. Characters who has Stand mode will have a small blue gauge that represents the Stand's durability. It will regenerate during Normal mode. Certain specials and supers can only be executed in either mode.In Normal mode, the character's normal attacks are not combo-able. Characters are allowed to use dodge roll. Using a special or super attack will summon the Stand that will act independent of the character's movement and briefly execute a lesser version of the attack. Also, the character will receive chip damage while blocking.In Stand mode, the character's normal attacks are combo-able. Characters are not allowed to use dodge roll. Special attacks are enhanced but the Stand cannot act independent of the character. The character will not receive chip damage from blocking and it will instead be transferred to the Stand's durability. Most characters are allowed to double-jump during Stand mode. The character will have a larger hit box during Stand mode and can be hit by high attacks even while crouching.The Stand will receive durability damage if directly attacked or when absorbing chip damage. When the Stand is attacked directly, the character will also suffer that amount in damage. Once durability is depleted, the Stand will disappear and the character will suffer Guard Break and an extended hitstun. Certain attacks can also deplete the entire durability gauge in one hit.There is also an ability dubbed \"Tandem\" attack. Using 1 power bar, the Stand can be commanded to execute a series of attacks while the player is free to act. Also, certain characters allow the player to take direct control of the Stand and it can move way from the character. On the downside, the character will be left completely vulnerable to attacks.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Jotaro KujoDio BrandoShadow DioJoseph JoestarIggyAlessyMidlerChacaD'BoJean Pierre PolnareffNoriaki KakyoinNew Kakyoin , a variant of KakyoinIcedMuhammed AvdolYoung Joseph/JoJoHol HorseHol Horse w/ Voing (another variant character with alternate supers)Pet ShopMahrahiaBlack PolnareffKhanRubber Soul[CR]",

It is the seventh installment of the                   King of Fighters series and is the final King of Fighters game by the original SNK before the company became financially bankrupt. The story continues from                  The King of Fighters '99, as commander                 Heidern uses the King of Fighters tournament (with the aid of his friend, Ling, who has his own secret agenda) to lure protagonists                K' and               Maxima out so they could be interrogated into telling the whereabouts of the evil NESTS syndicate.  The Hero team from the previous installment was split into two teams: the Hero team and the Benimaru team, each including new characters, such as the mercenary              Vanessa, the Mexican wrestler             Ramon, the agent            Seth, and the assassin           Lin.          Blue Mary and         King from the Women Fighters team are swapped with        Mai Shiranui and       Yuri Sakazaki of the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting team.      Li Xiangfei from the Women Fighters team was replaced by the new     Hinako Shijo.    Kyo Kusanagi and   Iori Yagami are playable with no team association, with Kyo's clones absent. A new character and sub-boss,  Kula Diamond (the \"Anti-K'\"), debuts in this installment.  The game also features unique alternate Strikers based on characters from either earlier installments of the King of Fighters series, from other SNK franchises, or completely new conceptual versions of characters.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1999, Soul Reaver was released as a sequel to 1996's Blood Omen. The game was developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Eidos Interactive. Soul Reaver tells the tale of Kain's first lieutenant, Raziel, as he seeks revenge on his master. The game drops the static top-down camera from the first game for a third person view. The gameplay focuses mainly on puzzles and action adventure. In a twist from the last game, Kain is now the antagonist.On December 6th, 2012 Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was released as a digital download on the Steam store for PC.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]RazielMany centuries have passed since Kain had to make the fateful decision at the end of Blood Omen. The game starts on the premise that Kain refused to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth, heal the land, and ensure the extinction of vampires, but instead chose to rule a decaying world. He has raised six vampire lieutenants and they have created multiple clans and established an empire over Nosgoth. Over the course of time Kain and his lieutenants have evolved and have become less human and more divine in nature. Kain was always the first one to evolve and his lieutenants would soon follow. Until Raziel, his first lieutenant, developed a pair of wings before him. In a fit of jealous rage Kain viciously tears off Raziel's wings and condemns him to an eternity of pain and suffering by casting him into the waters of the Lake of the Dead.But all was not lost for Raziel survived thanks to an ancient deity called The Elder God. The Elder God confided to Raziel many truths and revelations of creation, death, souls and hunger. It seems Kain's impudent vampire dynasty was depriving The Elder from Nosgoth souls, which it had been devouring for eons. The Elder offered Raziel a chance of revenge against Kain and his traitorous followers: Agree to walk the material plane and dispatch his former brethren. Upon agreement to this Raziel is transformed into a wraith who now hungers for souls, not blood. We follow his tale as he seeks vengeance on his brethren and Kain.Raziel later discovers that he was actually an inquisitor of vampires in his human life before he died and was resurrected by Kain as his first lieutenant.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Soul Reaver's gameplay was drastically different from Blood Omen. While the game still has the same morbid atmosphere, the camera has been changed to a dynamic third person view. Players can now stop and look around at their surroundings. The game features an abundance of puzzles, though most of them are simplistic and require little effort to complete. The game actually got some criticism for its numerous block puzzles, which started to feel repetitive towards the end of the game.The action and combat in the game followed the traditional hack and slash method, where players can use a standard primary and secondary attack to beat down their opponents. Raziel can pick up any weapon from his surrounding to dispose his enemies. He can kill his vampire foes by impaling them, drowning them in water, exposing them to sunlight or setting them on fire. Some of the boss fights require a bit of puzzle solving as Raziel has to use the environment to deal with them. Combat changes quite a bit once Raziel gets a hold of his wraith blade - the Soul Reaver. The blade sustains him in the material realm and you don't need to go looking for vampires to satisfy your hunger. His wraith blade also gains additional powers throughout the course of the game, such as the ability to fire bolts of energy that knock enemies back, the ability to take on the essence of fire to dispatch foes quickly, and the combination of the two which allows for the immolation of enemies from a distance.A major aspect of the game revolved around Raziel shifting in and out of the spirit realm. Since he can't die, Raziel just goes back into the Spirit Realm when weakened. He can also willingly shift in and out using planar portals spread throughout Nosgoth. These play an important part in all the puzzles as Raziel can pass through certain obstacles in the spectral realm but he can only open doors in the material realm. Players have to think their way through some puzzles to avoid excessive backtracking.[CR]Environment[CR]The games environment has a steampunk feel to it as the vampires have created huge factories to black out the skies. Nosgoth is a state of decay as Kain's empire has corrupted the world to its core. The age of the vampires seem to be on the decline as most of their monuments are falling apart. The overall atmosphere of the game is very dark and morbid.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]Minimum:OS:Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7Processor:1.8 GHz ProcessorMemory:512 MB RAMGraphics:3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7DirectX\u00ae:7.0Hard Drive:2 GB HD space[CR]",

Max' is the action type, with an unique four-arm setup that allows you to quad-wield any weapons he pick up, and can be equipped however you want: Four uzis, or one pistol, one shotgun and two uzis, and etc.Dr. Fluke Hawkins focuses on puzzle-solving, although there is a lot of combat involved. You have two hands and two inventory spaces, which allows you to merge items, creating solutions to puzzles or inventing new weaponry. The first two basic things you need to combine are toast and a toaster, which you will be able to mix into a weapon later. The game starts off with a level with Kurt, then changes to Max, then to Fluke, and rotates in that order.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game starts directly after MDK ends, with Kurt and the others celebrating for saving the world, when they detect alien movement on the earth's surface, namely Edmonton, Canada.

It was the first game to introduce the \"  Kudos\" system that rewarded drivers for style as well as speed. This gave the game a arcade tilt to the gameplay, and allowed players a new focus during races, instead of soley fighting for points or positions players also competed to complete races with the most \"  Kudos\" in order to unlock the later races.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Metropolis Street Racer features several standard racing game modes, including a lengthy and unique single player campaign, time trials, and both online and offline multiplayer. The core of the game focuses on the single player campaign, wherein you unlock the cars and tracks for play in the other modes by progressing through a series of 25 sets of challenges. Each set of challenges is called a chapter, and there are several types of challenges, keeping the game feeling fresh. Races take place in different locations around the world, the time of day that the race takes place is calculated using the time set on the internal Dreamcast clock and the location of the player within the world. The types of challenges presented are:One-on-One: A standard single race against a single opponent.Street Race: A standard single race against several opponents.Championship: A series of races against multiple opponents, where score is tallied after each race based on finishing position.Hotlap: A standard single race where you race solo attempting to beat a specified time.Challenge: A challenge with custom rules for completion, such as passing a specified number of cars within the race.[CR]Car List[CR]Alfa Romeo156GtvSpiderAudiS3TT CoupeTT RoadsterFiatBarchettaCoupe 20v TurboFordMustang JensenS-V8 MazdaMiataMX-5RoadsterRX7MercedesBenz SL320Benz SLK MGMGFRV8 Mitsubishi3000GTGTOEclipseEclipse 99Eclipse SpiderFTOLancer EVO VINissan300ZXFairlady ZFairlady Z SpiderSilviaSkyline GTRVarieta OPEL / VauxhallASTRA CoupeOPCSpeedsterVX220Peugeot206206 Cabriolet306406 CoupeRenaultClio V6MeganeSpider ToyotaCelicaCelica 99Celica GT-FourMR-3MR2SupraTVRChimaera[CR]Unlockable Cars[CR] Unlockable cars are non-traditional \"cars\" won from Special Events in the single player campaign.

Specifically, the game was developed by many members of Atlus who have been responsible for the modern titles in the Megami Tensei franchise, notably series director Katsura Hashino, art director Kazuma Kaneko, and composer Shoji Meguro. It is considered a part of the Megami Tensei universe, despite not bearing the moniker. Typical sword-play  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Maken X was unique in that it was one of the first instances of a first-person game having a focus on close-quarters, melee-based combat. The game revolves around the titular Maken X sword, which is actually the lead \"character\" of the game. The word \"Maken\" directly translates from Japanese as \"Demon Blade\" and the \"X\" is derived from the latin deus ex machina (\"God from the machine\").  Gameplay revolves around Maken X's unique ability; the \"brainjack.\" As you progress through the game, you will \"brainjack\" several different characters, and doing so provides you with altered combat abilities and charactaristics. During gameplay, you will also come across \"ampules\" dropped by fallen enemies, which can be used to improve your stats in an RPG-like fashion. [CR]Censorship[CR] Maken-X was heavily censored in the localization for Western audiences, as the Japanese version featured a controversial boss battle against the Pope, set in the Vatican, and some enemies adorned Nazi symbolism (specifically, some enemies had swastikas for faces). This is not actually the first time a game in the Megami Tensei series has featured controversial real-world characters or symbolism; Persona 2: Innocent Sin, for example, featured Hitler as a major antagonist.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR] Maken-X receieved a generally favorable critical reception in the US, with a GameRankings aggregate score of about 71%. Most criticism revolved around the game's localization, with many feeling both the translation and the English voice acting were poor. IGN.com notably gave the import version of the game a 9.0/10, whereas the domestic version got a 7.9, to which they cited the localization as a large factor.    [CR]",

The third installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom crossover series (and sequel to Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter), the game adds fighters from various Capcom games (unlike the previous games, which were strictly from Street Fighter Alpha 2) to fight alongside Marvel's superheroes. The installment also adds the concept of \"partners\" (special assist characters taking the place of the backup character in \"assist attacks\") and \"Duo Team Attack\" (a timed event in which the backup character jumps in and both characters are controlled simultaneously, having unlimited use of Super Moves).The game was ported to the Dreamcast on September 30, 1999, adding a new game mode (called Cross Fever), which allows four-player simultaneous gameplay. It was later ported to the PlayStation on January 31, 2000, removing the tag-team mechanics for normal gameplay (restricting it to traditional 1v1 round-based fights, in which \"assist attacks\" can be performed by either partner characters or secondary characters), while re-adding the Crossover mode from previous ports (in which the tag-team mechanic is brought back, but each player's secondary character is the opposing player's primary character).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ryu unleashing his superMarvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes was distinguishable from the rest in the series due to the ability to call upon the help from \"assist\" characters, as well as the ability to perform a special attack where both of the characters would be in the field at the same time. The game plays quicker than other 2D fighting games at the time. Play focuses heavily on quick reactions, smart team management, and both solo and team super moves.In addition, this game introduced the Duo Team Attack. In the Duo Team Attack, both characters on the team could be controlled simultaneously and had an unlimited use of super moves during the time. In the PlayStation version, the Duo Team Attack worked where the assist character could be summoned repeatedly during this time. The game starts off and the player gets to choose two characters. Then, the fighting starts, with randomly selected pairs of other characters gradually increasing in difficulty until the final boss, Onslaught.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]MarvelFightersSpider-Man, one of the key characters in Marvel's assortment of fightersCaptain AmericaGambitHulk (has a secret orange variation)Onslaught (unplayable final boss with two forms)Spider-ManVenom (has a secret variation resembling Carnage)War Machine (has a secret golden variation)WolverineSpecial PartnersColossusCyclopsIcemanJubileeJuggernautMagnetoPsylockeRogueSentinel (hidden, must be inputted via a special codeStormThorU.S. AgentCapcomFightersRyu, one of the key characters in Capcom's assortment of fightersCaptain Commando (from Captain Commando)Chun-Li (from Street Fighter II, has a secret \"cyborg\" variation, named Shadow Lady)Jin (from Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness)Mega Man (from the classic Mega Man series)Morrigan (from the Darkstalkers series, has a secret variation resembling Lilith)Roll (from the classic Mega Man series, secret character)Ryu (from Street Fighter II, has the ability to switch, in mid-game, between his, Ken's, and Akuma's move sets)Strider Hiryu (from the Strider series)Zangief (from Street Fighter II, has the ability to, in mid-game, transform his body to iron)Special PartnersAnita (from the Darkstalkers series)Arthur (from the Ghosts 'n Goblins series)Devilot (from Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness)Lou & Siva (from Three Wonders, more specifically Midnight Wanderers: Quest for the Chariot)Michelle Heart (from Legendary Wings)Pure & Fur (from Capcom World 2: Adventure Quiz)Saki (from Quiz Nanairo Dreams: Nijiiro-chou no Kiseki)Shadow (hidden \"cyborg\" variation of Charlie from the Street Fighter Alpha series, must be inputted via a special code)Ton Pooh (from the Strider series)Unknown Soldier (from Forgotten Worlds)[CR]",

It contained all the features from the Nintendo 64 version of MK4 as well as the PlayStation version. The Dreamcast version of Mortal Kombat 4 followed the same storyline as Mortal Kombat 4, and the only differences were the addition of new characters and endings. The visuals were also in higher resolution than the arcade version. Some of the recurring characters (Kitana, Sektor, Baraka) have exatly the same fatalities as the players seen in Mortal Kombat 2,3 and UMK, while others have them altered. Cyrax has his MK3 self destruct fatality but the helicopter is replaced by Smoke's armageddon (where he Earth explodes). Mileena - while left with nail spit - is given a sai throw, which has exactly the same effect on the opponent. Finally, Kung Lao is left with his hat decapitation (although its not necessary to control the hat anymore) but the excellent MK2 cut-in-half fatality is taken away. Instead he performs a hat throw that removes the opponents head and torso (similar to Jarek's laser beam fatality).[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Despite receiving criticism from many game review sites, including a controversial score of 5.0/10 from Giant Bomb's own Jeff Gerstmann , Mortal Kombat Gold was appreciated by fans of the series and is regarded as the best console version of MK4. However, fans were critical of Cyrax's bomb glitch ( i.e. side stepping only once made them harmless) and also noted that Kung Lao was missing his signature hat throw. There were also complaints that the Dreamcast controller was poorly designed for fighting games in general.[CR]Gold Edition Changes[CR]New CharactersKitanaMileenaCyraxKung LaoBarakaSektorSektor's flamethrower.All these new characters had new corresponding FMV endings to go along with their introduction. The game also features some new stages and a new weapon selection mechanism. The game featured updated graphics that were very similar to the arcade version.There are two versions of the game. The original version had a gold disc decal. The second version had a lot of bug fixes and had a red disc decal.BelokkBelokk was a character that was designed to be an all-new fighter for Mortal Kombat Gold. He was seen in some screenshots in an issue of Game Informer magazine, he presence accidentally leaked by the port's developer Eurocom, although Midway were not yet ready to reveal him. Ultimately, Belokk was never in the finished game, allegedly due to not being able to finish him before the Dreamcast (and by extension, the game)'s release.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR]Development[CR]Mr. Driller originated from an unofficial project at Namco, worked on by a few staff on the side, to develop a new game in the Dig-Dug series. As such the working title of the game was Dig-Dug 3. The main character of the game is Susumu Hori, son of Taizou Hori from Dig-Dug. Later the project was endorsed by Namco and became official, transforming into Mr. Driller en-route.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Mr. Driller is to keep drilling down through a set amount of level (often depending on difficulty) of varying lengths. Upon clearing a level, all blocks above you are destroyed and you are given a boost to your air supply. Your Air supply is your life. You run out, you die. While your air supply constantly dwindles as you are progressing to the next stage, finding air tanks will refill portions of your air. Watch out for rock and boxes marked with an \u201cX\u201d for they take many drills to destroy (slowing you down) and once they are destroyed they take a portion of your air supply.The controls are rather simple: one button is your drill, while the D-pad or analog stick is your movement. You have the ability to use your drill in all four directions and you have the ability to jump up one block to your left or right, granted that there is space for you.As you drill, you will notice that similar colored blocks will link together. These linked blocks are what you should be aiming for because once you tap one part of it with your drill, all the blocks linked in that chain will disappear. Aiming for these while drilling down will clear out a path much faster than just going straight down. Pay attention though, blocks that are not linked and have no support under them will fall down, often on your Mr. Driller. Its not the scariest thing in the world, for blocks will link even if they are falling, providing some intense moments where you think your end has come only for the block to link at the last moment.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Don't forget to move left and right! Having the ability to move left and right will save you from falling objects while also giving you access to more linked blocksAir supplies count as blocks! When you get an Air Supply and there is a block (or many blocks) above it, it will fall. So grab them quick and get back to drilling!Take your time! If you are just starting with Mr. Driller, take the time to learn how fast he jumps up blocks and moves left to right. This will prevent you from trying to drill out of the way of falling blocks rather than just moving out of the way.Boxes and rocks marked with an X don't link! If you see these falling, avoid them at all costs. Its also good to give some space before you start drilling right under one. [Actually this tip is incorrect, X-blocks do link like any other block, and it is how you're supposed to get rid of them when they are surrounding an air capsule.][CR]iPhone version[CR]Mr. Driller for iPhone seems to be an updated version of the original Mr. Driller, the main difference being that Susumu's in-game sprites have been redrawn to resemble the current artwork.The app is only 1.99 US and, like any iPhone app, is compatible with the iPad.[CR]",

The 2000 PSX/DC game is a sequel to                 Nightmare Creatures, in which players, once again, have to face the diabolical Adam Crowley. This time you play as Wallace; a man seeking to escape Crowley's genetics hospital, to save his girlfriend, Rachel and to, ultimately, seek revenge on Crowley.The impressive combo system from the first game has been simplified, the adrenaline bar has been removed and the option for Wallace to perform                fatality moves when certain enemy types are low on health make for a refreshed gameplay experience. The protagonist is still able to use various items such as shotguns, burning/freezing orbs etc. - however the supply in which they are available is much stricter than the first game should be used wisely. Basic gameplay like jumping, swimming or climbing to solve puzzles and traverse terrain remain intact from the first game as well.

                "plot": "Pen Pen Tri-icelon was a racing game for Dreamcast staring lovable penguins called Pen-Pens. The game's unique hook was that each of the four levels in the game featured three types of gameplay: Walking, Swimming, and Sliding. For the walking portions all you had to do was push the analog stick in the direction you wanted your Pen Pen to go, while occasionally jumping, swimming required you to press the A button for your character to do a forward stroke, sliding used essentially the same controls as swimming however it was more beneficial to tap A in a rhythmic fashion in order for your Pen Pen to get the most distance. The game featured four courses, each with five races. Three of these were difficulty variants while another would have you racing against characters of the same type, and the final one would have you race against the game's only hidden character. Each level from the medium difficulty onward would feature at least one (and in most cases just one) environmental hazard. These were particularly awkward because for the most part there was nothing you could do to avoid these hazards. For example, in the first level players would have to endure a wind storm whose main purpose seemed to randomize your positions with the other Pen Pens. Another difference between the difficulty levels was track length. Courses at higher difficulty levels were longer than ones at earlier levels, and featured four events rather than the normal three. Winning races would grant you accessories for you to decorate your Pen Pen with. These offered no noticeable gameplay benefit but were just for \"fun.\"[CR]",

As the first online console RPG, it was a highly anticipated release from Sonic Team. It allowed four players to play cooperatively through four zones (Forest, Caves, Mines, and Ruins). It also enabled players from different regions to group together with an in-game word selection system that automatically translated phrases to the party members' native languages.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Explosion inside the Central Dome.In the year 3060, after years of war and the destruction of the planet Coral, the Alliance of Nations send out probes to the far reaches of the galaxy. In the year 3068 they found a planet that could sustain life, it was named Ragol.A ship, Pioneer 1, was launched to establish a colony on the planet in 3076. In 3077 Pioneer 1 lands on Ragol and research begins on the planet and the Central Dome is constructed to be the colonies headquarters. Hunter Rico Tyrell is put in charge of the Surface Exploration Team.In 3082 contruction is finished on the initial colony and a message is sent to Coral letting them know it is time for Pioneer 2 to be launched. The next year as Pioneer 2 begins its long journey to Ragol a large number of the once peaceful animal population begin attacking colonists on the planet.To answer the new danger Rico Tyrell establishes the Hunters to protect Ragol's colonists and find the cause of the animals sudden rage. In 3084 Pioneer 2 enters orbit around Ragol. Just as the ship establishes contact an explosion inside the Central Dome occurs. The Principal, leader of Pioneer 2 then proceeds to send out his own Hunters to investigate.[CR]Character Classes[CR]PSO has 3 main classes (Hunter, Ranger, Force) which are then broken down into Subclasses based on race (Human, Newman, Cast) and sex (Male/Female).Humans are the most balanced of the races, they can use both Techniques (magic) and melee attacks. Newman are primarily magic users and have very low attack strength with melee weapons and low defensive stats. Casts are the robots of the universe, they cannot use magic but have high defense and the strongest melee attacks in the game.These are then broken down by job. Hunter is the melee damage dealer and uses short range, high damage weapons. Rangers deal moderate damage over long range with guns. Forces are technique users and are considered a support class, although at high levels they are capable of dealing area of effect damage.A Female Human Force.FOmarls have higher attack power than other forces. This made them competent up close and a more balanced class.A Female Newman Force.Fonewearls have very limited melee potential but they excel in both attack and support techniques. Out of all classes they have the highest mental strength which allows them to have more technique points then any other class.A Male Newman Force.FOnewms have the highest level attack techniques in the game and the lowest defense as well. The can deal massive damage at higher levels but are difficult to play as because they can become overwhelmed very quickly.A Male Cast Hunter.HUcasts are the strongest melee class in the game and deal mindblowing damage at high levels. Like other casts, they cannot use techniques.Male Human Hunter.HUmars are the most balanced of all characters. They have good defense and evasion and can deal high levels of damage with both melee and ranged weapons. They can use low to mid level attack and support techniques.A Female Newman Hunter.HUnewearls are better with techniques then their hunter counterparts but deal less damage both ranged and up close.A Female Cast Ranger.RAcaseals have the highest defense power out of all ranger types but cannot use techniques.RAcastA Male Cast Ranger.RAcasts have the highest potential attack power of all rangers. They cannot use techniques.A Male Human Ranger.RAmars have the most balanced stats of the ranger classes. Not highly skilled up close with melee weapons though. They can use multiple support and attack techniques but not with the same success as their force counterparts.[CR]Weapon Types[CR]PSO has a multitude of weapon types. There are three broad categories: Melee, Ranged, and Caster.Melee WeaponsClaw - Short range melee weapon worn on the right hand.Dagger - A short range melee weapon with very high attack speed and moderate damage.Fist - A short range melee weapon.Katana - Rare melee weapon with high damage and moderate range and speed.Partisan - A wide range melee weapon. Most partisan's deal moderate damage, have an extended range, and are quicker than other wide range weapons.Saber - A standard melee weapon, has moderate damage and moderate attack speed. Also moderate range.Dragon SlayerSword - A wide area of attack melee weapon that typically deals high damage while sacrificing attack speed.Double SaberTwin Saber - Fast attack speed with moderate damage and range.Ranged WeaponsHandgun - Standard ranged weapon, fast firing speed and recovery with low damage.Mechgun - Very fast firing ranged weapon. Fires three shots per burst, but has low damage and an extended recovery time.Rifle - High damage with moderate firing rate and recovery time.Shot -(Needle) Rifle -Slicer - Looks like a melee weapon, but actually flings out a ranged attack when swung.Caster WeaponsCane - A short range weapon capable of being swung like a saber, but is mostly used to increase a caster's magic attributes.Rod -Wand -[CR]Areas[CR]There are four areas in the original P.S.O. Players start in the Forest and work their way through the Caves, Mines, and finally the Ruins. Each area has between 2 to 4 sections that the players must travel through on their way to each boss at the end of an area.ForestThe forest zone is the first area the players are given access to, it is a fairly simple area with only 2 sections. Players must traverse through the forest on their way to the planets outpost. The boss fight takes place inside the abandoned colony.    DragonThe boss of the Forest area is simply referred to as \"Dragon.\" The Dragon first attacks with fire from both the ground and in flight. Later in the fight it will dive underground and tunnel towards the player.CavesIn the second area the players have gone underground. The Caves have a variety of reptile and insect themed enemies and a lot of the rooms incorporate lava in one way or another. The mini-boss in the caves is an odd creature called Pan Arms that splits into two halfway through the fight.    De Rol LeThe boss fight in the Caves area takes place on a moving platform. The boss swims either alongside, in front of, or behind the players platform. De Rol Le throws projectiles and can shoot a beam at the players while they attempt to defeat it. Ranged attacks are very useful for this battle.MinesThe mines features robotics enemies, some ranged and some melee. The mini-boss in the mines is a large mech called Garanz that has a variety of ranged attacks.     Vol OptVol Opt is mostly stationary, in fact the only movement it does is rotate while aiming at the players. In order to defeat Vol Opt players must attack the glowing blue portions while avoiding his primary and secondary attacks.RuinsThe Ruins is easily the largest area of the four and features the biggest variety of enemies. The mini-boss in the ruins is a Centaur-like creature that charges across the room towards the players.    Dark Falz Final FormDark Falz, being the final boss, is capable of dealing massive amounts of damage with both ranged attacks and long reaching melee attacks. He has two forms, the first of which is a grotesque creature with multiple tentacles, while the second has a more god-like appearance and is fought far above the original arena.On the lower difficulties players only see the first form of Dark Falz, in order to fight Dark Falz in his final form players must be on the higher difficulty levels.[CR]Mags[CR]BhiravaMags are support creatures that follow you around as long as you have one equipped. Every character receives one Level 1 Mag at the start of each game. Players can raise their mag into many different forms by feeding it the in-game items. Each class can raise different types of mags as well. What you feed a Mag will determine its final form as well as what types of powers and abilities it has. These powers range from high level attacks and support to randomly casted spells such as Resta (healing) or Shifta and Deband (attack and defense). From time to time a Mag can also revive a fallen character.[CR]Internet Time[CR]Phantasy Star Online used a globally compatible internet time system known as '.beats' (24 Hours divided into 1000 beats). It was implemented to aid users setting meeting times with other players from around the world, meaning a time of 'n' beats could be set ('n' being the number of beats), instead of having to work out each other's time zones.[CR]Other Technical Info[CR]1 PlayerModem Support/ Online MultiplayerVMU required: 45 blocks, 1 Character Per VMUVGA Box CompatibleKeyboard SupportJump Pack Compatible[CR]",

It contains new modes and content in addition to all the original content that was in in the original PSO game on the Dreamcast. It was also the first version of PSO to charge for online play ($4.99 a month but players had to pay for 3 months at a time). When the SegaNet servers were terminated in June of 2003, all PSO Version 2 subscribers were no longer able to play online, however within the game itself (via the WEBSITE menu) its is possible to setup a separate means of connecting to any server online. This allowed PSO players to continue playing in spite of SegaNet's downfall. Free private servers exist for those who wish to play online.  ChangesThe maximum character level was increased from 100 to 200. An online battle mode with several different rule variations was added. A challenge mode was added, requiring players to work together as a team to solve each area. If the player finished all nine stages under a certain time limit, they were given the opportunity to choose a weapon and name it. The \"Ultimate\" difficulty was added with considerably stronger monsters and altered stages. The previous difficulties were all rebalanced to insure players level up to level 100 faster. All of the classes' stats were rebalanced and some classes had the ability to use some weapons and techniques removed. The addition of many new weapons with considerably higher stats in contrast to those available in the original PSO. It was very difficult to do substantial damage to Ultimate level monsters with the older weapons in the online mode where enemies were considerably stronger (as opposed to the offline mode).  [CR]",

Though he is a pacifist who abhors fighting, Galuda has sworn revenge on the \"one-handed man\" who brought sickness to his people. Galuda's offensive and defensive abilities are high. He doesn't have any notable weaknesses, and aim for powerful throw moves!\"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Power Stone's gameplay revolves around players using melee attacks, the environment, and power stones to defeat their opponent.Melee CombatAll characters have a strong attack, weak attack, and a throw. As you could probably guess, a strong attack is more powerful than the weak attack, but is slower. The weak is the other way around with more speed, but lacks the power of the strong attack. You can string together the weak and strong attacks to perform combos. Every character has combos that are mostly unique to them, but you'll have to experiment to find them out (or find a handy faq somewhere). Throws are very powerful because the only thing that can block a throw is a throw. This them very useful for blocking the characters' \"super moves\" (pretty sure that's not the official term), because once a character initiates a super move they are vulnerable and can't do anything until the move is complete. This may sound like a big opening, but it is actually a very small opportunity. My point is: throws are very useful.EnvironmentThe characters of Power Stone can use the bare environment to attack their opponents. A basic ability for all characters is the  wall jump. Although the wall jump is useful, Instead of jumping off the wall when a character is up against the wall one can press the attack button and their character will launch off the wall and attack towards their enemy, this applies whenever the character is in the air or on the ground. The other part of the environment that is usable is the ceilings. You can jump up towards a ceiling and hang on to it and climb around. While hanging on the ceiling you can press the attack button and your character will launch downwards and in the general direction of the enemy, but the distance you can move with this attack is limited so it is best suited to nearby enemies.ObjectsWang-Tang using a rocket launcher and Rouge using a chair as weaponsObjects are the items that are already within the environment such as chairs and tables. There are two ways to interact with the objects that are in the area. They can either pick them up and throw them or just push them towards an opponent. Light objects can be interacted with by any character, but only a few characters can interact with the heavy objects normally. If any of these excluded characters wish to interact with a heavy object they must first collect three power stones and transform. Poles are a unique item. Poles are heavy objects that can only be swung around in a circle once when picked up, but players who can't pick them up can swing around them and then propel themselves towards the enemy to attack. Also, and character can jump and grab onto the pole which is useful for avoiding attacks. Also, when hanging on to a pole you can press the attack button and your character will launch towards his nemesis and attack.ItemsItems are the things that lie around the environment and can be used for things other than throwing it at your opponent. These items vary from guns, swords, a shield, a pole that very similar to  Goku's power pole, a flamethrower, bombs, and even food to restore your health. You start out with only so many items, but as you complete the story mode with different characters you can unlock many more. To use an item you simply press the button you use to pick up all things and then press an attack button to use it.Power StonesPower StoneAlthough in the story there is only one power stone in combat there are normally three (you can change it up to five). When the fight starts there will be two stones on the ground somewhere to collect and after a minute or so a third will appear. Whoever can collect all three (even if there are five you still only have to collect three) will transform. When you transform you attack, defense, and sometimes your speed will increase greatly and where the HUD shows your power stones will be a meter. The meter will go down with time and whenever you use an attack, so you overuse this powerful form. Your weak and strong attacks will change to either ranged attacks or melee attacks with a really long range. You also have two \"super moves\" (again pretty sure that's not official terminology) which can be activated by either squeezing the L or R trigger. Of course, each trigger does a different attack. These \"super moves\" will completely deplete the meter mention earlier so once it's over you will return to your normal self and the power stones will scatter.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]\"Sometime in the nineteenth century, superstitions and powerful legends run rampant. Located somewhere in the world are magic stones that can make any wish come true. These are the Power Stones!\" - NarratorAs with most fighting games the story doesn't exactly take center stage. The story centers around all of the characters trying to retrieve the power stone. Some do it for fortune, some for training, other for pride. The story comes to a conclusion when your character has to fight Valgas and he absorbs the power stone and becomes a monster called \"Final Valgas\" in the game. After defeating him you'll see a small comic book looking cutscene that will show the character's motive and what they actually do with it.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Teams are made up of three characters.The majority of Project Justice's fighting system is taken from Rival Schools with a few additions. This game adds a third character to player teams but the game remains a one-on-one fighter. The player can still execute a Team Up attack as in the first game but this time, the two light attack buttons will perform the attack with the player's A Partner, and the two heavy attack buttons will perform the attack with the player's B Partner. With the addition of a third character, comes two new gameplay enhancements; the ability to cancel a Team Up attack, and the Party Up attack. If a player successfully lands a Team Up attack, their opponent can opt for the chance to cancel it by initiating their own Team Up attack. Once this happens, the opponent is given 4 seconds to hit the player that initiated the attack; if they manage to land a hit on the initiating player, the Team Up attack is canceled. However, if they fail to land a hit or they take damage themselves, the attack continues. The Party Up attack involves all three members of a team attacking their opponent. The move varies depending on what High School the character initiating the attack is from.Team Up Attack!Also returning from Rival Schools is the Vigor meter which has been limited to a maximum level of 5 instead of 9 as in Rival Schools. Individual character Burning Vigor Attacks and Team Up cancels require 1 level of Vigor, Team Up techniques use 2 levels of Vigor, and Party Up techniques consume all 5 levels of Vigor. All of which use Vigor whether the attack is successfully landed or not.Project Justice also includes the defensive techniques from Rival Schools; The Tardy Counter and Attack Cancels. Tardy Counters allow the play to immediately attack from the blocking position. Any hard attack, special move, or Burning Vigor technique can be used as a Tardy Counter. Attack Counters occur when two players attack each other at the same time. This cancels out both attacks but will not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit combo or move.Game ModesMode descriptions as seen in the main menu.Setting up a League BattleArcade - Play the Arcade version here.

The player can choose anywhere from 2 to 6 characters for each fight but the game decides the available characters. The story is told before and after matches using 2D images and comic book like dialogue balloons. Certain schools have branching storylines that are effected by the players actions during a fight.Free Mode allows the player to select any three characters that have been unlocked to fight teams made of random characters until they reach the final boss. Once the final boss is defeated, the player is given stats of their performance and given a rank named after characters from the game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]A panel from the Story ModeIt has been a year since Hyo Imawano had taken over Justice High School in an attempt to take over Japan. Life had returned to normal until a series of attacks on students of different High Schools in the region had occured. Witnesses claimed that the attacks were being perpertrated by Batsu Ichimonji. Students from the attacked schools set out to find Batsu and make him answer for his crimes. Later it is discovered that Batsu was innocent and that the real culprit was Kurow Kirishima disguised as him (Vatsu). Batsu, Hinata, and Kyosuke confront Kurow and defeat him in battle. After the fight Kurow attempts to escape but is severely injured by Hyo Imawano. The Taiyo students encounter Hyo who becomes possessed by his father Mugen Imawano and is consumed by hatred and evil. Before his possession fully takes hold of his mind, Hyo begs Kyosuke to end their father's influence on him in one final battle. In the Taiyo High School ending involving Burning Batsu, Hyo dies in Kyosuke's arms. Kurow is admitted to a near by hospital but later escapes and is unable to be found. Tormented by the loss of his brother, Kyosuke disappears into seclusion leaving Batsu and his fellow students behind.The game features different endings for each of the different High Schools but all follow the same basic storyline.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Taiyo High SchoolBatsu IchimonjiHinata WakabaKyosuke KagamiHayato NekketsuRan HibikiChairpersonGorin High SchoolSchool Select screen in the Story ModeShoma SawamuraNatsu AyuharaRoberto MiuraNagare NamikawaMomo KaruizawaGedo High SchoolDaigo KazamaEiji \" Edge\" YamadaGan IsurugiPacific High SchoolPacific High School students Tiffany, Roy, and Boman (left to right)Boman DelgadoRoy BromwellTiffany LordsSeijyun Girls High SchoolAkira KazamaYurika KirishimaAoi \"Zaki\" HimezakiJustice High SchoolHideo ShimazuKyoko MinazukiUnlockable / Alternate CharactersDemon HyoHyo ImawanoKurow KirishimaBurning Batsu (a more powerful Batsu)Vatsu (Kurow disguised as Batsu.

You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.[CR]Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.[CR]The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo~n is the fourth game of the Puyo Puyo series of competitive puzzle games. (The Japanese word for four is \"yon,\" hence the title of the game.) Unlike the previous games, spinoffs aside, Puyo Puyo~n is exclusive to home consoles. The game was first released on the Sega Dreamcast on March 4, 1999; N64 and PS1 versions were released in December of the same year, while the Game Boy Color version was released on September 22, 2000. Puyo Puyo~n is one of the last Puyo Puyo games to be developed by Compile.Yo~n ignores most of the changes introduced in Puyo Puyo Sun, instead adding new character-specific super powers to Puyo Puyo Tsu's ruleset.[CR]Game Rules[CR]The core basics of the game are similar to previous entries. Each player is given a 12x6 field. Pairs of different-colored Puyo drop into the field; when four Puyo are connected either horizontally or vertically, they will disappear from the field. Popping Puyo sends gray Nuisance Puyo, which can only be destroyed by an adjacent set of cleared Puyo, to the top of the opponent's field. After the opponent places their current pair of Puyo onto the field, the accumulated Nuisance Puyo will drop down. If the player clears Puyo with Nuisance at the top of their field, the amount of garbage that would've been sent to the opponent is instead deducted from their Nuisance total; this is called \"offsetting.\" The player who is physically unable to bring more Puyo to the field (thanks to having their third-from-left column clogged) loses.Puyo Puyo~n's new feature is the \"Super Attack.\" Super Attacks are powerful character-specific abilities that usually clear large amounts of Puyo from the field. Activating a Super Attack requires a stock (built by clearing Puyo) and the sacrifice of the currently-controlled pair of Puyo.The Game Boy Color version of the game differs from other versions by retaining the rules of Puyo Puyo Sun. Whenever either player offsets Puyo, a number of \"Sun Puyo\" fall into both players' fields. These Puyo, which are cleared in the same manner as Nuisance Puyo, boost the total amount of garbage that is sent to the opponent.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Modes[CR]Puyo Puyo~n includes the standard single player, multiplayer, and Endless modes. The single player mode once again stars Arle Nadja; after Carbuncle goes missing during a magic show, Arle embarks on a quest to find him. Each stage features different rulesets, occasionally making use of Hard Puyo (which must be cleared multiple times to disappear) and Point Puyo (which gives a score bonus, and consequentially a Nuisance bonus, when cleared). Arle cannot use her own Super Power in this mode but gains the help of Draco Centauros, Seriri, Witch and Chiko as the player advances.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Below is a list of the playable characters and their respective Super Attacks.Arle Nadja - Nuisance Puyo do not fall in her field for 15 seconds.Skeleton T - Receives a steadily-increasing Nuisance bonus, so long as he does not rotate his Puyo.Archan - Removes 12 Puyo from the field at random.Kikimora - All Nuisance Puyo are removed.Panotty - All non-connected Puyo are removed.Draco Centauros - All Puyo that are the same type of the highest-placed Puyo are removed. This includes Nuisance Puyo.Nohoho - All Puyo are shuffled column-by-column in a slot machine-like manner.Seriri - All non-connected Puyo change to match the color of the most numerous Puyo type.Suketoudara - All Puyo that are of the most numerous color change to the second-most-numerous color.Harpy - Each Nuisance Puyo changes to a random color.Witch - The tallest column is cleared.Dragon - The Puyo in the tallest column change to the most numerous color.Chico - The Puyo in rows 4 and 8 change to the most numerous color.Schezo Wegey - Removes Puyo in a 6x6 X-shape from the bottom of his field.Rulue - Her field is turned upside down and all Nuisance Puyo are removed.Satan - The Puyo in rows 6-9 and columns 3-4 are removed.Doppelganger Arle - Nuisance Puyo do not fall in her field for 30 seconds.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Unlike previous games in the series, Quake III: Arena is a multiplayer focused game and has a barebones single player campaign. The objective of Quake III: Arena is to frag enemy players and score points by completing objectives based on the game mode's current objective. If the player is fragged he instantly respawns with full health and gets straight back into the action but loses any weapons/ powerups that were in his possesion. A game ends once the frag or time limit is reached. In the single player portion of the game players battle through 7 tiers of maps, facing various numbers of bots. There are awards for things such as killing enemies with a gauntlet, getting multiple frags in a short amount of time and having a high accuracy. There is also varying degrees of difficulty, including:I Can Win (easiest)Bring It OnHurt Me PlentyHardcoreNightmare! (hardest)[CR]Singleplayer tiers[CR]These are seven different tiers in singleplayer mode.Tier 0 - IntroductionOpponent - CrashTier 1 - TraineeOpponents - Ranger, Phobos, Mynx, Orbb, SargeTier 2- SkilledOpponents - Bitterman, Grunt, Hossman, Daemia, HunterTier 3- CombatOpponents - Gorre, Wrack, Angel, Slash, KleskTier 4 - WarriorOpponents - Lucy, Tank Jr, Biker, Patriot, AnarkiTier 5 - VeteranOpponents - Razor, Visor, Stripe, Keel, UrielTier 6 - MasterOpponents - Bones, Cadaver, Doom, Sorlag, MajorTier 7 - EliteOpponent - XaeroGameplay modesQuake III features four different gameplay modes that can be played with bots and humans. They are:Free for All (FFA) - Deathmatch, person with the highest amount of kills wins.Team Deathmatch (TDM) - Two teams compete for the most kills.Tournament - 1v1 Deathmatch with spectators. A tournament structure, allowing for multiple people to compete.Capture the Flag (CTF) - Two teams try to capture eachothers' flags while defending their own.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The Quake III weapon list borrows from both the Doom and Quake franchises.GauntletGauntletThe Gauntlet is essentially an electrified hand mounted saw blade. Used as a last resort melee weapon, it does about 50 damage per hit, and can usually frag an enemy in 2 or 3 hits depending on health and armor values. Given the fast paced nature of Quake III, the Gauntlet is rarely ever used as people can easily avoid it. Also, surprise melee kills are almost impossible due to the weapon's loud noise when in use. However, when a player kills somebody with the Gauntlet, the killing player is awarded a Humiliation point, which comes with its own separate icon. Multiple Humiliation icons stack up depending on the amount of kills, encouraging continued melee kills.MachinegunMachinegunThe Machinegun is the weapon every freshly spawned player starts with. Like any other Machinegun, you pull the trigger and bullets come out at high velocity. At about 7 damage per shot, and a very high firing rate, the Machinegun is a fairly weak but serviceable starter weapon. It is good for finishing off opponents with low health on long distances.ShotgunShotgunAs the name implies, the Shotgun in Quake III performs like one would expect a shotgun to: it fires a cone of 10 lead pellets. Each pellet does 10 damage, totaling up to a possible 110 points of damage, making the Shotgun very effective at close range. Also, it's got a laser sight - deal with it.Grenade LauncherGrenade LauncherThe Grenade Launcher fires pineapple sized \"pineapples\", which bounce around for a few seconds until exploding . However, if a grenade comes in contact with a player it immediately explodes, bringing about the term \"grenade swallowing.\" While the latter is hard to accomplish, the Grenade Launcher is primarily used for littering a key area (items such as Red Armor or Mega Health) with very unpredictable grenades that makes it tough for your opponent to get out without taking damage.Rocket LauncherRocket LauncherThe staple of Quake III: Arena is the rocket launcher. Firing explosive rocket projectiles, the real draw of the rocket launcher is it's splash damage. While it's easy to avoid a rocket, it's harder to avoid the explosion the rocket causes. Because of this, most Rocket Launcher wielding players will try to aim at the ground or nearby walls around a target. The rocket launcher is the most effective way in Quake III to leave your enemy in a shower of gibs. Not only used as a weapon, the explosive effect of the Rocket Launcher allows players to launch themselves up into the air. Combined with jumping (known as rocket jumping), this allows players to reach places inaccessible through regular jumping. Certain professional players have developed a skill towards avoiding rocket fire commonly described by the community as being rocket scientists.Lighting GunLightning GunReturning from the original Quake, the lightning gun is almost like a flamethrower, yet instead of discharging a plume of fire, it shoots out a beam of lightning. The lightning beam is also instantaneous and does not deteriorate from where the crosshair is aimed, making it more powerful in the hands of a player with good aim. The Lightning gun is suitable for medium range combat since it has a maximum reach.RailgunRailgunLike it's Quake II predecessor, the Railgun fires a depleted uranium slug at extreme velocities, dealing massive damage. The railgun is Quake III version of a sniper rifle; highly accurate, and extremely lethal - however because of its long recharge time, it is very dangerous to use in close combat. The Railgun leaves trail, making it very effective for tournament commentary and viewership. The Railgun is the most common weapon used in the various Instagib mods for Quake IIIPlasmagunPlasmagunFirst found in Doom, the plasma gun acts like the Machinegun, spewing out orbs of plasma at a high rate of fire, which do a moderate amount of damage along with a small radius of splash damage. Because of this it has allowed some skilled players to \"plasma climb\", firing the Plasma gun underneath them against a wall to \"climb\" up walls. The Plasmagun is one of the strongest weapons in the game (but also very hard to master) and is especially deadly in tight corridors.BFG 10KBFG 10kWhile previous versions of the BFG fired slow moving balls of energy, the BFG operates as a souped up version of the Plasmagun. The BFG fires large bolts of plasma at a high rate of fire, causing even the most heavily armored characters to turn to gibs in only 2-3 well placed shots.[CR]Medals[CR]Medals are awarded to players for high skill play in the matches. Upon receiving a medal, it is displayed on the character's head showing the icon.ExcellentThis medal is awarded for killing more than two players in a row in two seconds. Because this medal can be stacked, it's possible to receive medals very quickly if there are a huge number of players playing.ImpressiveA medal that is achieved once a player uses the Railgun and kills two players in a row. Again, this medal can also be stacked so killing more players in a row with the Railgun will result in receiving more \"Impressive\" medals.PerfectThis medal is gained once a match is over and a player does not get killed at all. A near impossible medal to receive in a multiplayer match.HumiliationConsidering that majority of all weapons are used for shooting at distances, the gauntlet can still be used to kill enemies and the announcer would shout: \"Humiliation\", to confirm the kill. Can be stacked so that more medals can be received by using the gauntlet.AccuracyWhen the accuracy of shots is above 50% in a match, this medal is awarded.FragsAfter reaching 100 frags, a medal is awarded and can be stacked. The counter is shown every 100 with a number and can be seen when accessing the Single Player mode.Holy shit !While it isn't a medal, the announcer will shout \"HOLY SHIT\" when you frag an opponent who is just meters away from scoring a point in Capture the Flag.[CR]Modifications[CR]Like previous Quake games, Quake III: Arena has a strong mod community. There are countless modifications, ranging from small tweaks to total conversions. Some of the more popular mods are:CPMA (Challenge Promode Arena) - Competitive feature set. Supports a large variety of game modes (including Rocket Arena) and two gameplay styles (Vanilla Q3 and Promode).Defrag - Allows players to engage in trick-jumping.Rocket Arena - Round based game mode, every player starts with all weapons and armor in teams of twoUrban Terror - Tactical-shooting experience (Free, stand-alone game).OSP (Orange Smoothie Productions) - Competitive feature set (deprecated, see CPMA).[CR]Ports and other versions[CR]Quake III Arena (Dreamcast)Quake III Arena on DreamcastDeveloped by Raster Productions for the Sega Dreamcast game console, Quake 3 became one of the flagship titles for Sega's online service by making use of either the dial-up modem or the Broadband Adapter sold separately. Up to four players can play offline through split-screen multiplayer. There were several compromises made in order for the game to run on the platform, such as bringing the total player count down to four players offline and online. When more players play on one console, the choices of levels shrink due to memory limitations of the platform. Certain levels were altered due to system limitations or for a more streamlined experience.The Dreamcast version offers several control schemes, including support for the regular controller, the MadCatz Panther DC, as well as proprietary Dreamcast keyboard and mouse accessories. Each control accessory plugged in can be mapped to any active player. For example, four individual control types can be mapped to four active players. A mouse and keyboard can be paired to one active player, which allows two player split-screen gameplay with two keyboards and two mice. You can even set four mice to four separate players for mouse-only combat. Keyboard control allows for text messaging during online gameplay to talk with other players or team members in team games. Only one player per console can play online.The game also features exclusive content including levels made just for the Dreamcast version including one level provided exclusively to paying SegaNet members and VMU mini games that unlock cheat codes for offline gameplay based on progression in the Single Player game and difficulty played.The Dreamcast version also introduced a cross-play feature, allowing Dreamcast users to play against PC users. Quake III: RevolutionQuake III: RevolutionThis is the incarnation of Quake 3 for the PlayStation 2 game console. Revolution plays really close to its PC brethren except for controls and just a few tweaks. One of the greater and most innovative things about this version is the campaign and being able to build up your characters in a RPG-esque manner. The game supports up to four players offline in split-screen gameplay through a multi-tap adapter.Quake LiveQuake LiveQuake Live (known as Quake Zero during development) was announced at Quakecon in 2007. Quake Live is an updated ad-supported free version of Quake III: Arena which runs in a browser window.   Quake Arena ArcadeQuake Arena ArcadeQuake Arena Arcade was officially announced by Id Software at QuakeCon 2007. An ESRB listing at the time confirmed that Pi Studios, notable for work with the Call of Duty franchise, would be handling the port. Development then went silent until February of 2009 when John Carmack stated that Quake Arena Arcade was \"very close\" to finished. The game was eventually released to XBLA on December 15, 2010 to tepid critical response due primarily to a lack of local split-screen play and connection issues on Xbox Live.

It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others,[citation needed] helping add to the authenticity of the game.[CR]The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rayman 2: The Great Escape is a 3D platformer that was developed by Ubisoft and first released in 1999. Players take control of Rayman, a limbless hero whose main attack is shooting his fists and energy balls at his opponents. This is the first Rayman game to be made in 3D. Rayman's powers include shooting his fists (which take the form of energy balls) and his helicopter ears (which allow him to descend slowly, and sometimes fly). He is also able to grab onto ledges and attain new heights via the use of purple lums. Lastly, he is able to innovate, riding a plum down a river of lava, riding on the back of a rocket, flying with a flaming gunpower barrel, and hitching a ride attached to a swamp creature named Ssssam.Unlike its predecessor, Rayman 2's visual design and score strike a much more dark and dreary tone, while still not taking away the mystifying and vibrant universe that is iconic to the Rayman games. Levels range from marshlands to oceanic bays to crazy dreamworlds to lava temples and robot pirate ship grottoes.Rayman 2 received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the fact that the series managed to make the transition from 2D to 3D much more seamlessly than a number of other similar platformers.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]On a dark and stormy night, Ly the Fairy reaches out to Rayman for help. The world is in trouble. Admiral Razorbeard and his pirate army have taken over most of the world and enslaved its inhabitants. Unfortunately, Rayman has been captured and put aboard the pirate ship Buccaneer. His friend Globox is thrown into a room with him shortly after, and Rayman remarks to his old friend that he feels weak, and that this may be the end. Luckily, Globox had been given a silver lum by Ly, which in turn he gives to Rayman. It rejuvenates him, and together they bust out of the ship.After a long trip down, Rayman lands in the Woods of Light, one of the few places the pirates have not infiltrated. Globox is nowhere to be found, but Rayman does come into contact with Murfy, who provides him with guidance. He also finds the Teensies, who show him the way to the Hall of Doors. Once there, Rayman travels to the Fairy Glade, where he saves a weakened Ly the Fairy from the pirates. He then learns how dire the situation really is. The pirates hold sway in almost all corners of the world. Razorbeard has also split the heart of the world into 1000 lums and scattered them throughout.To set things right, Rayman needs to find the 4 masks of power. Only by having these 4 masks can he summon Polokus, the creator of the world, who will then be able to destroy the pirates once and for all. As soon as Rayman gets this information, he is off. Along the way, he will encounter much resistance, many challenges, and a pirate captain bent on the destruction of his world. No problem, for a hero without limbs.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Rayman 2 features an array of imaginative and colorful characters, perfectly complementing the exciting gameplay experience.RaymanRayman is an unsuspecting hero who is dragged into the fight against the pirates, while also being responsible for repairing the damage that has been done to the world through the collection of items known as lums. Clearly the plight of the world is close to his heart, as he is friends to a number of the creatures of the forest including Globox and Ly. GloboxGlobox is a dear friend of Rayman that you first encounter at the beginning of the game as you help him to escape from his pirate cell. Despite being a huge coward, Globox can often be useful throughout the game with his ability to use magic, an example being his special \u2018rain-dance\u2019. MurfyFollowing the tradition of many games in the platforming genre, Rayman 2 also features a tutorial fairy, known as Murfy. Responsible for introducing the player to various game mechanics and items, Murfy clearly is an important ally for those new to the game. Murfy can be summoned by the player standing on his corresponding tile. LyLy the fairy is another friend of Rayman who helps him out in a different way to Murfy. During their first encounter (in which Rayman rescues Ly from being held captive by the pirates), Ly gives Rayman the power to use purple lums. Ly also helps to grant Rayman greater power throughout the progress of the game, through items known as silver lums. RazorbeardRazorbeard is the leader of the evil robot pirates, and forms an inexplicably evil adversary to Rayman. With an army of giant airships and hordes of evil minions he clearly poses a great threat to the sanctity of the world. His evil deeds know no bounds, as we discover that he has imprisoned many of the creatures of the land and has ravaged the world of its magical power (the lums), which Rayman must find scattered throughout the world. PolokusPolokus is an ancient being that sits on a totem in the Spirit World awaiting the four magic masks, which Rayman is required to locate. Only after awakening the spirit of Polokus does Rayman truly stand a chance of defeating the pirates. ClarkThe buff, broad-shouldered, balloon-chinned giant known as Clark is another friend of Rayman. He is first encountered in the Menhir Hills level, where he asks Rayman to bring him medicine from the Cave of Bad Dreams. After he has been cured, he allows Rayman to ride on top of his back as he smashes through walls. He returns later in the game in a mind-controlled state as a mini-boss that Rayman must defeat. CarmenCarmen the whale is another odd friend of Rayman who is also captured by the pirates and must be freed by Rayman. In the PlayStation version Carmen leads Rayman to the Temple of Water and Ice; in all other versions she leads him out of the level. SssssamSssssam the snake acts as the ferryman of the glades. He is trapped in a cage by the evil pirates, but is rescued by Rayman during the game. To show his gratitude, Sssssam then gives Rayman a ride through the Marshes of Awakening along a treacherous water ski-like course, at the end of which he leaves Rayman to continue his adventure alone.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]PlayStationThe PlayStation version only featured fewer lums to collect as well as truncated level design to compensate for the system hardware. This version also features enemies and boss fights not seen in any other version including an enemy last seen in the original Rayman. Along with the PlayStation 2 version, the game featured complete voice overs for the dialogue.Nintendo 64Nintendo 64 US BoxartThe Nintendo 64 version featured compatibility with the N64 Expansion Pak. It also featured music converted and fitted to work with the hardware as the other versions used CD audio. This was also the base version of Rayman DS and is similar to the PC version.PC/WindowsThe PC version looks and sounds great. However it does not feature any of the enhancements seen in the Dreamcast version.The PC version runs similar to the Nintendo 64 version retaining some features from the disc based versions. It can run at high resolutions and features the best quality sound out of all the other versions. The PC version suffers from a few issues such as un-customizable controls for both keyboard and joystick/gamepads and the installer is incompatible with 64-bit processors and cannot be installed on such platforms. This version is currently available for purchase on GOG.com and is able to run on 64-bit systems due to a different installer wrapper. It was also given free to pre-purchase owners of Rayman Origins on Steam.Sega DreamcastThe Dreamcast release runs at 60 frames per second maximum.The Dreamcast version is considered the best version of the game with higher resolution graphics, fast framerate, and extra features including online downloadable content such as mini games and a 4 player multiplayer mode. Levels are given additional geometry and effects to take advantage of the hardware compared to the versions released before. This version added 6 Globox Crystals hidden in a few levels that could be taken to the Globox Village to unlock bonuses. This was also the base version of Rayman 3D.Playstation 2 (Rayman 2 Revolution)Environments are given a substantial upgrade over every other version of the game.The Playstation 2 version was an even further enhanced version of Rayman 2 running on the Renderware engine. Graphics were given more detail, levels were expanded and the world map was replaced with a hub world that would also feature a more prominent appearance of other characters such as Clark and Carmen. Cutscenes are expanded and is given speech for all supported languages and features more detailed \"Raymanian\" speech. This version also suffers from some framerate issues and sound glitches. Currently this version of the game is available for download on the Playstation Store for Playstation 3 owners.Nintendo DS (Rayman DS)Rayman DS US Cover ArtRayman 2 was ported to the DS soon after it's launch under the name \"Rayman DS\" to capitalize on the launch window of the Nintendo DS system and intended to take advantage of the success similar to Rayman Advance on Game Boy Advance. Converted from the Nintendo 64 version by DC Studios, it faced several conversion issues. For example due to the smaller cartridge size, certain textures are compressed and certain indicators are unintelligible due to improper scaling. Much like Super Mario 64's DS, players could utilize the touch screen as a replicated analog control stick, but was criticized as being too imprecise.Nintendo 3DS (Rayman 3D)The 3DS port was rushed for launch of the system and suffers from a number of performance issues.The Nintendo 3DS version was converted from the Sega Dreamcast version and makes use of the analog slide pad for analog control and the system's 3D capabilities.The difficulty has been toned down to better adapt for quick play on the handheld format similar to the DSi port of the original Rayman. The game now saves after each section or cutscene, Rayman rotates with the camera when holding left or right on the D-Pad to turn the camera, health refills after being inflicted with instant death and certain sections have been altered for easier progress. The game was poorly adapted to the hardware to make it in time for system launch and has received numerous faults. The framerate is wildly inconsistent and sluggish at more intense areas, sound effects are missing or cut out during normal gameplay while music sounds overdriven, certain skybox textures alias incorrectly, certain scenery and objects are incorrectly scaled, and texture work sometimes appears stretched or missing. Reports indicated prior to launch that the 4 player mini game would return for local wireless multiplayer, however it does not exist in the final version as the Dreamcast DLC, Globox Village and collectables associated with it have been removed from this version.iPhone/iPadGameloft has converted the game to the iPhone which is also compatible with iTouch, and iPad. Controls are entirely touch based with \"Virtual\" joysticks and key actions mapped to the screen.Some boss characters, such as Colossus and Ninjaws do not appear in every version. Interactive cut-scenes are also cut from certain versions.[CR]Game Boy Color Version (Rayman 2 Revolution)[CR]Most of Rayman's moves resembe the powers seen in the first Rayman game on 32-bit platforms.Much like Rayman 1 on Game Boy Color, Rayman 2 saw an 8-bit portable rendition on Nintendo's handheld and features new levels and content. In the US, it shared the same name as the major console version. Whereas in the UK, it was named Rayman 2 Revolution but is not to be confused with the Playstation 2 version. Playing similarly to Rayman on Game Boy Color, creatures are locked away in cages and must be freed by Rayman in order to fight back the pirate army. Unlike the last Game Boy title, the password system was replaced by a battery back-up save system to keep and restore progress and does not contain any Ubi-Key features.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]Windows 95/98Pentium 133 (Min.)4x CD-ROM drive (Min.)32 MB RAM (Min.)4MB D3D compatible graphics card.DirectX compatible sound card.300MB free hard drive space.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Re-Volt is a racing game in which players take control of a variety of remote controlled cars (24 in total) and race them on 14 tracks featuring realistic environments such as museums, toy stores, gardens, and suburban neighborhoods. Like many similar games, there were powerups your car could collect to either give yourself an advantage or slow down an opponent.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]The game features six different single player game modes:ChampionshipThe player completes multiple races in order to unlock the next three tracks, earning points towards a total based on their finishing position in each race. Although you have a fixed number of laps to race you are allowed to choose the difficulty of the game. There are four different championships to beat: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Each victory in a championship unlocks new cars and the next set of tracks.Single RaceIn this mode you can drive the tracks reverse, mirrored or both at the same time against the computer AI.PracticeIn this mode, there are no opponents or obstacles, and the player is free to drive around the track at his or her leisure. There is a star hidden in a hard-to-reach location of each level. Collecting these stars unlocks more vehicles.Time TrialThis mode gives the player a set challenge lap time to beat. By attaining these challenge times, players unlock new cars.Stunt ArenaThe stunt arena is a map exclusive to this mode, and features a loop, many jumps, and a large halfpipe. There are twenty stars hidden throughout the map, and the Clockwork Carnage mode is unlocked when all of the stars have been collected.Clockwork CarnageIn Clockwork Carnage, the player races against twenty-nine other AI opponents. Every player uses the same small, very light, wind-up car.[CR]Cars[CR]Re-Volt has thirty-four cars (not counting custom cars) in the PC version of the game, all with different attributes and sorted into five classes, Rookie, Amateur, Advanced, Semi-Pro, and Pro. As one completes challenges for specific levels of tracks, new cars are unlocked. For instance in order to unlock all of the Advanced Cars, a player must complete the Silver Championship, find all of the practice stars in the new tracks in the championship, and place first in a single race on each one.While there is a large variety of cars in the game, one car is particularly notable for being the best, namely the Pro car Toyeca. In multiplayer matches and overall, Toyeca has the best combination of speed and handling, and is unquestionably the best car to use. This has led to the other cars being completely ignored for the purposes of competitive multiplayer.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The multiplayer mode in Re-Volt consists of two modes, Single Race and Battle Tag.In Battle Tag mode you start in one of four Arenas, which are reworked versions of the single player maps. The goal in this mode is to obtain a star, which is placed on the map. Every player has a countdown timer, and when one player has possession of the star, the timer counts down. The winner is the player who manages to keep the star until his or her timer runs out. Other players can take the star away from you by bumping into you. Your position on the map is given away on the other players' HUD as long as the star is in your possession.Single Races are just like the races in single player mode, with the computer players being replaced by human players. The player limit on the console versions is four players, while the PC version allows for up to twelve player races. On consoles the game is played via split screen, while on PC one can play the game via TCP/IP online or in your local network. Microsoft's Zone service as well as the GameSpy Arcade were alternate ways to play this game online.[CR]Customization[CR]The PC version of the game is notable for the plethora of custom cars and levels that have been created by the fanbase using the in-game tools (which include a custom track editor and a hidden in-game editing tool) as well as PC modeling programs. A small community has developed dedicated to creating completely original cars as well as repaints of the cars in-game, as well as levels that, in some cases, have been created from scratch.[CR]Re-Volt Online[CR]During the development of Microsoft's online gaming platform Xbox Live, Re-Volt was the first game to be playable online. The game was accessible for Microsoft executives and the press to demonstrate the new service, including competitive online multiplayer and voice chat.With the five year anniversary of Xbox Live in 2007, Microsoft released an official farewell tribute to Re-Volt on its homepage.[CR]Heritage[CR]The license and publishing rights to Re-Volt were bought in 2006 by the Canadian game publisher Throwback Entertainment. The publisher also confirmed that a next-generation version of the game is to be expected.[CR]iOS[CR]Big Bit released a port of Re-Volt to iOS. Nick Baynes of Big Bit initially hinted at a launch of the port in the weeks around September 2012. \"Re-Volt Classic\" for iOS was released on October 4th, 2012 with support for iPhone and iPad.[CR]",

The game was released on June 15, 1997. The game was re-released for the Dreamcast in 1999 with a visual mode that included pictures and photos to accompany the story, but this version of the game also relies entirely upon sound and audio cues for gameplay.The game came as a result of contact that Eno had with blind and visually impaired fans of WARP games. Eno was fascinated that the visually impaired would be fans of his games. He thought his games were very visually rich. He even went so far as to contact some of these fans to find out how they played his games if they could not see the games. As a result Eno decided to make a game that would be audio only, with no graphics at all.Real Sound: Kaze no Regret was a very large influence on further games from Kenji Eno and WARP, Inc. Games that came afterward from the company would take gameplay elements from Real Sound. Enemy Zero featured invisible enemies that could only be through sound. D2, also from WARP, included parts of the game where the player's character was rendered blind and the player must rely on sound, following a voice to get through the game. D2 also featured a sequence where the character was rendered deaf.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret's story and plot revolve around a love story; the love story between Mizu Sakura and Hiroshi Nonoiti. The two characters meet while still very young in school and fall in love. Mizu and Hiroshi decide to meet one evening to elope. Mizu does not show up at the clock tower where they planned to meet and shortly afterward is transferred to a new school, separated from Hiroshi. The two characters meet coincidentally again. The game continues to follow the characters as Hiroshi is a college student and as Mizu is looking for a job and is starting her career.The game features the voices of Ai Maeda, an anime voice actress, and Miho Kanno, a Japanese actress and idol singer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret is a completely spoken and audio game, as a result the game's game play elements were unique and different than most games that came before it. The player would listen to the game's story, similar in manner to a radio play, and would be prompted at particular times to make decisions in the branching storyline. These decisions would be prompted by an audible chime. Some have described the game play as almost like an audio \"choose your own adventure\" game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Real Sound ~The Wind's Regret~ The MusicThe soundtrack to Kaze no Regret was composed by Keiichi Suzuki, who is most known for his work on the MOTHER series. It was distributed by Pony Canyon and released August 20, 1997. The song 'Takeyama's Wanderings' was written by Kenji Eno.Real Sound ~The Wind's Regret~ The MusicTotal length: 70:55The Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Piano VersionA New NostalgiaThe Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Quartet VersionLet's Go by TransportHer Name is IzumiAn Empty PlaceMorning SaxophoneWas It the Same DreamHer Name is AsamiWeather Forecast 1Weather Forecast 2Weather Forecast 3Weather Forecast 4Izumi's Question MarkWhat a Fool I Am (Ambient Version)A Sad and Beautiful TimeThe Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Piano Version by NanaIzumi's SuspicionNana RunsTakeyama's WanderingsFragments of NostalgiaNostalgic AmbienceCardboard songDriving HighWhat a Fool I AmThe Wind's Regret Main Theme ~ Orchestra VersionRegret[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Real Sound: Kaze no Regret was to be the first game in a three part trilogy of audio only adventure games to be created by WARP. The second game in the series was to be titled Real Sound: Kiri no Orgel (\"Mists of the Music Box\"). Advertisements even appeared for the game in some Japanese video game magazines. The game was under development by the company but was never completed supposedly due to problems with voice and sound compression. The game was to be a horror game.The third game in the Real Sound trilogy was to be a comedy game, Spy Lunch. The game never made it past the planning stages and development never fully began.Real Sound: Kaze no Regret to this day is still very popular with the visually impaired and the blind as it is one of the few such video(?) games ever released.One branch of the possible storyline for Kaze no Regret was broadcast in its entirety on the radio in Japan.[CR]",

The only way to stop them is to gather famous heroes from Lodoss War universe and to defeat the evil ones in a battle.[CR]Record of Lodoss War is quite similar to  Diablo gameplay-wise. It is an action RPG which is heavily combat-oriented. You can directly control only the main hero, while the legendary heroes who join him on the quest are controlled by the AI. As you go through the game you level up, tweak your items with the great Ancients system, and gain new spells. It is also possible to froge weapons and to imbue them with runes. As your adventures into the surrounding land go on, you can return to your HQ, the Goblin Fortress, and get much needed healing and healing potions (free of charge).",

                "title_clean": "Resident Evil - Code - Veronica",
                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Resident Evil: Code: Veronica is the fourth mainline Resident Evil game, leading directly after the events of Resident Evil 2 as protagonist Claire Redfield continues her search for her brother, Chris Redfield. She is inadvertently captured by Umbrella, however, although a conveniently timed attack unto the base she is held allows her a chance to make her escape.Code: Veronica X, which was released only a year later on PlayStation 2, is an upgraded port from the original Dreamcast release. It plays the exact same, though it features a couple of added cutscenes--both involving the series sinister villain Albert Wesker--and minor graphical updates, including Steve Burnside receiving a redone hairstyle.Code: Veronica X is thusly viewed as the 'true' rendition of the game and is the version that was ported over to the GameCube, and which underwent the HD treatment with the Resident Evil Revival Collection alongside Resident Evil 4.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] & ControlsCode: Veronica is notable for featuring 3D environments as opposed to pre-renderedMuch like previous main Resident Evil entries, Code: Veronica mixes in third-person combat, exploration and puzzle solving. Code: Veronica only has the one storyline, like Resident Evil 3: Nemesis before it.The combat continues to confine the player to the ground when firing their weapon, and the notorious tank controls are still in effect. Players must also once again move via a series of pre-determined camera angles, though auto-aim is turned on by default, allowing players a means to note if there are enemies outside of their vision. Simultaneously pressing down and the 'run' button will have the player character perform an immediate 180 degree turn.Code: Veronica marks the first time that the series enters into full 3D, with the environments now being made up of polygons as opposed to the pre-rendered backgrounds of old. Veronica is also much lengthier than previous games on average, to perhaps account for its single storyline.Despite being the fourth game in the series and released after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Veronica ended up making a few steps back in terms of available mechanics and features. Nearly all of the updates brought about from Resident Evil 3 aren't apart of the game--because they were both developed at the same time causing a dissonance between the two--such as players being able to create their own ammo, live-selection choices, and the dodge maneuver. Though destructible barrels still persist and can be shot to deal a great degree of damage to any nearby enemies - including the player too if they're within range of the explosion.There are a couple of dual-wielding firearms available to wield in the gameThough what's especially notable is the fact that walking up/down staircases is once again automated and can't be performed manually. Zombies, however, can freely walk up/down staircases at will, which will also result in the player having to wait for it to make its ascent/descent before they can then use the staircase themselves.Gore has been slightly toned down. Zombies heads no longer have the capability to explode like in previous Resident Evils, nor can their limbs fall off. When shot with a magnum, or a close-range shotgun blast to the head, the zombie's head would gush out blood but still stay intact.Playable CharactersWhile only featuring the one selectable story, Veronica still includes two main playable characters. For the first half of the game players take up the role of Claire Redfield, then by the second will play as her brother, Chris Redfield. Both Redfields control the exact same and there are no mechanical or statistical differences between the two.During a short period of Chris's portion, players will temporarily return to the role of Claire. Supporting character Steve Burnside will also be controlled for an extremely brief time while he tests out his new dual submachine guns, though he too plays identical to Claire & Chris.InventoryAll characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots (to which can be eventually increased to ten), along with a ninth/eleventh slot that can equip a unique item. This can either be a lighter, to which is what Claire finds first, or a lockpick that she can attain later on in exchange for the lighter. If Claire receives the lockpick, Chris Redfield will then be able to receive the lighter for his part of the game. If she does not then Chris will gain the lockpick. Steve Birkin's unique item is a photograph of he and his parents.The lighter can be equipped like a weapon, though while it has no means of attack it can help illuminate the area, as well as ward away any bats. It also gives Chris access to the dual submachine guns. The lockpick can be used to unlock a number of drawers and lockers for additional supplies.All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.There are certain weapons that will take up two inventory slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:Calico Model 100 Dual PistolsDual Ingram Machine PistolsDual Golden LugersAK-47 Assault RifleM37 Sniper RifleBesides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game. Items stored in the box can be collected by each of the two characters; meaning that anything left in the item box as Claire can then be collected as Chris. However to take advantage of this feature players must plan before hand as there is no actual forewarning of when players are about to switch characters.Health & Herbs/First Aid SpraysA character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine (Green) - The character is in good health.Caution (Yellow) - The character is roughly at half health.Danger (Red) - The character is approaching death.Poison (Purple) - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.Red Herb - On its own does nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.SavingAs with Resident Evil games pre-Resident Evil 4, Code: Veronica requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.Should the player die, the game will allow them to immediately reload their latest save from the ''Death'' screen, rather than having to head back to the main menu.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersClaire RedfieldThe initial leading protagonist, Claire is roped into another zombie infested crisis after she attempts to learn more about her brother Chris Redfield's whereabouts. She is playable throughout the first half of the game where she is relegated to the role of an NPC for most of the second half.Upon surviving the destruction of Raccoon City, Claire has grown in confidence when it comes to B.O.W. threats.Voiced by Alyson Court.Chris RedfieldThe main protagonist during the second half of the game and Claire Redfield's brother. Chris was forwarded a message by Leon S. Kennedy about Claire's predicament on Rockfort Island and travels over to try and save her.By this time, only months since the destruction of Raccoon City, the S.T.A.R.S team has been disbanded. Yet despite this Chris still chose to wear a S.T.A.R.S. uniform during this excursion.Voiced by Michael Filipowich.Steve BurnsideSteve with his revised Veronica X haircutA supporting character and love-interest towards Claire Redfield. Steve is a brash, insecure teenager, and fellow prisoner on Rockfort Island. A complete show-off, Steve is always attempting to win Claire Redfield's affection with bouts of bravery, putting himself at huge risk of danger at every turn.Voiced by Bill Houston.Alfred AshfordThe first antagonist the player encounters, Alfred Ashford is in charge of the Rockfort Island base. He is an eccentric yuppie, with an ''above average'' IQ and has a fondness for using sniper rifles. He and his twin-sister Alexia's fondness for pulling the wings off of dragonflies as children makes for an early indicator to support their cold and cruel nature.Alfred also noticeably has a rather peculiar laugh that almost resembles a little girls.Voiced by Peter Oldring.Voiced by Leila Johnson during Alfred's phases were he would dress up as Alexia.Alexia AshfordThe primary antagonist and twin sister to Alfred. A certified genius, Alexia was given the duties of leading an entire team of scientists within Umbrella by the age of ten. This infamous capacity of skill garnished her a rivalry with fellow Umbrella Scientist William Birkin.Like her twin-brother, Alexia is shown to be something of megalomaniac, perhaps even more so than Alfred.Voiced by Leila Johnson.Albert WeskerDespite apparently 'dying' at the hands of his own creation--The T-002 Tyrant--during Resident Evil, Wesker returns into the fold empowered with enhanced agility and strength. His characteristic arrogance is in full effect, if it hasn't grown all the more due to his new abilities.The events of the original Resident Evil has resulted in Wesker gaining a seething hatred towards Chris Redfield in particular for thwarting his plans.Voiced by Richard Waugh.This marked the first time Richard voiced Wesker.PlotClaireThe game takes place three months after the events of RE2 and RE3. It begins with Claire Redfield raiding an Umbrella Base in Paris, after leaving Leon and Sherry to search for her brother, Chris Redfield. Claire gets caught during her raid, and she is captured and taken to Rockfort island where she meets with an inmate named Steve Burnside and they fight for their survival against the island's T-virus infected zombies. In the meantime, Albert Wesker is on a mission to recover the T-Veronica-Virus and it's his unit's fault that Rockport is now infected. Claire and Steve escape in a plane but it was set on autopilot to go to an Umbrella facility in the Antarctic, by the islands commander, Alfred Ashford. Alfred did that so he could awaken his sister from a cryogenic sleep that she was in for 15 years after she had an injection of T-Veronica-Virus. Claire and Steve defeat Alfred and escape in a digger, while Alfred limps over to his sister and experiences her awakening before dying. Alexia summons giant tentacles and grabs Steve and Claire's digger recapturing them both.ChrisThe game then flips over to Chris Redfield's perspective. After learning from Leon that his sister has been taken to Rockport he goes there and learns she has been long gone. He has an encounter with Albert Wesker and almost dies, but is saved as Alexia appears on the screen and stuns Wesker because he thought she had been dead for years. Wesker takes off to Antarctica and Chris follows. He is reunited with Claire and the two of them set out to find Steve. When they find Steve she realizes that Alexia has been experimenting on him with the T-Veronica-Virus and he has mutated into a giant reptilian monster and he tries to kill Claire. Claire runs into a prison cell but is grabbed by Alexia's tentacles, but Steve breaks through the bars and saves Claire but injures himself fatally. He reverts to human form and tells Claire that he loves her before dying.Meanwhile, Wesker and Chris fight Alexia, but Wesker was overwhelmed by her strength and he takes off. Chris manages to defeat her, but she comes back to life after Chris activates the self destruct system, releasing all the locks in the facility freeing Claire. Chris then destroys Alexia for the final time and him and Claire run to the emergency elevator where they see Wesker and his men taking Steve's body for further experiments. Claire runs to the plane, and Chris and Wesker have another showdown until they are separated by an explosion. Wesker vows to get his revenge next time they meet and then they both run to avoid dying in more explosions. The game ends with Claire and Chris escaping and Chris vowing to take down Umbrella once and for all.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Combat KnifeA standard survival knife that Claire finds in prison office where the game begins. Unlike previous Resident Evil entries, the knife can prove to be surprisingly effective (particularly when used to strike at the legs or head of a zombie) and is much more powerful. It's still not a suitable replacement for any of the firearms, though it doesn't constitute a death-wish should the player decide to test it out.Beretta M93 HandgunA 9mm handgun that Claire finds near the beginning, after she first meets Steve Burnside. It fires rather rapidly for a pistol and is reliable against most lesser enemies - zombies and Cerberus dogs in particular. It can potentially be upgraded to allow a triple burst shot, should the player find the components required. Chris can also use this handgun should the player leave it in an inventory box as Claire for Chris to collect.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Ammunition - 9mm Parabellum Rounds.Glock Model 17 HandgunA 9mm handgun that Chris Redfield brings with him when he embarks on the rescue for his sister Claire Redfield. It primarily features all of the same attributes as Claire's Beretta and can be modified also, though instead of giving a three shot burst it increases the overall power.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Ammunition - 9mm Parabellum Rounds.Colt PythonA recurring weapon within the series, the Colt Python Magnum Pistol can be attained once more in Code: Veronica. Found during Chris Redfield's segment of the story, it is immensely powerful, can kill all standard enemies with one shot, and is a solid contender against boss B.O.W's. Ammo is fairly scarce though, to make up for its well retained status as one of the most powerful firearms in the game.Maximum Ammo Count - 6 rounds.Ammunition - .357 Caliber Rounds.Bow GunMuch like her time during Resident Evil 2, Claire will have access to a bow gun. It's made to be significantly weaker than its RE2 counterpart, however, and relies solely via bug-bite attacks with its usually large containment of ammo. It can hold as many arrows at once as Claire can find, and can also stock explosive bolts if the player combines a bolt pack with explosive gun-powder.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - Bolts & Explosive Bolts.Calico Model 100 Dual PistolsDual weapons were a first for the series, introduced early on via the Calico Model 100 Dual Pistols. They were reliable against most enemies because of their power and imbued ability to aim at two simultaneous enemies. Their ammo count was ranked as a percentage and no other ammo could be found, giving them a very limited use. Because they're still technically two firearms, they take up two slots in the inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by % with each shot taking off 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Dual Ingram Machine PistolsInitially introduced during the short segment where the player controls Steve Burnside, they are primarily used throughout Chris Redfield's side of the story. They are only made available, however, should Claire give Rodrigo Juan Raval her lighter before hand. Much like the Calico Pistols, they label their ammunition via percentage and no ammo can be found once they've run out. The Ingram Pistols fire-rate is significantly faster than the Calico Pistols, and can also allow the player to aim at two different enemies simultaneously. Because they're still technically two firearms, they take up two slots in the inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by % with each shot taking off 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Dual Golden LugersThough they are seen frequently during the main story--as a puzzle item and Steve's weapons of choice before receiving the dual machine pistols--they are only used as a weapon in the Battle Game minigame when playing as Steve Burnside. They are similar to the Calico Pistols, though are much slower to fire. Like close to all firearms in the Battle Game they have infinite ammo.Maximum Ammo Count - N/A.Ammunition - N/A.M79 Grenade LauncherAlso returning from Claire's repertoire in Resident Evil 2 is the Grenade Launcher; an all-round reliable weapon, suitable for virtually any encounters - including boss battles. It features multiple grenade types, including the default grenades as well as flame, acid and gas. It can store as much ammo as possible so long as it's all the same type of grenade. Should the player switch them out for a different type of grenade, the grenades initially in the weapon will stack nicely in the characters inventory only taking up a single slot no matter how much ammo it stacks.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - Multiple variety of grenades.Spas 12 Gauge ShotgunFirst found by Chris, the Spas fills in the mandatory Shotgun slot for Code: Veronica. It carries a lot of the expected attributes, though is surprisingly weaker than most shotguns of the series and isn't as easy to fall back on for boss battles. It is nonetheless suitable against zombies at close-range and some of the larger B.O.W's such as Hunters.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 shots.Ammunition - 12 Gauge Rounds.AK-47 Assault RifleA rather unorthodox weapon for a Resident Evil game, the AK-47 is only found during Chris' segment of the story. Much like the dual wielding weapons, it's ammo count is labelled via percentage, though extra AK ammo can be procured. It is fully automatic and packs a great deal of power, proving vital against any and all enemies encountered. Because of its sturdy combination of both power and speed, it is given the handicap of requiring two inventory spaces to carry.Maximum Ammo Count - 100 bullets, marked by %, with each shot taking roughly 1%.Ammunition - 7.62x39mm Soviet Rounds.M37 Sniper RifleThe first ever sniper rifle introduced into the series, the M37 is used only once during a mid-game boss battle against the once-human Alexander Ashford, later dubbed Nosferatu. It is most often seen in the hands of Alfred Ashford as he pesters Claire throughout the first half of the game. During the one occasion it's available, it allows the player to go into a first-person view mode for better accuracy (another first for the main series, discounting Resident Evil Survivor). It only has 7 rounds, though that can be more than the player requires, should they be able to shoot Nosferatu directly in its exposed heart. This is easier said than done, however, with the icy fog surrounding the area and Nosferatu's constant expulsion of a poisonous gas.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 sniper rounds.Ammunition - N/A.Linear LauncherThe end game one-off weapon and Rocket Launcher equivalent for Code: Veronica, the Linear Launcher is a strange weapon that fires electrical homing rockets. It is only used canonically during the finale battle against the mutated blob-form of Alexia Ashford. It can be unlocked for the main game with infinite ammo should the player gain an S rank - as well as the Battle Game minigame, with the same properties, should the player gain an S rank with every character.Maximum Ammo Count - N/A.Ammunition - N/A.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]ZombiesThe walking dead are once again prevalent in Code: Veronica and share a lot of the usual properties of their other Resident Evil kin; slow, shambling movement, dangerous up close but susceptible to all weapons within the game. On occasion, zombies will vomit out acid if they can't quite reach the player.Zombie HoundAnother trademark enemy of the series, zombie dogs are always encountered in packs and contain the same agility and brutality as a standard dog. They're rather weak fortunately, and can be taken down swiftly with a few handgun or shotgun shots. Regardless, even with their rampant speed and tenacity, player-characters are still just ever-so-slightly faster and can outrun them.BandersnatcherLarge, yellow one-armed monsters, Bandersnatchers have only appeared in the Veronica games. They rely on their single long arm to stretch and attack the player, and will do so very frequently given the opportunity. They can also use their arm to latch onto walls and maneuver through the environment following the player. They're pretty sturdy as well and stand as one of the most antagonizing enemies within the game.Bandersnatchers are also only encountered on Rockfort Island during Claire's portion of the story, though Chris does face one as he searches for Claire on the island.Hunter IIWhile being very similar in appearance to the Hunter Alpha's from the original Resident Evil, these Hunter models are much more advanced and sophisticated; they can be partnered with a small surveillance robot called Seekers that'll search for its targeted prey, alerting any nearby Hunters should it locate it. They attack very much like all Hunters of the series and can still commit an instant-kill attack should the player's health be in the Caution state or lower. Hunters have formidable resistance to most weapons and are best contended with the Colt Python Magnum or AK-47 Assault Rifle - running away would be the best alternative.They are only encountered during Chris Redfield's portion of the story as they were brought in by Albert Wesker himself, who programmed them to specifically hunt down Chris.SweeperSweepers are a variant of the Hunter II model, distinguished by their reddish colour. They attack in the same patterns and can still be called upon via one of the Seeker robots. What most separates them from the standard Hunters is that their attacks can poison the player.These, too, are only encountered during Chris Redfield's portion of the story.Black WidowThese are the giant spiders of Veronica, instead opting for Black Widows over the usual tarantula arachnids. While they look significantly different from their peers, they act very similar and have the same array of attacks, with their poison-spit once again acting as their greatest weapon.CrowsAs always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They do minimal damage and can often be killed with a single bullet; their numbers are always many, however. Sometimes a shotgun blast might be worth it to take a pack down, but otherwise they're best just ignored.BatsBats function nearly the exact same as crows. The one particular difference is that they can be warded away should the player equip the lighter.MothsOnly encountered in the Antarctica base, Moths primarily function similar to crows. They constantly emit a poisonous gas, however, and can also latch onto the player leaving a maggot sack on the characters back; the player is forced to wait for the character to throw the sack off before they can leave the area. They're easy to kill, but because they often respawn once the player has leaved, it's most profitable to dash past them.Albinoid InfantThese are only encountered briefly when Claire Redfield enters a lab to collect a specific painting; they can't be killed and only act as a minor obstacle for walking through the lab. One of them will escape and will eventually become a boss battle later on.Alexia TentacleSprouting through the environment, these are tentacles spawned by the now monstrous Alexia Ashford. They will block the players path, forcing the player to shoot any that they will encounter. Fortunately they are relatively weak and don't require much ammo.[CR]Boss Battles[CR]Gulp Worm Part IWhile it isn't given much of an introduction, a giant worm titled the Gulp Worm will eventually be found burrowing outside the Military Training Facility throughout Claire Redfield's portion of the story. During this occasion it is completely optional to fight and can be largely ignored if the player is fast enough. The option to fight is still there, but would primarily be a waste of ammo since it doesn't reward anything minus its evacuation of the area, and will still be encountered later on as Chris Redfield.Gulp Worm Part IIOnce Chris Redfield arrives at Rockfort Island to save his sister Claire, unbeknownst that she's already left for Antarctica, he is ambushed by the Gulp Worm from before. After swallowing Rodrigo Juan Raval whole, Chris is forced to fight it. Its design includes a lot of surprise attacks, burrowing underground then quickly resurfacing for an attack. Sometimes it'll pop out and do a kind of roar, giving players the opportunity to attack it.While this battle is going on, the elevator that'll take Chris up to the surface is making its slow descent; it essentially acts as the timer for the boss battle, and as such if the elevator arrives before the player kills the Gulp Worm, they can opt to avoid this battle and just use the elevator. Choosing this outcome will deprive the player of the lighter Rodrigo may give, however - if Claire gave it to him before hand that is.Tyrant T-103 Part IAn alternate version of the Mr. X Tyrant model encountered during Resident Evil 2, this model is encountered twice by Claire Redfield. It differs in appearance from its coated brethren, equipped with a large, round mallet-like right fist with a large claw--as is custom with most Tyrant models-- for its left. The first time it is encountered, the player is cornered in a narrow passage with the Tyrant impeding the players progress forward, with a raging fire blocking the rear. Should the player walk into the fire, they will die instantly, forcing the player to unload everything they have into the Tyrant as it slowly makes its advance.Tyrant T-103 Part IIThe Tyrant is once again fought just as Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside are attempting to escape Rockfort Island. Somehow managing to latch onto the cargo hold, the player has to weaken the Tyrant with gunfire and then attempt to knock the Tyrant out the back with a large crate released from its safety harness. The Tyrant is otherwise invincible and cannot be killed without attempting to knock it out through the back with the crate.NosferatuOnce Alexander Ashford--the man twins Alfred and Alexia were cloned from--he was experimented on with the Veronica Virus to such an extent that he became yet another addition to the B.O.W. library. Initially seen through a grated floor, tightly strapped to a chair with a huge halberd resting on him, he eventually manages to escape and is fought on a rooftop by Claire Redfield. His main source of attack is through a constant expulsion of poisonous gas that covers a huge area of effect; up close, he has a series of sharp appendages that have sprouted out of multiple areas of his body that he can attack with. Nosferatu moves slowly, though the large cast of fog that covers the battleground can make attacking him difficult.At this point the player has access to a Sniper Rifle with 7 shots available; using the first-person view, the player can potentially kill Nosferatu with a single hit should they shoot his exposed heart well enough. Whether Claire is poisoned during this fight also factors later on in the story when Chris Redfield finds her. If she was poisoned, Chris must search for a specific antidote (blue herbs won't work) before the story can carry on.Albinoid AdultThe full grown Albinoid creature Claire encountered only hours before has now fully grown into a huge amphibious lizard-like monster. Completely surfaced under a shallow pool--literally, within a swimming pool--it is the de-facto guardian of an emblem the player needs to collect. The Albinoid will periodically discharge an aura of electricity, however, making it very dangerous to enter. The Albinoid is completely harmless otherwise, as it doesn't leave the pool. The player can opt to kill it, but if timed right can also enter the pool and collect the emblem with minimal damage.Giant Black WidowFirst seen under a sea of ice covering the main hall of the Umbrella Antarctica Base, Chris Redfield is forced to use a crane to crack the ice open to pull out the corpse of Nosferatu to claim his signet ring. This of course unleashes the Giant Black Widow. Simply massive, the Black Widow attacks much like its smaller kin but with a much larger poison spit arc.Steve BurnsideLike her father Alexander, Alexia infected Steve Burnside with the Veronica virus after she captured him and Claire. With a brief stint back as Claire during Chris' portion of the story, she finds him strapped to a chair with a large halberd resting on him exactly like Alexander. Just as Claire attempts to release him from the chair, Steve begins to mutate turning into a kind of green ogre. He equips the halberd with ease and begins to chase Claire. Steve isn't intended to be fought and the player can only run, as Steve can kill the player with just two hits, and a series of gates are being locked down through the hallway, forcing the player to stop for nothing.Alexia Ashford Humanoid FormComing off of Claire's encounter with the mutated Steve, Wesker and Alexia--now completely nude and mutated into a grey-ish color--engage in a fight with Wesker only just scraping by; noticing Chris Redfield hiding nearby, he calls it onto his ''best man'' to take care of her. Alexia herself is a relatively easy battle as they go, but her attacks can do severe damage. She will walk slowly towards the player, leeching a small line of blood which quickly bursts into flames. If the player is caught in it they have to wait through the animation of Chris attempting to wave the flames off.Alexia Ashford Sack FormShe is initially seen once again in her humanoid form as she halts Claire as she attempts to run away. If the player doesn't react, shooting Alexia with literally anything, then Alexia will kill Claire causing a game over. If the player does shoot her, she will then transform into a huge blob creature with what look like dragonfly wings, but still retaining the majority of her previous mutations face. Because of Alexia's size, the player has very little room to maneuver and only has running access on a roughly 75 degree angle. Alexia herself mostly relies on her large tentacles that'll slam down on the player. She also summons a group of small pod like creatures that plant themselves and spout out a strange tail that'll whip the player. The player can kill them, (though they prove difficult because of their size) but Alexia will eventually replace them with more. In true Resident Evil fashion, a five minute timer is ticking down during this battle.Alexia Ashford Dragonfly FormAfter Alexia Sack Form has taken enough damage, she will exit her sack and hover above the player. At the same time the Linear Launcher, which Chris and Claire prepared to power-up, is now available. Using the Linear Launcher, the player is to try and shoot down Alexia; her constant movement can make this tricky, however. Her only attack during this form is that same line of fluid she shoots out that bursts into flames. This form of Alexia isn't particularly difficult as a boss and the difficulty is built around the 5 minute timer that'll still be ticking down during this battle.[CR]Battle Game[CR]The Battle Game is a time-trial mode that is unlocked after a single completion of the main game. Here it allows the player to choose from a select few of the main cast from Veronica X to play as and make their way through a set number of rooms. The rooms themselves are all unrelated to one another and stretch across environments throughout the entire game. Each character has their own unique load-out, though they have infinite ammo for all weapons; the main goal of the mode is to primarily get a decent time, rather than try make do with limited supplies. To pass on to the next room, however, every enemy must first be killed.Initially, only Claire and Chris are available, though if the player finds the broken Golden Luger pistol during the main game, Steve Burnside will be unlocked from the outset. He can otherwise still be unlocked if the player completes the mode as Claire. Albert Wesker also makes his playable debut for the Battle Game, and is unlocked via a completion with Chris in the mode. The final character is an alternate costume of Claire that is also unlocked after a single completion as default Claire in the Battle Game. Claire's alternate costume is exclusive for the Battle Game mode, however, and cannot be worn through the main game. Should the player get an S ranking for all characters, they unlock a Linear Launcher with infinite ammo (the Linear Launcher is also unlockable with infinite ammo for the main-game if the player scores an S ranking).Albert Wesker's Epilogue screenWhat is unique about the Battle Game is that introduces the option to play in a first person view. The controls are still the same, though, and players still cannot shoot and move either, arguably making the FP mode more of an intriguing gimmick than a substantial alternative.[CR]Xbox 360, PS3 Version[CR]On March 23 2011, Capcom announced that Resident Evil 4 HD and Code: Veronica X HD would be coming to XBLA and PSN as two separate downloads in the Summer of the same year. This is of course in contrast to the compilation disc, entitled \"Resident Evil Revival Selection\" which received a Japanese-only release sometime before the fall. As the title suggests, it features enhanced 720p HD resolutions, as well as a full 1000 points Achievement score across 12 achievements, and 12 trophies for the PS3. No Platinum Trophy, however.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Disc 1Resident Evil: Code Veronica Original Soundtrack (Japanese cover art.)The MovieTitle CallingPrologueOpening - Claire VersionThrown Into DespairOnce AgainFirst ContactDeath SiegeSteve's ChafeIncomingPutrid SmellThe Palace of InsaneA Moment of ReliefInfantsHot RescueThrough the ScopePiano RollGreetingsInductionOther side of GlassGetting OutTarget LockedPulsating Right ArmHere Comes the KnightEntrapmentCuriosityFatherLachrymalThe Suspended DollOne-man ShowAshford's Music BoxPandora's BoxThe Secret DoorNot AlexiaA State of EmergencyIt's Back!The Theme of Tyrant 3- Version AAs You WishRevenge!The Theme of Tyrant 3- Version BMidnight SunCrash!BlancThe Confined ITYou Think You're Safe NowResonance of BloodGo With the DiggerThe Theme of NosferatuThe Ending of the BeginningDisc 2The Opening- Chris VersionI Need To KnowR.I.P.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Resident Evil 2 (or Biohazard 2 in Japan) is a survival horror game that was originally released in 1998 by Capcom. Resident Evil 2 primarily utilizes the same mechanics and gameplay styles as the previous Resident Evil, but with updated graphics and a new story set only three months after the original.On August 12th, 2015, a remake of Resident Evil 2 was finally announced after years of high demand from fans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] & ControlsClaire aiming up towards an attacking LickerThe gameplay of Resident Evil 2 is virtually the same as the gameplay of the first one, and features a mix of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving. Players move via a series of pre-determined camera angles and control their character with 'tank controls', much like most survival horror games of the era. Combat as such is rather rudimentary, as players simply aim their weapon with R1 and shoot with X (default PS1 controls). They can aim up or down this way as well, though with the assistance of auto-aim (which can be turned off) combat is a relatively simple affair. To make up for it, however, ammunition is scarce, and thusly forces players to choose between whether it's worth engaging in combat or attempting to flee.The story is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.Difficulty SettingsThere are two difficulty settings available across most ports of Resident Evil 2 -- Rookie and Normal. Normal plays much like how the game was intended, whereas Rookie lessens enemy health and gifts players some additional handgun ammunition and first aid sprays in the item box.The PC version features a Hard difficulty setting, which increases enemy health and damage. The N64 version also has available an Arranged mode that mixes all of the items in the game around, similar to the mode found in Resident Evil: Director's Cut.Playable CharactersLike the original Resident Evil, there are two playable characters to choose from -- Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, sister of Chris Redfield. However unlike the original, the two characters do in fact coincide and have varying storylines from one another, whereas both Chris & Jill's were essentially the same minus a few details.Mechanically-speaking the two characters are now practically identical to one another. They both can withstand the same degree of damage and have the same maximum inventory slots. The story itself dictates the differences, as it'll take each in slightly different directions of the Raccoon Police Department, and they each feature their own set of unique puzzles to solve, weapons to collect, and characters to meet.Ada Wong, supporting character amidst Leon's storyLeon's story will bring him into contact with femme-fatale, Ada Wong. Claiming to be a civilian on the search for her boyfriend, she will provide assistance to Leon throughout the game. On two occasions she will follow as an invincible AI companion for a short time, armed with a HP browning pistol. Alongside being invincible, she has infinite ammo (though must at least reload when necessary) and will help kill any enemies the two encounter through their travels.Beyond those sequences, players will also be forced to take control of Ada on two occasions for story purposes. She controls exactly like Leon and Claire, and has available her HP Browning pistol and a single first aid spray. However her weapon stance is different from both characters, and it gives her an increase in firing rate with her pistol.Claire too has a playable supporting character, however her's is the twelve year old Sherry Birkin. Like Ada, she too will function both as a friendly NPC and as a playable character. However because she is only twelve, she has no means of attack available. When following as an NPC, players cannot run off too far otherwise Sherry will crouch down and cower, awaiting Claire's return. When standing still Sherry and Claire will hold hands, though they will let go once Claire starts moving again.Sherry Birkin, a lost twelve year old girlAs a playable character she once again has no means of attack (she does at least have a first aid spray) and must attempt to avoid enemies. Though because of her small stature, zombies at least will not be able to bite her and will only attempt to vomit acid on her instead, which does considerably less damage. As well as having no means of attack, Sherry has a slower running speed than all the other characters in the game.For the PS1 version their stories are restricted to their own disc--one for Leon, one for Claire--however most physical ports since then have compiled them onto one.The A and B ScenariosClaire & Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Leon A / Claire BResident Evil 2 featured four different scenarios; the first two were labelled as Leon A and Claire B scenarios, where Leon entered the police station through the front entrance and Claire through the back door. The second two scenarios, labelled as Claire A and Leon B, had the roles reversed with the plotline slightly altered. Each scenario provided a different experience such as meeting with Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh on Scenario A, and being stalked by the T-103 'Mr. X' Tyrant during Scenario B.Players first only have access to Leon & Claire's A Scenario, though upon completing either will then be asked to create a new save slot for the alternate character's B Scenario.There are a handful of player choices that can carry over from A Scenario to B. As either character, they will eventually stumble upon a minipack and submachine gun. The A Scenario character can choose to take it with them, or they could instead leave it for the B Scenario character to collect instead. There is also a room located within the Umbrella Lab near the end of the game that requires two hand print IDs to open. As such, it can only be opened once both Scenario characters have registered their hand print and then placed their hand on the scanner, allowing the B Scenario character to its contents.They are the two most notable crossovers, though there are smaller effects as well, such as leaving the zombified Marvin Branagh alive in Scenario A, which will then have him continue to persist in the alternate character's B Scenario.Claire & Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Claire A / Leon BSince Resident Evil 2 featured several different combinations of events and endings, it was for a time left ambiguous as to which ordering was the true version. However it was eventually confirmed by Capcom via the official Resident Evil timeline in Resident Evil 5 that the canon order is the Claire A & Leon B telling.During Claire's B Scenario, there is only one segment of the game where players must control Sherry, as opposed to two in the A Scenario.InventoryInventory screen, with the character's health up top.All characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots, though each character also has a unique item in a static ninth slot. Leon at first has a lighter, which must otherwise be acquired within the RPD as Claire, and Claire has a lockpick. Though unlike Jill's capabilities in Resident Evil, Claire can only use it to open up locked drawers to acquire some additional supplies. Leon must instead locate small keys to open the drawers. Leon will also eventually replace his lighter with a G-Virus vial, though it is only carried for narrative purposes, serves no mechanical use, and is only temporary at that before he throws it away and finds himself with his lighter again.Supporting characters Ada & Sherry each only have a photograph; Ada's is of her and her boyfriend John, while Sherry's is of her and her parents, William and Annette Birkin. The photographs serve no mechanical use, however.There are certain weapons that will take up 2 slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:Submachine gunFlamethrowerSpark ShotGatling GunRocket LauncherBesides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.Health & Herbs/First Aid SpraysA character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine (Green) - The character is in good health.Caution (Yellow) - The character is roughly at half health.Danger (Red) - The character is approaching death.Poison (Purple) - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.Red Herb - On its own does nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.SavingLike the original, Resident Evil 2 requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersLeon S. KennedyOne of two protagonists, Leon is a rookie cop who managed to avoid the massacre of the Raccoon City police force--as first detailed in Resident Evil 3--via serendipity after sleeping in on the day he was supposed to show. Despite his lack of experience as a police officer--with this literally being his first day on the job--Leon is a surprisingly capable individual, and has underwent weapons training for a number of firearms at the academy crediting to his variable weapons skills.While he can be aptly described as 'wet behind the ears' and even a little naive, Leon is still a good-natured soul, and will try with all of his might to assist any fellow survivors in any way he can.Voiced by Paul Haddad.Claire RedfieldNineteen year old sister to S.T.A.R.S. officer Chris Redfield and fellow protagonist to Leon, Claire is wrapped up into the Raccoon City nightmare by unfortunate happenstance. Arriving by motorbike in her attempts to find Chris, who unbeknownst to her had left for Europe to investigate the Umbrella Corp., she must quickly adapt to the horror and use all of her instincts to survive.Being something of a tomboy, Claire had spent many a time practicing with firearms at a firing range, and has also been tutored by Chris himself. Claire is as such strongly independent and resourceful, and will also have to exercise her sisterly instincts whence she comes into contact with twelve year old Sherry Birkin.Voiced by Alyson Court.Ada WongA mysterious young woman whom Leon eventually encounters amidst his search of the Raccoon Police Precinct, she claims she is but a lost civilian that is trying to locate her boyfriend, John. The aura of mystery that surrounds her, however, hints at an ulterior motive.Exceptionally capable and a fine marksman with a pistol, Ada quickly proves to be a valuable ally throughout the game, regardless of what her true intentions may be.Voiced by Sally Cahill.Sherry BirkinA lost twelve year old girl, Sherry has managed to evade danger and get around via the air vents. However she is eventually cornered by Claire, who takes it upon herself to try and protect her. The daughter of Umbrella scientists William & Annette Birkin, she is completely unaware of their involvement with the Raccoon City disaster.Before the outbreak Sherry was rarely given any attention from her parents, whom were always far too enveloped in their work. As such, Sherry is shy and finds it difficult to open up to people.Voiced by Lisa Yamanaka.Ben BertolucciA journalist and contact of Ada Wong, Ben has willingly locked himself up in a Police Department jail cell in the hopes that it'll better provide safety against the zombies and other monsters that have plagued the station.Ben was originally working on uncovering corruption within the R.P.D., and as such is weary and standoffish towards police officers.Voiced by Rod Wilson.Brian IronsThe Chief of Police for the Raccoon Police Department, Brian at first presents himself as someone merely trying to survive and make sense of the horror that has engulfed the city. However it is soon revealed that he is not only something of a sadist, but is in fact receiving bribes from the Umbrella Corporation.His closing of the case surrounding the Mansion Incident from Resident Evil--while refuting any accusations towards Umbrella's involvement--is what lead to the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members to disband and investigate on their own.Voiced by Gary Krawford.Annette BirkinAn Umbrella scientist, mother of Sherry Birkin and wife to William Birkin, Annette is riddled with grief over the Raccoon City disaster. In part because of what has happened to William, but also as she frantically tries to locate Sherry for reasons that aren't entirely the instincts of a loving mother.On the surface she seems like any sympathetic mother trying to find her daughter, but her paranoia concerning the enigmatic G-Virus, and her devotion to William, slowly begins to consume her.Voiced by Jennifer Dale.William BirkinOne of Umbrella's top researchers and the creator of the G-Virus, William is soon betrayed by Umbrella, and in a desperate act to survive an attack by their agents he injects himself with his own creation. As such, William has become something other than human, and will continually come into conflict with Leon and Claire throughout the game.Voiced by Diego Matamores.  PremiseLeon & ClaireResident Evil 2 follows the story of rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield during the zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. On his first day on the job, Leon finds a dead body on the road as he enters the city and leaves his car to investigate. Claire Redfield, sister to leading hero from the original Resident Evil Chris Redfield, also arrives in the city at the same time by motorbike in her attempts to find her brother.The two are soon enveloped by an onslaught of zombies; Leon is ambushed by zombies on the Raccoon City streets, whereas Claire encounters the undead while exploring a deserted diner. The two soon meet up with one another and commandeer an abandoned police car; Claire then collects the Browning HP pistol from the cruiser's glovebox. They begin driving through the city only to be caught in an accident due to a zombie hiding in the car's backseat, while also colliding with a truck that's being driven by a man in the midst of turning into a zombie. The accident forces Leon and Claire to split up and decide to rendezvous at the police station.PlotNote: This plot description specifically details the canon Claire A / Leon B sequence of the story.Claire RedfieldRobert Kendo's gruesome demiseUpon escaping the wreckage, Claire takes shelter in a nearby gun store from the encroaching horde of zombies. There she meets the owner Robert Kendo, who offers his store to act as a safe haven. However it isn't long before zombies smash through the window and devour Kendo.Claire is once again able to escape and eventually reaches the Raccoon Police Department. There she encounters a mortally wounded police officer, Marvin Branagh, who hands her a keycard to unlock the doors. Marvin also briefs Claire about the events of the original Resident Evil, while also stating how the surviving STARS officers--including her brother--have disappeared. Claire attempts to assist Marvin, however he instead forces her to leave the room at gunpoint and then locks the door once she leaves.With the keycard in hand, Claire is able to unlock the main hall doors and begin her exploration of the precinct. Upon the STARS office, she finds Chris' diary, detailing his leaving of the city to head to Europe to further investigate the Umbrella Corporation. When exiting the office, she encounters a small girl; the girl then reactively runs away out of fear. Claire gives chase but loses her, though is also then reunited with Leon in the nearby corridor, who hands her a radio so they can better keep in touch. While disheartened by the discovery that Chris isn't in Raccoon City, Leon states that they both need to scour for survivors and then ultimately escape the city. Claire agrees, and the two part ways.Determined to find the little girl, Claire continues her search. She is eventually able to access Chief of Police Brian Irons' office, where he himself still resides. On his table is the corpse of the mayor's daughter; Brian admits that he killed her, but only because she was turning into a zombie. Brian then asks that he be left alone.Chief of Police, Brian IronsClaire decides to explore the backroom that leads out of Irons' office. Inside is the little girl, who Claire finally manages to corner. Claire reassures her that she's not a zombie and merely wants to help. The little girl says her name is Sherry. After the brief introduction, Sherry states that she is looking for her parents and that there's more than just zombies roaming throughout the station. A load roar can be heard, which startles Sherry and forces her to run away again. Claire then heads back to Irons' office, only to find both he and the corpse gone. His diary is left on his desk chair; reading it reveals Irons' sordid activities involving hunting and trapping other police officers, as well as his involvement with the Umbrella Corporation. Behind his desk is a strange puzzle requiring three square stones to be placed.Heading deeper into the station, Claire investigates the station's underground. There she again encounters Sherry, who thinks she heard her father calling for her. Crawling through a small opening in a fence, Sherry once again goes off on her own against Claire's wishes. While exploring the area, she locates some supplies for Claire, but again decides to go off on her own in search of her father.After locating all three stone pieces, Claire returns to Brian Irons' office. There she is reunited with Sherry, who Claire pleads that she stay close. After setting the stones, it unlocks a secret passage in the wall; Claire tells Sherry to wait in the office while she climbs down the ladder. Claire is then held at gunpoint by Irons', who explains his frustration that Umbrella have destroyed his ''beautiful town'' and his involvement with the company. He also lets loose that the creator of the G-Virus, William Birkin, is the father of Sherry. Noticing that he's at his rope's end and believes he's going to die, he decides that he's going to take Claire with him.Claire rescuing Sherry from the garbage disposal dumpHowever before he can act, Brian begins to convulse with pain as his chest is torn apart by a parasitic larvae. Heading down the ladder leading towards the sewers, the larvae then begins to grow into a large, humanoid monster. Claire is able to best the creature and it ultimately disintegrates. Returning to Sherry, the two continue through the sewers; Claire also radios Leon that Brian Irons' office is accessible, and thet she's heading to the sewers with Sherry. However Sherry is once again forced to split-up with Claire as she accidentally falls down a drainage gate. On her own, Sherry explores throughout the sewers, but falls down into a large garbage pile and falls unconscience as she limply calls for Claire. A large, monstrous creature then appears and infects Sherry with a parasitic larvae.Amidst Claire's search for Sherry, she encounters her mother, Annette Birkin. While holding Claire at gunpoint, Annette explains Umbrella's betrayal of she and her husband William Birkin, and how William injected himself with his own G-Virus after an attack on his life by Umbrella Security Service agents. The G-Virus turned him into a monster as he soon slaughtered the U.S.S. agents, minus one -- HUNK. This attack let loose many T-Virus vials, which were feasted on by rats. This then set into motion the T-Virus infection of Raccoon City.After Annette claims that William is likely searching for their daughter Sherry, the two split-up to find her first. Claire manages to locate Sherry unconscience on the garbage pile, however she must first fight her way past a giant alligator. Once that's done, she helps Sherry up, both of whom are unaware of Sherry's larvae infection.The two continue onward, finally managing to escape out of the sewers and coming upon a hidden Umbrella factory. There the two board a stationary tram as it heads downwards, taking the two to an Umbrella Laboratory. However as the tram descends, Sherry starts to feel sick and passes out. Furthermore, a large claw strikes through the tram only just missing Sherry. Claire leaves Sherry in the tram while she investigates outside.Upon investigating the tram platform, the monstrous William Birkin jumps from atop the tram after further mutating. Claire does battle with the monster and is able to force him to collapse and bleed out. The tram then arrives at its destination; from there Claire takes Sherry to the receptionist office of the lab. Giving Sherry her biker jacket ''for protection'', Claire leaves Sherry in the office while she goes on to explore the lab.Claire handing over her jacket to SherryClaire eventually bumps into Annette Birkin once more, who proclaims that Sherry may have been infected by William in his attempt to create offspring. However William himself ambushes Annette; Annette, who has been slowly driven insane, tries to embrace what used to be her husband, but is viciously murdered by him. Claire is able to locate a file detailing the creation of the cure Sherry needs. Entering William's own lab, she is able to create the cure to eliminate the infection. With the cure in hand, the self-destruct mechanism also goes into motion. Unlocking all doors, this also opens up the emergency exit. After radioing Leon to bring Sherry to the emergency exit, Claire goes on the move to meet them.After locating the elevator that'll take her down to the escape train, William Birkin bursts through the wall above and mutates even further. Now taking the form of a kind of huge canine creature, it attacks Claire. With a five minute timer ticking down, Claire is once again able to defend herself against Birkin. As it begins to decompose, Claire boards the elevator. The train has already begun to move, with Leon shouting for Claire to jump on. She does so and administers the cure to Sherry; it works, providing relief for both Claire and Leon.Leon S. KennedyLeon exploring the police precinctAfter escaping the wreckage, Leon finds himself much closer to the police station than Claire and enters via the back. Upon entering the station, however, a helicopter can be seen trying to rescue a police officer. However zombies arrive and begin to feast on the officer, all the while he erratically begins to fire his submachine gun, killing the pilot and forcing him to crash.Making his way past the destruction and entering the station, another helicopter soon arrives, but instead drops a large container containing the Umbrella created Tyrant T-103. It slowly begins to walk towards Leon and attacks him, forcing Leon to kill it.Amidst his exploration, he encounters a small girl who quickly runs away. He gives chase, but she escapes via a small hole in the wall. Heading back down to the corridor he is reunited with Claire. Leon hands her a radio so they can keep in contact, while stating that they must search for fellow survivors and escape the city. Claire agrees, and the two split-up once more.Heading down to the station's car lot Leon is shot at by a woman, though she misses. She apologises after mistaking him for a zombie and introduces herself as Ada Wong. She is searching for her boyfriend John. Leon offers to help, and the two are then able to push a parked truck out of the way so as to gain access to the station's jail quarters.From there they meet Ben Bertolucci, a journalist who was investigating corruption within the RPD and is a contact of Ada's. He has purposely locked himself in a jail cell to help provide protection from the zombies and other monsters roaming the station. In a bid to help them escape the city, he suggests that their best bet would be the sewers. Ada then rushes off on her own.Ada & Leon meeting Ben BertolucciLeon attempts to catch up to Ada via the sewers and suggests they work together. Noticing a crawlspace up top, Ada asks Leon to give her a boost to investigate. He complies, and allows Ada to go off on her own. Upon entering through the crawlspace she encounters a small girl. The surprise forces the girl to drop her pendant and run away. Ada collects the pendant, and upon opening it up notices a small vial containing a purple substance.Ada locates some supplies to which she throws through the crawlspace to Leon, but then opts to head off on her own as she can't reach the crawlspace from her end. Nearby is a door that leads further into the sewers, only it's locked with a strange chess piece puzzle mechanism. Leon explores the station for the pieces required, though throughout his travels he is continually hounded by the T-103 tyrant. Leon is able to successfully defend himself each time, though it still continues to show up despite the damage it is dealt.Upon returning to the underground Leon hears Ben scream in terror. Arriving to his aid, he notices Ben bloodied and battered. Ben gives Leon evidence incriminating Chief Brian Irons' involvement with the Umbrella Corporation, and the corporation's nefarious schemes. Ben shortly dies from his injuries.Returning to the locked chess piece door, Leon encounters what looks to be a man. The man then begins to mutate and grow a large eye into his right arm. He then pulls off a pipe and begins to slowly advance towards Leon. Leon is able to do enough damage to the monster to force it to fall over the edge into the sewers below.Unlocking the door and entering the sewers himself, Leon again encounters Ada. He scolds her for running away and asks that they stick together. Ada complies, stating she'll ''do things your way, for now''. The two continue through the sewers, however after heading down an elevator Ada notices a female scientist. She chases after her but the scientist begins firing; Leon then quickly dives in front of Ada, while being shot in the process. He falls unconscience while the scientist runs away. Ada then gives chase.Finally managing to catch up to her, the scientist shoots Ada's weapon out of her hand and identifies herself as Annette Birkin. She tells of Umbrella's betrayal of she and her husband William Birkin, and how William injected himself with his own G-Virus after an attack on his life by Umbrella Security Service agents. The G-Virus turned him into a monster as he soon slaughtered the U.S.S. agents, minus one -- HUNK. This attack let loose many T-Virus vials, which were feasted on by rats. This then set into motion the T-Virus infection of Raccoon City.The T-103 Tyrant advancing unto LeonAfter discovering that the woman she is talking to is Ada Wong, she coldly states that her boyfriend John is dead and became a zombie. Being aware of her true intentions, Annette then attempts to kill Ada; the two engage in a struggle, with Ada slapping Annette forcing her to fall over the edge of the railing. Ada attempts to grab her hand, but to no avail and sarcastically responds with ''too bad''.Leon manages to wake up and goes after Ada despite his injuries. Finding her nearby to where she fought with Annette, she thanks Leon for his bravery in saving her from being shot and patches up his bullet wound. She also shares with him her discovery of John's fate, and asks that they get out of here.The two continue through the sewers until locating a tram, which takes them toward an abandoned Umbrella factory. There they encounter another tram, only this one stays motionless on a platform that descends down to Umbrella' secret laboratory. However as it descends, William Birkin attacks the two. He first strikes through the tram's wall, managing to graze Ada and knocking her out. Leon then heads outside and does battle with William and is once more able to defeat him.Returning to the tram Ada has awoken, although the tram has stopped midway and hasn't managed to reach the lab. Leon suggests that Ada should stay and rest while he looks for a way to kickstart the tram. After climbing through the vents, however, the tram inconveniently begins to work and continues its descent with Ada still inside. With no other alternative but to make his way down, Leon is able to restore power to the area and the nearby elevator, and use it to reach the lab. Noticing the tram, Leon enters but finds that Ada has disappeared.Leon will eventually come into contact with Annette Birkin, who while holding him at gunpoint states that Ada is in fact a spy and is trying to acquire the G-Virus. Leon doesn't believe her, though Annette doesn't seem to care either way as she then prepares to kill him. Just before she pulls the trigger, the T-103 tyrant arrives on the scene, forcing Annette to run away. Leon is able to once again deal enough damage to temporarily down the creature, and tries to find Ada.Ada & Leon's embraceHeading towards the power room, Leon is again ambushed by the T-103 tyrant. Only this time Ada arrives for assistance and tries to gain its attention to save Leon. The tyrant does so and grabs her; Ada manages to shoot it in the face, however, forcing it to toss Ada away at a large machine console before it accidentally falls into a vat of molten liquid below.The collision between Ada and the machine dealt enough damage that it instigated the self-destruct sequence. Leon rushes to Ada, who appears to be dying, and the two share an intimate kiss before she bleeds out.Leon soon receives a radio call from Claire, asking him to retrieve Sherry from the receptionist office. He does so, and takes the elevator down to the emergency escape train, which has become accessible due to the self-destruct sequence. He lets Sherry rest on the tram and then heads back out to turn on the power. Upon doing so, however, the T-103 tyrant arrives, having gone through a severe mutation that has given it two large claws and made to be much more aggressive. The battle occurs in the midst of a five minute timer, with Leon just barely able to defend himself until a silhouette of what looks to be Ada drops him a rocket launcher.Leon picks up the rocket launcher and fires it at the tyrant, destroying it completely. Making his return to the train now that it is powered, he turns on the train. As it begins to pick up speed, Claire arrives and jumps onto the train just in the nick of time. She quickly administers a cure for Sherry, who was infected by William, which appears to take effect and heal her. With the ordeal behind them, Leon heads to the driver's compartment and says his goodbye to Ada.However the train quickly rumbles as an alarm sounds. Leon heads back to Claire and Sherry asking what's going on, and heads to investigate the other compartments. Reaching the very end of the train, William Birkin--now an amorphous blob--pours onto the train and slowly slithers towards Leon. With the door locked behind him as a precautionary measure put into effect by the train, Leon is forced to unload everything he has into the monster. After enough punishment it begins to disintegrate, as the door also conveniently unlocks behind Leon.William Birkin's final formWhile on his way to return to Claire, William Birkin strikes back into action, forcing all three characters to split-up. Claire is left hanging off the bottom of the train, Leon crawls across the top, and Sherry rushes to the driver's compartment. Leon is then able to reach the driver's compartment and tell Sherry to turn on the emergency brake. She does so, allowing the three to reunite and quickly run out of the tunnel before the train self-destructs.With the nightmare finally over with, the three rest their weary legs. But only before Claire rises up again and states that she still has to find her brother Chris.EpilogueAs first detailed in Claire's unlockable epilogue file in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Leon opposes Claire's idea to quickly rush into action so soon to find her brother. Insulted that she opts to abandon them for the sake of her brother, Leon tells her to go and that they [Leon & Sherry] don't need her help. Claire understands that they require medical attention, yet sets out anyway, while promising that she'll return one day.Alternate ScenariosWhile Claire A & Leon B is the canon ordering, players can still alternatively play through the opposite sequence, where Leon in fact heads through the entrance and Claire enters from the back. This then switched certain character roles, such as Claire coming into conflict with the T-103 Tyrant, and Leon encountering the characters of Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh. Though the results are the same, there are certain character fates that differ slightly during this ordering of the Scenarios:Leon ALeon upon first entering the Raccoon Police Station during his A Scenario Leon first reunites with Claire in the STARS office.Ben Bertolucci dies by being infected with a parasitic larvae that bursts out of his chest.Leon will alert Claire that the underground carpark and jail department is now accessible.Ada is left to rest in the receptionist office much like Sherry was.After learning of her true nature, Ada Wong holds Leon at gunpoint and demands he hand over the G-Virus vial he collected from Annette. However after letting down her guard after a short talk, she is then shot in the chest by Annette and ultimately falls over the edge of the walkway.Annette then passes out due to her injuries from a couple of pipes landing on her head after the self-destruct mechanism was initiated.Claire BClaire first reunites with Leon in the STARS office.Brian Irons dies by being pulled down a ladder by William and then torn in half.While Sherry still accidentally falls through the sewer grate, she isn't infected with the parasitic larvae and reunites with Claire at the factory tram.Claire first meets Annette as she clambers out of the sewers, barely able to talk, and then passes out. She is thusly not able to detail the origins of the T-Virus outbreak in the city and William Birkin's transformation.Sherry is left in the descending tram much like Ada was.Claire notices Sherry cornered by the T-103 tyrant on a CCTV monitor. Annette also arrives and states that Sherry's pendant houses a G-Virus vial, which is what the tyrant is after.After rescuing Sherry from the tyrant, they then encounter Annette lying on the floor, badly wounded after the pipes landed on her head. She apologises to Sherry for not being a good mother, and then dies from her injuries.At the very end, Leon will instead get up and state that it's up to them to take down Umbrella.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Combat KnifeA starting weapon for both Leon & Claire, the knife is traditionally a last resort tactic and even then the player should probably choose to run away instead. It does minimal damage, has a short reach of attack, and the player may often accidentally have it collide with the scenery leaving the player vulnerable for a second.Leon & Claire each use the knife differently, with Leon choosing to jab it as opposed to Claire's swipe -- which may have been taught to her by Chris given that it's a similar method as to how he used his.H&K VP70Leon's starting handgun, the H&K is a reliable enough pistol, though because of its slow rate of fire and lack of stopping power, it's best restricted for lesser enemies such as zombies and zombie dogs. It may be useful for conserving ammo for better weaponry when there's enough distance, but it's otherwise still not very reliable against the larger enemies of the game.Maximum Ammo Count - 18 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.H&K VP70 BurstAn upgraded version of Leon's handgun that now offers the choice between single shot or a three-shot burst fire. While it has no increase in overall power, the burst fire gives it a boost in stopping power and damage output, however because of its faster rate of fire ammo may begin to dwindle quicker than expected. The items required to upgrade it are located within a locked drawer that requires a generic small key to open.Maximum Ammo Count - 18 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.Browning HPClaire Redfield's starting handgun that she collects from the glove box of a police cruiser. It is slightly stronger in power to Leon's H&K, though it can only hold 13 bullets at a time. Its stopping power is also still very low so it is again best restricted for the lesser enemies of the game. Unlike Leon's, Claire's cannot be upgraded.Ada Wong is also shown to be equipped with this pistol, only she has a slightly different firing stance than Claire and is able to fire it more effectively with a faster rate of fire.Maximum Ammo Count - 13 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.Colt Single Action ArmyAn unlockable weapon exclusive to Claire, the Colt S.A.A. has six shots and is fired from the hip. It has an extremely high rate of fire and more stopping power than any other handgun in the game. Though because of its rate of fire, ammo may begin to dwindle quicker as a result, as will reloads be more necessary -- players can still choose to reload via their inventory menu, however.Maximum Ammo Count - 6 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.S.T.A.R.S. Beretta 92FS CustomThe best pistol in the game, this weapon is exclusive to Chris Redfield in the Extreme Battle minigame (see below to Unlockables). Because of Chris' expertise with handguns, it has a faster rate of fire than other handguns (though it isn't faster than the Colt) and has a high chance to score a critical hit against zombies and pop their head akin to a magnum.Maximum Ammo Count - 15 rounds.Standard Ammunition - 9mm bullets.Remington ShotgunA shotgun exclusive to Leon, and what'll likely be a solid contender for boss battles for most players across the game. As is custom with video game shotguns the remington is very powerful at close-range, but has a slow rate of fire and its damage output decreases the further away an enemy is.It can be used to completely destroy a zombie's head or legs whence a player aims up or down respectively if one is close enough. There is also the chance that a zombie's torso will fall off after being shot and will then proceed to crawl towards the player. Players will commonly first encounter the shotgun at the very beginning of A Scenario, though there is another one located in the locker of the S.T.A.R.S. office. This is so players can still collect a shotgun whilst also attempting to trigger the Brad Vickers zombie (see below at Unlockables).Maximum Ammo Count - 5 rounds.Ammunition - 12 gauge shells.Remington Shotgun (Upgraded)Later in the game the player will come upon ''shotgun parts'', that when combined with the basic remington will upgrade it with a stock and longer barrel. This will increase the weapon's power significantly and allow it to hold more rounds, however the recoil is also drastically increased.Maximum Ammo Count - 7 rounds.Ammunition - 12 gauge shells.BowgunA crossbow misnamed due to a localization era as a 'bowgun', this is essentially the shotgun equivalent for Claire Redfield. It functions similarly as it shoots out three bolts at once and does a fair amount of damage. However unlike the shotgun the bowgun is powerful at any range so long as the bolts hit, but the overall damage isn't as high. It has a decent amount of stopping power and can push back certain enemies the amount of force is so high. Some enemies such as crows can even get stuck to a wall by a bolt when shot.Like Leon's shotgun, the bowgun will often be first encountered during the beginning of A Scenario, though there exists another in the S.T.A.R.S. office locker.Maximum Ammo Count - 18 bolts.Ammunition - Bolts.Grenade LauncherBesides secret weapons, the grenade launcher is Claire's most powerful firearm and is a popular weapon to use against boss monsters. Much like the bazooka from the original, there are multiple grenade types available: grenade, fire, and acid. Grenade is the stock ammunition and deals heavy explosive damage; fire does less damage overall but is especially powerful against certain enemies like plants; and acid also does less base damage but has the benefit of a splash radius and deals continuous damage over time.One convenient quirk is the weapon's ability to carry as much ammo as possible, so long as it's one grenade type. When changing grenade types the specific grenade type will also stack together and will only take up one space regardless of how much ammo it carries.Maximum Ammo Count - N/AAmmunition - Grenade, Fire, and Acid rounds.Desert Eagle MagnumAn incredibly powerful magnum-pistol that is exclusive to Leon. Besides secret weapons, this is undoubtedly Leon's most effective weapon amongst his arsenal. It is suitable for most enemies and bosses across the game, and will notably destroy a zombie's head completely whence shot with it.Maximum Ammo Count - 8 rounds.Ammunition - 50. caliber rounds.Desert Eagle Magnum (Upgraded)Much like the shotgun, the player can find magnum parts that once combined with the magnum will increase the weapon's barrel significantly. It now does even more damage, but it also now suffers from a significant increase in recoil.Maximum Ammo Count - 8 rounds.Ammunition - 50. caliber rounds.Submachine GunA fully-automatic firearm, the submachine gun is effective at keeping enemies stunlocked, though the actual damage output isn't especially high. There are two submachine guns across the game, though there is no additional ammo to collect for either. The first is encountered in a weapon's locker during Scenario A; the player could take it then and there, or leave it for the alternate character to collect during Scenario B.The second is located in an Umbrella Lab. To access it, however, requires each character of Scenarios A & B to register their handprint, and then place their hand on the door's scanner. It as such is only accessible for the Scenario B character to collect. This weapon takes up two slots within a character's inventory.Maximum Ammo Count - 100%, with roughly 3 bullets counting as 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Spark ShotA weapon exclusive to Claire, the Spark Shot is an unorthodox weapon that fires electrical charges. Like the submachine gun it requires two free slots to carry and its ammunition is represented with a percentage -- no additional ammo can be found. Its effectiveness isn't especially great, however, though it may prove useful against crowds due to the charge passing through all within close vicinity.Maximum Ammo Count - 100%, with each charge representing 2%.Ammunition - N/A.FlamethrowerA weapon of limited use, the flamethrower is exclusive to Leon and takes up two inventory slots. Its ammo is also represented by percentage. Its primary use is against the mutant plants the player will encounter amidst the Umbrella Lab, as they are extremely resistant against most other forms of damage. However beyond that it is weak and deals little damage -- its fuel also rapidly runs out, and like other two slot weapons has no additional ammo to spare.Maximum Ammo Count - 100%, with each second of flame output representing 1%.Ammunition - N/A.Gatling GunA secret weapon that is only used by unlocking it with infinite ammo. It requires players to complete each set of a Scenario A & B with at least an A rank, and will then reside within the Scenario A's item box as well the Scenario B's whence Scenario A has been completed again. Though while it has a bit of a build up, it can rip through everything with enough time.Maximum Ammo Count - Infinite.Ammunition - N/A.Rocket LauncherWithin a narrative-context the rocket launcher is used to destroy the mutated T-103 tyrant during Scenario B, though like the gatling gun can be unlocked with infinite ammo under the same requirements. It can kill nearly every enemy and boss in the game besides William Birkin in his canine form and his shapeless blob form.Maximum Ammo Count - 2Ammunition - N/A[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]ZombiesLike the original, zombies function as the most common enemy encountered throughout Resident Evil 2. Though they have a more varied set of animations, and there is a greater variety of models now too -- which includes the series' debut of female zombies.Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick. Zombies also have a slight chance of splitting in two after being shot with a shotgun. Their torso will collapse onto the ground and will then proceed to crawl towards the player, though if the player leaves the area the torso will be gone the next time the player returns.Zombie DogsReturning from the original game are zombie hounds, only these are of accidental infection and aren't the specifically designed Cerberus B.O.W.s. Though they otherwise function very much the same, and are likewise always encountered in packs. They contain the same agility and brutality as a standard dog, though are easy to stunlock as any shot from even a pistol will knock them off balance; continued shots will be able to keep them locked to the ground until death.CrowsMuch like most Resident Evil iterations, Crows only act as more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They are always found to be in a large number, however, and can be very hard to avoid.They only have one attack by way of pecking at the player, which while does little damage will keep the player stuck in a short animation of trying to wave them off.LickerAn advanced mutation of zombies, mostly recognizable for their long tongue and claws. Lickers are extremely agile and fast, have an attack that can commit an instant-kill against the player, and can withstand more damage than the typical zombie. Lickers also have the added advantage of being able to climb up and rest upon flat surfaces, including ceilings. However they often tend to make a breathy growl of sorts, that along with the squishy noise of their movements makes them easy to pick up should one be close by.A licker usually takes between 2-3 shotgun or crossbow attacks to kill one. Though because of their lack of sight, players can potentially avoid encounters with one should they walk past rather than run. However if a player gets close enough, a Licker will always catch on to their presence and give chase regardless of their movement speed. While they can sometimes be encountered alone, they will more often than not be found in groups of at least two.Their attacks often involve their claws; they will swipe the player's leg when close, and when encountered at a distance will give off a loud shriek and then leap through the air in an attempt to maul the player. They will alternatively strike with their tongue and attempt to strangle the player; if the player's health is in the Caution state, there's a high chance the Licker will rip off the player's head completely.Evolved LickerThis is a tougher variant of the Licker that'll be encountered later in the game. They are of a noticeably different shade of color from the regular red Lickers, with a more murky green color to them. They utilize the same attacks as a regular Licker, however they will deal--and can withstand--more damage.Web SpinnersMuch like zombie hounds, these are to be found in nearly every Resident Evil game to date. They are primarily just spiders, though they all also have the ability to poison the player with a gush of poison spit.Ordinarily should a giant spider die with its sack still intact, hundreds of miniature spiders would begin to seep out and attack the player. However for whatever reason this is not the case in Resident Evil 2.Plant 43A smaller, smarter iteration off of Plant 42 from the original Resident Evil. Though while significantly smaller in size, they are still quite resistant to most forms of damage. However they are terribly weak against fire. They primarily attack by spewing a gob of acid at the player from their gaping mouth, though they especially dangerous up close as they will grapple and trap the player with their vines while pouring their acid all over them.There is another variant of the creature that's acid will also poison the player should it hit. They are otherwise the same, and are visually distinctive by their 'head' being of a red color as opposed to green.Giant MothWhile there is only one to be found in the game, the giant moth isn't technically a boss battle. It is encountered within an Umbrella lab and has grown itself a nest. It attacks the player by charging towards them, or spitting poison. While it still has its wings, it is not strong enough to fly very efficiently and can only hover. It is nonetheless quite sturdy and requires around 4 shots from an upgraded desert eagle magnum to down.It's also worth noting that it is completely optional to fight, and is only necessary should players desire to register their handprint to access the locked laboratory door.[CR]Boss Battles[CR]GThe first boss encountered in Scenario A, G was once a small parasitic larvae that was implanted by the mutated William Birkin into either Ben Bertolucci or Brian Irons, depending on which character's story it is. After an allotted time, however, it grows into a much larger, more humanoid creature.It is slow in speed, so its primary source of attack is to vomit out several small larvae to then seek out the player and attempt to force themselves down their throat. Otherwise it can punch the character when close enough, but the primary tactic is to keep a good distance and keep shooting at it, while also trying to shoot any of the swarming larvae on the ground. After enough damage it will ultimately disintegrate.Giant AlligatorThis aptly titled boss is encountered in the sewers. It will surprise attack the player from beneath the sewage water and slowly makes its way through the tunnel; its size means it is impossible to run past it. There are two methods to killing it: first is the basic path of simply unloading whatever the player has into the creature; alternatively the player could drop the gas canister that resides within the middle of the tunnel, and then shoot it once the alligator picks it up with its mouth killing it instantly. If players choose to kill it the old fashioned way, there will be a small stash of ammunition awaiting them next to the tram later in the game.The alligator will always be fought in Scenario A, however if it is killed via the gas canister it will stay dead for the alternate character's Scenario B. Otherwise it must be fought again in much the same way, complete with the gas canister still available; it will also visually be shown wounded to account for the previous battle.T-103 'Mr. X'A mass-produced successor to the T-102 from Resident Evil, the T-103 is only encountered during Scenario B. It is encountered multiple times throughout at scripted moments in the story, often bursting through walls or ambushing from around a corner. A clear way to note if it is about to arrive is if the theme music for the area has stopped.It is usually designed to block the player from progressing, forcing them to kill it before it reaches them. Though it will always walk, and when attacked with a powerful enough weapon such as a shotgun will slow down even further. If it gets close its attacks will do a noticeable amount of damage and can potentially kill the player with only about 4 attacks. It will only use its fists to attack, usually using a hook punch to knock the player back as a method of again forcing players to fight it. Though it will also sometimes do an overhead smash with both hands clasped together -- its most powerful attack.After enough damage has been dealt it will begin to slightly sway before toppling to the floor. Searching its body afterwards will gift the player some ammunition.T-103 Mutated FormUpon inadvertently falling into a vat of molten liquid, the tyrant will re-emerge now mutated and of a completely different boss design. It is only fought once nearing the end, again only during Scenario B, shortly after the player is powering up the escape train. Its trademark jacket has now completely burnt away, revealing a growth in mass, as has its hands formed into large claws.It is now considerably faster and will frequently rush and slash at the player. Its attacks are thusly difficult to avoid, likely forcing most players to simply brute force their way through the fight and hope they have enough healing supplies. Upon enough damage, from around 4-5 upgraded magnum shots for reference, a silhouette of Ada Wong will arrive to drop the player--as either Leon or Claire--a rocket launcher.The player must then quickly rush and equip it, and then fire at the tyrant -- one shot is all it will take to destroy it.William Birkin First FormUpon injecting himself with the G-virus, William Birkin has now transformed into a horrible monstrosity -- one that grows more hideous as the game progresses. Similar to the T-103 he is thusly fought multiple times throughout the game, though each time is a different form, and unlike the T-103 is fought across both Scenarios. Though his first is only fought during Scenario B, in place of where players faced 'G' in Scenario A.His first form is his most comparatively mundane, as he still retains many of his human physical qualities. Though he still has access to incredible strength, and will pull off a nearby pipe which will govern his attacks. He is slow moving, similar to G, and will primarily swing the pipe around randomly -- any attack that hits does a significant amount of damage, however. Similar to G, the primary strategy is to keep at a distance and fire whatever the player has. He can withstand a fair amount of damage, roughly taking about eight grenade rounds. Once enough damage has been inflicted, the boss theme will cut off and he will then seemingly accidentally fall over the edge into the sewers below.William Birkin Second FormThis form is the point where Birkin now literally begins to shed his human qualities in favor of something more monstrous, and is the first William boss for Scenario A. After discarding his pipe, his right arm has grown into an enormous claw, now making him somewhat resemble a tyrant.The battleground is set on a tram platform descending down into Umbrella's underground laboratory. Birkin still only walks, but the arena is of a U shape, with the possibility of the player finding themselves at a dead end. Though area is also wide enough that players should be able to potentially rush past.Birkin of course now attacks with his claw, which has a slightly greater reach than the pipe but roughly does the same amount of damage. He will also take about the same amount of damage to down as before, so as long as players again keep their distance he will eventually begin bleeding and ultimately slump to the floor after receiving enough damage.William Birkin Third FormAt this point William now resembles something more demonic than human, and has access to two equally large claws protruding from his shoulders along with what is now another pair of claws that were once his hands. This form is fought in the B Scenario on the same tram platform as his previous form was fought.He still only walks but each step will now cover more distance, allowing him to more quickly catch up to the player. His attacks also now have a much larger reach than before, and he will periodically enter a stance with all four of his claws raised up. If attacked amidst this stance he will unleash a powerful combo with all four claws and can potentially kill the player outright with this attack. If he isn't able to strike the player with this attack, after so long he will revert back to his default stanceThis form is naturally tougher than the last and can withstand even more damage. Though this time when the battle is over Birkin will leap away onto the wall rather than pass out.William Birkin Fourth FormThe final boss of Scenario A, Birkin has how transformed into some sort of monstrous canine. His shoulder claws have morphed into his front legs, and he has grown considerably in mass with a large maw for a mouth.Now running on four 'legs', this form is his fastest by a great deal, and he will commonly rush at the player and grab them with its maw and shake the player around like a ragdoll. It won't kill the player outright but still does a high amount of damage.The arena offers two tall series of tubes, to which Birkin will occasionally jump onto, potentially allowing players some temporary safety and to get in some extra shots. Though it will eventually jump off and may also attack the player simultaneously.In traditional Resident Evil fashion, there is a 5 minute timer ticking down during the battle.William Birkin Final FormThe final boss of Scenario B, William has ultimately become an amorphous blob of a creature, made up of a variety of eyes, teeth, claws, and assimilated corpses all over. Probably the simplest boss in the game, it exists more for spectacle than to serve as a challenge. Set on the cargo cart of the escape train, the player is trapped between a locked door and the slowly slithering horror that is now William Birkin.The player is simply tasking with unloading whatever they have into it from their position. At this point players should have access to a single shot left for their rocket launcher which, while it won't kill Birkin, will deal a fair bit of damage. After so much punishment Birkin begins to decompose, while the door conveniently unlocks behind the player allowing them to escape. Upon opening the door the game will end, switching to a CG cutscene showcasing Birkin's ultimate demise due to the self-destruction of the train -- after the characters themselves have escaped.[CR]Unlockables[CR]Like most Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 2 is packed with unlockable content to help supply replay value and prolong the game's lifespan.Ranking & Unlockable WeaponsArt from Leon's results screenThere is a ranking system dependent on how players finish the game. Ranks are determined by how fast the player finished the game, how many first aid sprays are used, and how often the player saved. The ranks range from D to S, with S being the best.To attain an S rank the player must complete the game under 2 hours, without using any first aid sprays and only saving once. Upon achieving an S rank, or even A rank, for both scenarios, the player will be rewarded with a submachine gun, a gatling gun, and a rocket launcher, all with infinite ammo, but only for the completed scenario pair. They will be awaiting in the item box should the player decide to play through the completed scenarios once more.CostumesOne of Leon's alternate costumes.S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team pilot Brad Vickers is killed by the B.O.W. monster Nemesis during Resident Evil 3. However because it is initially set before the events of Resident Evil 2, Brad is thusly given time to return in zombie form for Resident Evil 2.To locate him, players must head from the beginning of Scenario A to the Police Station without collecting any items -- not even the shotgun/bowgun that drops from Robert Kendo. Upon successfully reaching the station, the Brad Vickers zombie will be wandering below in the underpass. He can withstand more punishment than a regular zombie, though an upward shot to the head with the shotgun will still kill him instantly as like any other. Whence killed, his corpse will yield a key that will unlock a locker in the station's darkroom. In it are costumes for Leon and Claire.Claire wearing her alternate biker outfitLeon unlocks two different outfits, whereas Claire only unlocks one. However Claire is instead gifted a six-shot revolver exclusive to her, to tie in with the cowgirl theme of her alternate costume. Leon, while he doesn't obtain a new weapon, will now wield handguns sideways with one hand; this stance then gives Leon increased firing speed with handguns, though can be only be used while wearing one of the alternate costumes. Should players modify Leon's H&K handgun, however, he will lose the stance in favor of the burst-fire.The N64 version has one additional exclusive costume per character.If players manage to trigger the appearance of zombie Brad in Scenario A, he will then show up once again in the same location in the alternate character's Scenario B without any other prerequisites.The 4th Survivor4th Survivor title screenA small side-story starring U.S.S. agent H.U.N.K., after he was able to escape the clutches of the mutated William Birkin, can be unlocked via attaining at least a rank A for either set of an A & B scenario.Beginning at the entrance to the station's sewers, it tasks players as H.U.N.K. to make it to the RPD helipad for extraction. However H.U.N.K.s supplies are limited, and no more can be found amidst the story. Furthermore, all of the enemies from the main game make an appearance, including two appearances of the Mr. X tyrant.H.U.N.K.s inventory is as such:H&K Pistol.150 spare 9mm bullets.Remington Shotgun.15 spare shells.Desert Eagle Magnum.8 spare magnum bullets.Mixed herb made up of a single green & blueMixed herb made up of a single green & blue.And in his unique inventory slot is the G-Virus vial he successfully stole from William Birkin.As such, players are to choose wisely as to what to use against what enemies, as there are many more enemies in the player's path than they have bullets. Upon reaching the helipad it shows H.U.N.K. signalling for his escape chopper and flying away. In all ports from the Dualshock version onward, a timer will tick up showing how long it took the player to finish.The mini-story's title is somewhat inconsistent with the amount of characters whom actually survive, with Leon, Claire, Sherry, and Ada also eventually being revealed to have escaped making H.U.N.K. the technically 5th survivor of Resident Evil 2.The Tofu SurvivorTofu Survivor title screen; Tofu is unfortunately not shown to wear Jill's beret in-gameA parody of The 4th Survivor minigame, Tofu Survivor plays near identical, only instead of controlling H.U.N.K. players instead take control of a sentient piece of Japanese tofu. This mode is unlocked upon attaining at least an A rank for all four scenarios.The objective is the exact same as The 4th Survivor, as is the enemy placements, however the character of Tofu only but has a combat knife to defend itself with. It does also have some additional herbs, however, and it is noticeably sturdier than the other characters in the game. Nonetheless, The Tofu Survivor is arguably the toughest minigame in the main Resident Evil series.Because of the lack of reliable weaponry on hand, players are to instead attempt to avoid most encounters, using such tactics as the fan-coined ''wall hug'' of running diagonally into a wall to attempt to pass enemies. Completing the minigame yields the same ending as The 4th Survivor, and this too features a timer to help clock how long it took players to complete from the Dualshock version onward.The mode itself originated as a joke by the developers, after they would use the Tofu character model to help in designing collision detection.Extreme BattleExtreme Battle title screenThe third and final minigame of Resident Evil 2, Extreme Battle is something more of a score-focussed mode, complete with multiple characters and difficulty levels -- 3 in total. It is unlocked upon completing either set of A & B scenarios. It is only available in certain ports of Resident Evil 2, however.Players are tasked in trying to locate four ''anti-virus bombs'' within the Raccoon Police Station--the specific locations of the bombs are randomized--though they first begin at Umbrella's laboratory near the end of the story. Players are to choose from four different characters to determine their equipment, although only two are available at the outset; the other two must be unlocked by climbing up the difficulty levels. Unlike the previous modes, players can locate more supplies amidst their travels and can even save their progress with an ink ribbon & typewriter like in the main game.There are leaderboards available that'll track how long it took for the player to complete which level, and with which character. However players can only strive to beat the pre-entered scores or their own, as there is no online functionality across any of the ports.CharactersLeon S.

Chris RedfieldThe original hero from Resident Evil, Chris is unlocked upon completing Level 2. His STARS beretta pistol is exclusive to him and has a chance to pop a zombie's head similar to the magnum. Because of Chris' experience, he can handle the recoil of the upgraded shotgun more so than Leon, giving it less kickback. The sound effects related to Chris receiving damage are recycled from the original Resident Evil.Beretta PistolRemington Shotgun (Upgraded Version)Rocket LauncherInk RibbonFirst Aid SprayLevelsEach of the three levels gets progressively harder from one to the next, by introducing new enemies (including William Birkin in his canine form) and remixing old enemy placements, to decreasing the amount of available supplies to collect out in the world.[CR]Version Differences[CR]Resident Evil 2 (Sony PlayStation)The original version of Resident Evil 2 released on January 21, 1998 in North America. One week later, Biohazard 2 would be released in Japan. The content was spread across two discs and featured considerable improvements to the mechanics and graphics from the preceding Resident Evil (see \"Gameplay\" section above).Supposedly, the Japanese release was considerably easier than its North American counterpart, featuring different item placement, better firepower and auto-aim enabled by default. Additionally, the Japanese version did not include scenes of player characters being eaten by zombies after death and gore was diminished along with some violent depictions.Resident Evil 2: DualShock Version (Sony PlayStation)Virtually the same as the original PlayStation version, but with added functionality to accept the DualShock Controller released after the game's original release date. The game featured vibration functions and analog controls. This release also saw the addition of Extreme Battle, an unlockable mini game where the player needs to reach the police station and find four anti-biohazard bombs. Also, a cheat code for unlimited ammo was added.The Japanese DualShock version featured a \"USA Version\" mode, bringing the difficulty up to par with its overseas counterpart; this release also had feature parity with the North American version and sported the same add-ons and DualShock-only functions. The violence scenarios and gore, however, still remained censored, edited or omitted.In 2009, the DualShock Version was released on the PlayStation Store at a $5.99 price point and is compatible with both the PlayStation 3 and PSP.Resident Evil 2 Platinum (Windows '98 PC)Contained the same content as the PlayStation releases, except the Dualshock Version's mini games were unlocked from the start. The game was spread across two CD-ROMs.Resident Evil 2 (Nintendo 64)After commercial success on the PlayStation, Capcom commissioned Angel Studios (later renamed to Rockstar San Diego) to create an Nintendo 64 port. The PlayStation original, however, had over 700MB of data spread across its two discs and the highest capacity for a Nintendo 64 cartridge was a comparatively tiny 64MB (512 Mbit). Despite the software media limitations, the N64 port was comparable to the PlayStation version with the omission of the DualShock Version's Extreme Battle mini game. This version also added additional documents called EX files, which referenced numerous plot details and Resident Evil Zero, which at that time was still in development for the N64 before being moved over to the GameCube later on.Thanks to the Nintendo 64's additional 4MB of RAM added by the (optional) Expansion Pak, the game displayed at a higher resolution at times, switching between 640x480 and 320x240 (the PlayStation version's native resolution) depending on how many enemies were in the area. If the player defeated the enemies, then the game would automatically switch to the higher resolution. Without the Expansion Pak, the game's visuals closely resembled the PlayStation original.Audio from this version suffered the most compression despite the addition of surround sound (which was absent from previous releases). All content fit on one cartridge and did not force players to switch between two different pieces of media.Biohazard 2 Value Plus (Sega Dreamcast)The Value Plus version is a Japanese-exclusive release that came out one year after the DualShock version and in the same year as the PC and N64 ports. It was bundled with a disc containing a demo of Resident Evil: Code Veronica and assorted music from various games in the series. Since the Dreamcast ran on a Windows CE operating system, this version of Resident Evil 2 was identical to the PC release (see above). However, if the player had a VMU, they could see their character's health on the display.Resident Evil 2 (Sega Dreamcast)Resident Evil 2 on Dreamcast in territories other than Japan is a two-GD ROM set with each disc being a campaign for the two characters, similar to the original PlayStation edition. The Dreamcast version is known for having no drops in the game's framerate and having higher resolution backgrounds than the Playstation, Nintendo 64 and GameCube versions. It also had an \"Extra\" option in the main menu that allowed the player to view concept art and in-game cutscenes. Like the Japanese version, if the player had a VMU, they were able to see their character's health status on the VMU screen.Biohazard 2 PC (Windows XP PC)The same as the PC version released in 1998, except now compatible with Windows XP machines and on one DVD-ROM with uncompressed 640x480 CG scenes. This particular version is a Japanese exclusive released in 2006. It's often referred to as BioHazard 2 SourceNext, after after the company responsible for re-releasing this versionResident Evil 2 (Nintendo Gamecube)Some note this as the definitive version of Resident Evil 2, and while it does not feature any of the EX files on N64, it comes complete with the Extreme Battle minigame. Although it did sport slightly better graphics, background resolutions were worse than the Dreamcast and PC versions. Minor differences such as the voice on the main menu are present. All content is available on one disc.Along with the release of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis on the Gamecube, this particular version is considered a rarity for the system because of low print run.[CR]Development[CR]Resident Evil 1.5Image of Elza equipped with a shotgunAfter the launch of Resident Evil, work immediately began on Resident Evil 2 and was scheduled for a 1997 release. Nearing the end of development, when the game was about 80-90% done, the creators felt the sequel was more of the same and was scrapped. The previous version of the game had a female protagonist named Elza Walker who was eventually replaced by Claire Redfield. She shared many of Claire\u2019s traits such as being an avid fan of motorbikes and was a student. While Claire is the sister of the Chris Redfield, the Resident Evil 1.5 protagonist, Elza, was completely unrelated to any previous Resident Evil character. Leon Kennedy also had a radically different appearance initially, but that too was altered since Capcom believed it held too strong a resemblance to former Resident Evil hero Chris Redfield. Additionally, the policeman named Marvin who dies early on in Resident Evil 2 had a much bigger role in this incarnation; supposedly he would help the player escape the city similar to the role of Barry in Resident Evil 3.Ada in her original researcher outfitFurthermore, the design and layout of the police department was modern and resembled a typical police structure. It lacked the gothic elements of the final police station and used the color gray quite frequently; perhaps in a bid to make the area feel sterile. Finally, amongst other things, were the varieties of the monsters. Sketches and screenshots showcase zombies of different races, monsters that resembled the reapers from Resident Evil 5 and two bosses, which made the cutting room floor named Zeiram and Gorgoda. Zeiram and Gorgoda\u2019s elements of design ultimately were used to create William Birkin\u2019s G-form.The characters had unique and more professional animations for wielding weapons, such as Leon holding his gun up when standing still rather than continuing in his neutral stance.A version of the game that looks to be almost complete is in the confines of a private collection, but other than a 10 minute video of previously unseen footage posted on Youtube, nothing else has been released, much to the dismay of fans. [CR]Remake[CR]On August 12th, 2015, Capcom announced that they will be proceeding with a Resident Evil 2 Remake. No major details were provided, but it is presumed that the game will receive the same treatment as the Gamecube remake of Resident Evil. [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Resident Evil 2 is the only mainline Resident Evil game that doesn't feature any idle animations.It was Hideki Kamiya's idea specifically to reintroduce Brad Vickers as a zombie.Ada Wong's CG character model wasn't finished, and is thusly the only character of the main four to not show up in any of the CG cutscenes.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]There are two soundtrack CD releases for Resident Evil 2, the first release came out in January 29, 1998 and consisted of 31 tracks and one CD. But since not all music contained in the game was included, a new version was release in August 21, 1998 named Biohazard 2 Complete Track and with 50 tracks and two CDs. The soundtrack was composed by Masami Ueda, Shun Nishigaki and Shusaku Uchiyama.Biohazard 2 Original SoundtrackBiohazard 2 Complete TrackCD 11. \"The Beginning of Story\"2. \"Annette's Recollection\"3. \"Normal End Title\"4. \"Special End Title\"5. \"Credit Line of Whole Staff\"6. \"Prologue\"7. \"Raccoon City\"8. \"The Front Hall\"9. \"The First Floor\"10. \"The Second Floor\"11. \"Secure Place\"12. \"Leon With Claire\"13. \"The Library\"14. \"Sherry's Theme\"15. \"The Basement of Police Station\"16. \"'T'-A\"17. \"The First Malformation of 'G'\"18. \"Ada's Theme\"19. \"The Marshalling Yard (The First Half)\"20. \"The Marshalling Yard (The Latter Half)\"21. \"The Second Malformation of 'G'\"22. \"The Underground Laboratory\"23. \"Is Ada Spy!?\"24. \"Escape From Laboratory\"25. \"Good Bye, Leon\"26. \"Mother\"27. \"One More Kiss\"28. \"'T'-B\"29. \"The Third Malformation of 'G'\"30. \"And After That...\"31. \"Credit Line\"1. \"The Evil Eye\"2. \"Prologue ~To Know The True End~\"3. \"Weapons Don't Give Us Relief\"4. \"Falling Victim to the Ex-Neighbors\"5. \"Drove the Passengers to be the Living Dead\"6. \"Left Alone?\"7. \"The Buildup of Suspense\"8. \"Screaming Target\"9. \"Above the Blood Pool\"10. \"Nothing More to do Here\"11. \"Hope Against Hope\"12. \"Who's That Lady?\"13. \"Madness Under the Mask\"14. \"Now in Two Pieces\"15. \"Embryo in its Cradle\"16. \"His Final Scoop\"17. \"Destined to be Malformed\"18. \"Don't Look Up\"19. \"Dropping Into the Water\"20. \"Wandering Alone\"21. \"Dropping Again\"22. \"Heads Up!\"23. \"Women Squaring Off\"24. \"The Gigantic Alligator\"25. \"'It' is After You\"26. \"This is My Nest\"27. \"Like a Shadow\"28. \"The Shadow is Gone?\"29. \"Wreckage of the Mad Experiment\"30. \"Fearful is No Word for It\"31. \"Maximize Your Survival Instinct\"32. \"To Another Nightmare\"33. \"The Daredevil Four\"34. \"Your Mission\"35. \"Set About the Mission\"36. \"Mission Accomplished\"37. \"Under Cover of Darkness\"38. \"Long and Gloomy Underground Passage\"39. \"We Will Never Die\"40. \"Find the Final One!\"41. \"Dawn Never Fails to Come\"42. \"'The Ultimate Bio-Weapon' Medley\"CD 21.

The game begins one day before the events of Resident Evil 2, eventually surpassing them and extending into the day after.This time the player finds themselves traversing a substantial portion of Raccoon City itself while also taking a few short trips to locales made famous from RE2, such as the R.P.D. (Raccoon Police Station). Throughout the game, Jill is hunted by the Umbrella corporation's latest B.O.W., and title character, Nemesis. Similarly to the T-103 in RE2, the Nemesis will appear at scripted occasions during the story and will relentlessly try to kill Jill Valentine. Unlike the T-103, Nemesis can follow Jill through rooms and sometimes even comes equipped with his own unique Rocket Launcher.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B] & ControlsJill at the hands of NemesisResident Evil 3 largely plays much like its predecessors Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and is split between a mixture of combating B.O.W.s, exploration and puzzles. Fitted with the notorious 'tank controls' the series became known for, players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles.Players are also forced to stay stuck on the spot when attempting to use their weapons, though auto-aim is turned on by default, so the character will at least aim automatically at whichever enemy is closest -- even if it's located outside of the player's own perspective. Climbing up/down stairs is now performed manually, allowing the player and even zombies to walk up/down staircases at their own pace. Furthermore, Resident Evil 3 is the first to include the 180 degree turn, which allows the player character to instantaneously turn around by simultaneously pressing down and the 'run' button.Another new mechanic is that of a dodge maneuver. By hitting the R1 or R2 buttons (Default PS1 controls), or by holding the R1 or R2 button then hitting the X button right before an attack, Jill will dodge out of the way. If the character is equipped with a pistol and should also escape via a roll, Jill will go onto one knee which'll give her a temporary boost to her fire-rate with her handgun. However whichever dodge animation the character would use is random.There exists some destructible objects throughout the game which can help the player in fending off enemies. Such examples include explosive barrels or a loose crane box.The story is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.Encountering differing enemies across multiple playthroughs was introduced in Resident Evil 3 to add a sense of unpredictability. Where a player may have faced a pack of zombie hounds in a particular area, during another playthrough may then find a group of Beta Hunters there instead. A select few encounters with Nemesis are randomized as well.Playable CharactersResident Evil 3 only stars one selectable character, being Jill Valentine. Though there will also be a short portion of the story where players will temporarily take control of UBCS soldier, Carlos Oliveira. Carlos functions exactly like Jill, though he does have at least one unique weapon that Jill cannot collect -- two if playing on Hard mode, being his SIGPRO handgun and M4A1 assault rifle.On one specific occasion when fighting Nemesis in either a restaurant or News Office, Carlos may provide assistance as a friendly NPC. He will use his M4A1 assault rifle, but only on its Manual mode setting, giving it a three-shot burst fire. Carlos can also die during this fight, which will result in a game over, however he is significantly more durable than the player during this fight.While not playable from a story context, fellow UBCS soldiers Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef are playable in the unlockable Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal minigame, as detailed further below.DifficultyLike Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3 offers up two distinct difficulty settings, 'Easy' and 'Hard', with no in-between. The differences are significantly more drastic than between the 'Rookie' and 'Normal' modes in RE2, however. In Easy mode, players start off with an M4A1 Assault Rifle (which is otherwise inaccessible besides as an unlockable in Hard mode), and located within the first inventory box players find in the Warehouse save room is a hefty selection of the game's weaponry, with a large portion of spare ammunition to go along with them. The player's default inventory is also increased from the eight slots in Hard mode to ten (eventually maximising at twelve during the story), which functions across both the main game and the unlockable Mercenaries minigame.When playing on Easy Mode, however, players cannot acquire the Nemesis briefcase awards for beating him, and the Mine Thrower weapon is removed entirely.InventoryInventory screen, with the character's health up top.All characters across the game feature the same inventory space of either eight slots or ten, depending on the difficulty as mentioned above. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.When switching between playing as Jill and Carlos in the story, the item boxes will not carry over any items.HealthA character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine (green) - The character is in good health.Caution (yellow) - The character is roughly at half health.Caution (orange) - The character is roughly at a quarter of health.Danger (red) - The character is approaching death.Poison (purple) - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.Carrying on the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, with the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three types of herbs, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will no restore any health.Red Herb - On its own can do nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will now heal roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, including Poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing.Live Selection ChoicesDuring key moments in the game, Jill will be faced with a ''Live Selection''. These sequences temporarily stall the action and allow the player to decide how they'd like to react to a situation from two possible choices. More often than not these are based around Nemesis encounters. As time still progresses, albeit slowly, in these instances, the player is faced with the added pressure of a timer. If the player doesn't choose quickly enough, a decision will be made for them -- usually inflicting damage upon Jill in the process.A more detailed listing of the choices and their effects can be found further below.Ammo CraftingGunpowder can now be collected in order for Jill to create her own ammo. This allows for the creation of different types of ammo that would not be available otherwise.There are three individual types of gunpowder in Resident Evil 3; types A and B are found throughout the game and the only way obtain type C is by combining one pot of type A and B. By combining these gun powders with either the Reloading tool or standard grenade rounds, various types of ammunition can be created.By combining the same kind of gun powder repeatedly with the Reloading tool you can create advanced ammo types for the handgun and shotgun. The number of pots used in a single combination will not affect the progression for obtaining the enhanced ammo, so in order to obtain them as quickly as possible it is best to use a single pot each time.Below is a complete breakdown for combining every type of gun powder combination with both the Reloading Tool and Grenade Rounds as well as how many combinations is necessary to unlock the enhanced ammo. Difficulty will only affect the amount of ammo created, it does not have any effect on obtaining the upgraded ammo.Basic AmmoBases Results for Mixing with the Reloading toolGun Powder A: Handgun RoundsGun Powder B: Shotgun ShellsGun Powder C: Grenade RoundsGun Powder AAB: Shotgun ShellsGun Powder BBA: Handgun RoundsGun Powder AC: Flame RoundsGun Powder BC: Acid RoundsGun Powder CC: Freeze RoundsGun Powder CCC: Magnum RoundsBase Results for Mixing with Grenade RoundsA: Flame RoundsB: Acid RoundsC: Freeze RoundsEnhanced AmmoHandgun Rounds (Gun Powder A + Reloading Tool)Number of times for first ammo count increase - 4Number of times for second ammo count increase - 3Total Number for ability to create upgraded ammunition - 8Shotgun Shells (Gun Powder B + Reloading Tool)Number of times for first ammo count increase 1 - 4Number of times for second ammo count increase 2 - 3Total Number for ability to create upgraded ammunition - 9SavingLike every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 3 requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersJill ValentineThe returning heroine from the first game. Jill is an ex-S.T.A.R.S operative who stayed behind in Raccoon City to monitor the Umbrella Corp.'s activities, while the rest of the team (minus Brad Vickers) went to Europe to investigate and gather information. As confident as ever in her abilities, Jill's experience with B.O.W. threats has only hardened her resolve. While she is initially distrustful of the U.B.C.S. that arrive to aid civilians, she is reluctantly forced to work alongside a few remaining members in order to make her escape from the city.Carlos OliveiraA mercenary who is part of the U.B.C.S. hailing from South America. Carlos is initially portrayed as somewhat laid-back and even a little narcissistic. However he quickly changes his tone as the game progresses, and proves to be a valuable ally throughout the game. He is somewhat infamous for his accent changing midway through the game.Mikhail VictorLieutenant of the U.B.C.S., hailing from Russia. Mikhail is first encountered gravely wounded aboard a train which acts as the remaining U.B.C.S. members' base of sorts. Despite his injuries, Mikhail is shown to be a proud and dedicated soldier and holds few ties to the Umbrella Corp. itself.Nicholai GinovaefA Sergeant of the U.B.C.S. hailing from Russia also. Nicholai is the cold and calculating member of the group, who decides on the plan to ride the train to the Clock Tower for extraction. His first name's unusual spelling (as opposed to the more traditional \"Nikolai\" or \"Nikolay\") is likely the result of a localization error; however, the spelling has become canonical for all other appearances of this character throughout the franchise.Brad VickersThe cowardly Alpha team pilot of S.TA.R.S. Brad opted to stay behind in Raccoon City as he didn't want to get involved with the information gathering of the Umbrella Corp. Despite cutting ties with S.T.A.R.S., he is still considered a target by the Nemesis B.O.W.NemesisThe primary antagonist and titular character of the game, Nemesis is a unique form of B.O.W. capable of comprehending commands, executing mission objectives independently and utilizing high-power firearms. Its sole mission is to hunt down and assassinate the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members in Raccoon City as specified by Umbrella.PlotNemesis advancing towards JillThe plot of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis follows Jill Valentine and her escape from Raccoon City. Jill initially travels to the Raccoon City Police Station, and after witnessing S.T.A.R.S. member Brad Vickers being brutally murdered by The Umbrella Corporation's latest bio-weapon, code named \"Nemesis'', takes shelter in the R.P.D. Jill is able escape the grasp of Nemesis and meets up with surviving U.B.C.S. soldiers consisting of Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef, who have fortified a broken train carriage as a base of operations. Mikhail however is found to be injured severely leaving only Carlos and Nicholai of any use.The train requires some key components to be able to be of any use however. Nicholai reluctantly accepts Jill's help and they all head out to search for the supplies needed. Throughout Jill's search she will encounter Nicholai in either the gas station or the Management Office, depending on certain choices made by the player. Either way, Nicholai is presumed dead after an attack by zombies or by an explosion. After Jill helps repair the train they begin to travel to the U.B.C.S. evacuation point. Not before Nemesis forces himself aboard the train, however. Mikhail then sacrifices himself with a grenade to try and destroy the Nemesis but at the extra cost of causing the train to crash.Jill managed to survive the crash and used the Clock tower's dong mechanisms to signal the rescue helicopter, which is soon after shot down by Nemesis. Jill will then have an unavoidable duel against her stalker, but not before getting infected by the T-Virus courtesy of the Nemesis. Jill will still manage to prevail against the Nemesis with him lumbering off and passing out in a field of flames. Carlos arrives soon after and carry's an unconscious Jill to the Clock tower chapel.Jill finding UBCS soldier Carlos Oliveira on the floor in the News OfficeAt this point the player takes control of Carlos and must travel to the hospital. Along the way, again determined by certain choices made by the player, Carlos will learn of Nicholai's survival and also his true intentions either by another UBCS soldier - who is soon enough blown up by a trap set by Nicholai - or through Nicholai himself. It is revealed that he is one of the ''Supervisors'' and was meant to observe the UBCS's attempts to fight the BOW's for combat-data. For extra cash, he is now killing off the remaining supervisors to be the sole survivor. After a brief encounter with a now mutated Nemesis, Carlos will concoct a vaccine and deliver it to Jill to bring her to full health. Carlos then mentions that there is 'something' he has to do and leaves Jill in the chapel alone. The player then regains control of Jill.Jill then travels through the Raccoon City park eventually encountering Nemesis once again. Nemesis attacks Jill causing her to flee into the nearby power plant. Jill will meet up with Carlos once more and will be filled in on information regarding the fate of Raccoon City. It has been decided that Raccoon City is to be levelled completely via a missile bombing, regardless of survivors, to try and contain the virus. Both Carlos and Jill opt to split-up and find any means of escaping.Throughout Jill's travels, she will once again encounter Nicholai. Either outside the dumping facility or piloting the last helicopter, to which he is either killed by the nemesis or by Jill. Another possibility is Nicholai may actually escape the city too. Regardless, Jill will encounter the Nemesis yet again in the waste room. Manipulating the pipes so they spew acid over Nemesis, Jill is able to beat the Nemesis to such an extent that he eventually loses near all of his limbs. Jill then manages to obtain an Umbrella scientist ID card and uses it to make her way to the radio room, to which she will either receive a broadcast from an 'old friend' should Nicholai manage to get to the last helicopter, or will be greeted by Carlos advising Jill to have hope.Jill, watching from a helicopter as Raccoon City faces its destruction.Jill will make her way down stumbling into the Rail-Gun room, to which the carcass of the Nemesis will soon fall down from above. After feasting on a deceased stage II T-103, it then mutates further into a large almost squid-like creature. With the use of the Rail-Gun, Jill finally puts an end to the Nemesis. She will then take an elevator to the outside and escape via helicopter, which is piloted either by Barry Burton or Carlos depending on a prior choice made by the player.Watching as the city faces its destruction, the game ends with Jill determined now more than ever to put an end to Umbrella and make them pay for their crimes.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Combat KnifeA standard combat knife that Jill has had since the Mansion Incident. Largely useless because of its limited reach and minimal damage, the knife is primarily intended for use should the player run severely low on ammo, and even then it's often advised just to run instead.Beretta M92F Custom \"Samurai Edge\"A custom Beretta handgun that uses 9mm rounds. It was built by the Kendo Gun Shop under orders from S.T.A.R.S. weapon specialist Barry Burton for the S.TA.R.S. team. Unfortunately, most of the S.T.A.R.S. team were declared deceased or MIA for when the firearm was ready, with Barry Burton, Chris Redfield, Rebecca Chambers, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker as the only proprietors. This weapon was eventually retconned to become the Samurai Edge pistol, to which all STARS members had their own unique variant.While it has a noticeably faster rate of fire over the starting handguns from Resident Evil 2, its overall damage output and stopping power is low, making it only suitable for the lesser enemies of the game such as zombies.Maximum Ammo Count: 15 roundsStandard Ammunition: H. Gun Bullets (9x19mm Parabellum rounds) STI Eagle 6.0A custom handgun mostly used for sport. This is attained by defeating the Nemesis on Hard mode twice during any of the encounters. First encounter will reward players with Eagle Parts A, and the second with Eagle Parts B. From there the player need only combine them to receive the handgun, fully loaded. It is considerably faster than Jill's S.T.A.R.S. custom, and has a moderate chance to pop a zombies head much like the Magnum Revolver, killing it instantly.Maximum Ammo Count: 15 roundsStandard Ammunition: H. Gun Bullets (9x19mm Parabellum rounds) SIGPRO SP2009The standard arms handgun for the U.B.C.S. mercenaries who are sent to rescue the civilians of Raccoon City. It is fundamentally the same weapon as Jill's default STARS custom, though it has a unique gun model and firing sound effect. It is only available for use by players during the portion where players briefly take control of Carlos in the main game, and when playing as Nicholai during the Mad Jackal mini-game.While it's possible he could be using a different pistol, Brad Vickers' handgun shares the same firing sound effect as the SIGPRO.Maximum Ammo Count: 15 roundsStandard Ammunition: H. Gun Bullets (9x19mm Parabellum rounds)Benelli M3S ShotgunA reliable shotgun, with a good, strong kick that can damage multiple enemies if they're close together enough. As is tradition with shotguns in Resident Evil, the player can aim up when a zombie is close and there'll be a high chance to completely destroy the head, or can alternatively aim low under the same circumstances to shoot a zombie's legs off.Maximum Ammo Count: 7 shellsStandard Ammunition: Shotgun Shells (12-gauge shells)Western Custom M37 ShotgunA faster, and equally as powerful, shotgun alternative to the Benelli. Like the Eagle Handgun, this western classic is only attained by beating the Nemesis multiple times on Hard mode. Though to have him drop the parts to build the shotgun, players must beat him five consecutive times. The first two to unlock the Eagle handgun parts, the next to unlock a first aid spray case, and the final two for the parts to create the M37.Despite its in-game classification as a shotgun, this weapon's appearance is based on a customized Winchester Model 1892 rifle commonly referred to as the \"Mare's Leg\".Maximum Ammo Count: 7 shellsStandard Ammunition: Shotgun Shells (12-gauge shells)S&W M629C MagnumOne of the most powerful weapons in the game, the Magnum is efficient against all enemies. It can kill practically every regular enemy with a single shot and is a great contender against boss battles. It has high recoil, however, and ammo is incredibly scarce.Maximum Ammo Count: 6 roundsStandard Ammunition: Magnum Bullets (.44 Magnum rounds)M4A1 Assault RifleA semi-hidden weapon that is mostly recognized as Carlos Oliveira's trademark firearm. If the player chooses to play the story mode on the easy setting, Jill will start off with this weapon from the beginning. Otherwise it is only unlockable through the Mad Jackal minigame, that which can be bought with cash accumulated through completions and/or attempted completions of the mode.It has two selectable firing settings, Auto and Manual. Auto sets its firing rate to fully-automatic, whereas Manual will set it to a three-shot burst, while also changing the player's firing stance when in use to aiming down its sights as opposed to from the hip.Maximum Ammo Count: 100 rounds (indicated by percentage)Standard Ammunition: 5.56mm NATO roundsMine ThrowerAn unorthodox weapon only found by the player during the Hard mode setting. It fires mines at the enemy which fester within for a couple of seconds before exploding. Should it be combined with the infinite ammo belt, or is equipped while the 'Infinite ammo for all weapons' unlockable setting is in effect, it will instead fire instant-explosion mines.Maximum Ammo Count - N/AStandard Ammunition - M.T. roundsHk-p Grenade LauncherOne of the most powerful, and also diverse, weapons, it can equip a multiple number of grenade types. It's most commonly equipped with the standard grenade rounds, but it can also be fitted with flame, acid, and even freeze rounds.It's a master of all trades, and the ideal weapon for many of the boss battles. It's also made convenient in that it can stock as much ammo as players can find, so long as they keep it to the same grenade type. Should the player decide to switch grenade types, the accumulated grenades players had equipped will be switched back into their inventory while only taking up a single slot.Maximum Ammo Count - N/AStandard Ammunition - Grenade roundsGatling GunAnother unlockable weapon that can only be attained via the Mad Jackal minigame. It has infinite ammo and can tear through anything, though it has a slow build up.Maximum Ammo Count - InfiniteStandard Ammunition - N/AM66 Rocket LauncherAn old four-shot launcher that can be found near the end of the main game, and can also be unlocked with infinite ammo via the Mad Jackal minigame. It can kill every enemy, excluding bosses, with a single shot.Maximum Ammo Count - InfiniteStandard Ammunition - N/A[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Basic EnemiesZombiesThe zombie is the most common adversary among most Resident Evil games, including Resident Evil 3. They are generally weak, though can potentially overwhelm with their numbers. While they are also slow and sluggish in movement, they will sometimes break into a quick sprint. They will generally attempt to bite at the player character, though if the player is above or below, they will instead attempt to vomit acid towards them. All weaponry is effective, though the handguns and shotguns of the game are the most efficient. Zombie HoundAnother trademark enemy of the series, the Zombie Hounds are always encountered in packs, and contain the same agility and brutality as a standard dog. They're rather weak, however, and can be taken down swiftly with a few handgun or shotgun shots. They are easy to stunlock as well, as any shot from even a pistol will knock them off balance; continued shots will be able to keep them locked to the ground until death. Drain DeimosThese are exclusive to Resident Evil 3 and were conceived accidentally as infected fleas. They have the ability to crawl up walls and surfaces and are rather fast. They usually operate on four limbs, though will occasionally rise to two when agitated and will charge at the player with increased speed. If grabbed, it resembles the creature to be sucking on the character's face, doing a moderate amount of damage. Killing Drain Deimos requires a few shotgun rounds, though It's also easy to avoid them altogether since they like to crawl around walls and ceilings, and will often only opt to give chase at the last moment. Brain SuckerThese are almost identical to the Drain Deimos, though they can inflict poison on the player and have a more greenish look to them over the murky orange the Drain Deimos have. CrowsMuch like most Resident Evil iterations, Crows only act as more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They are always found to be in a large number, however, and can be very hard to avoid. They only have one attack by way of pecking at the player, which while does little damage will keep the player stuck in a short animation of trying to wave them off. Beta HuntersReturning from the original Resident Evil, these are mutated Hunter models that are distinctively red over their standard green Alpha counterparts. They are equally as deadly, however, and are always encountered with at least another around the corner. They are formidable enemies overall and can still swipe the player's head clean off should their character's health be in the Caution state or lower. The Magnum is the most suited weapon when faced against them for its quick efficiency; automatic weapons are also a valuable asset against Hunters due to their high chance to keep a Hunter stun-locked. Gamma HuntersThese kind of hunters are more related to amphibians--specifically frogs--than lizards. While they share the same body type, in place of fangs and boils they have a large gaping mouth which they can use to swallow a character whole, should the character's health status be in the \"Caution\" or \"Danger\" state. Web SpinnersMuch like zombie hounds, these are to be found in nearly every Resident Evil game to date. They are primarily just spiders, though they all also have the ability to poison the player via a spray of spit. Should a giant spider die with its sack still intact, hundreds of miniature spiders will begin to seep out and attack the player. However they do even less damage than the crows, and should the player leave the area they'll return to find them all gone. Sliding WormsAnother enemy only found in Resident Evil 3, these are worms that have been hatched by the larger Gravedigger worm. They attack by jumping at the player and sticking to them, sucking blood at an exuberant pace because of their increased size. Oddly enough all the player has to do to avoid them is just keep running, no matter the direction; they'll quite literally dive right through the character model and will leave no damage. Should they manage to latch on to the character, however, the player won't be able to leave the area until they've shackled it off. BossesResident Evil 3 features several set piece encounters against powerful boss characters. The majority of these battles are fought against Nemesis in his various incarnations.Nemesis (First Form)Art of the default Nemesis, holding the corpse of Brad Vickers.Nemesis is the most prominent and recurring boss battle the player will face. Initially, he is encountered in his trademark state wearing his huge leather jacket. He will be faced seven times during this iteration, though six of those can be avoided. The player can still face off against Nemesis, however, and may even be able to temporarily down him for the time being. Should the player be playing on the Hard mode setting, Nemesis will drop a reward each time he falls. He will usually rely on his brute strength to attack the player, punching and throwing Jill around with ease. However, he also has an attack where he grabs the character and then attempts to force his tentacle down their throat. This attack is tremendously powerful, and can kill the player when they're in the Caution state.Sometimes he will be equipped with his own personal rocket launcher, which as one would expect does a significant amount of damage if hit by a rocket. If close enough, he will still attack by using the launcher as a melee weapon, which does slightly more damage than his regular melee attacks. Ammunition for his launcher is limited, however, and after enough shots he will discard the launcher and revert back to his normal moveset. The option to flee is always there--minus the seventh, which forces the player to face him for story purposes--however Nemesis will give chase up until a point, and will even stalk the player through different rooms, which at the time was unheard of for the series. Running from Nemesis can prove to be just be difficult as fighting him, however, as he can catch up to the player with ease -- often with a quick punch that'll do damage to the player. Fortunately he will only only ever use his right hand, so it is possible to read these patterns and avoid his attacks.A minor variation of Nemesis' original form can optionally be fought in the Clock Tower courtyard. This version of the Nemesis now has an exposed tentacle he'll use as a whip for long distance. However, his standard move-set is still available and he largely requires the same tactics to best. However, this particular state of Nemesis is only faced depending on if the player decided to use the emergency brake whilst riding the runaway cable car, otherwise Jill will face the default Nemesis equipped with his rocket launcher.Nemesis (Second Form)After the climactic battle in the courtyard, the successive damage inflicted by Jill and Carlos, and the fire he passed out in after the previous battle, Nemesis's leather jacket has now been completely torn, exposing tentacles and boils that have formed across his body. The player will encounter this form of Nemesis at least twice; first as Carlos--and again as Jill if the player doesn't do enough damage during his part of the story--and secondly for story purposes, where the player must use valves to spray acid on Nemesis. During this state, he relies greatly on his long range tentacle attacks and will make liberal use of his ability to grab the player and then slam them against the floor multiple times. If the player is in the Caution state, they may be killed outright by this attack. The boss battle against Nemesis' second form nearly destroys him, as he quite literally falls apart after enough damage has been dealt.Nemesis (Final Form)Nemesis is encountered in his third and final form at the end of the game. What remains of the monster will drop down to the ''waste disposal'' center, which houses numerous Tyrant models that have been discarded. Upon locating a mutated Tyrant model, it will begin to feed on it, allowing Nemesis to grow into a large, almost reptilian-like creature. This final form of Nemesis is practically invincible, and can only be defeated via the use of an experimental Railgun -- a weapon that is so powerful that it requires four huge batteries to power and around thirty seconds to fully charge.GravediggerEssentially a giant worm, though one that has its head exposed to reveal a giant array of sharp teeth. The first encounter with Gravedigger is set within a small series of underground corridors. The player needs to press a series of buttons to lower the ladder to climb back up, whilst being in constant danger of having the worm pop out whenever the player gets close to one of the buttons. Through precise timing, the player can leave the area without ever having to fire a single shot. The alternative option is to instead attempt to ward off the worm, though this may take a fairly significant amount of ammunition.Jill faces off against the giant worm a second time during the Raccoon Park section, now with no chance of avoiding a fight this time around. The graveyard where Jill encounters the worm is destroyed and has been transformed into a narrow path. The worm will hide underground most of the time, but will sporadically pop out to give chase and attack. There is a small puddle of water and an electrical light that the player may shoot to electrocute the worm for an instant kill, though it requires incredibly precise timing to pull off.Umbrella HelicopterAn optional boss that can be encountered by choosing the appropriate Live Selection option at the end of the game. This was the first ever non-B.O.W. boss battle the series featured, and has Nicholai in a chopper equipped with duel miniguns. The battle plays out simply, with Jill given some slight cover to avoid the chopper's miniguns, and is then tasked to return fire during the weapons' cooldown period. If Jill takes too long to take Nicholai's chopper down, he will manage to escape. The chopper is rather robust as well, and can withstand up to around 3-4 shots with the rocket launcher.[CR]Live Selection[CR]Throughout the game, the player will find themselves in life-threatening situations that require split-second decisions. These encounters typically result in either evading Nemesis or using part of the environment to the player's advantage to weaken him. Some, however, have a much larger effect on the game and can alter certain scenarios; one in particular will even determine the ending.Live Selection 1: R.P.D. StationUpon reaching the R.P.D. station courtyard for the first time, Nemesis brutally murders Brad Vickers before setting his sights towards Jill.Fight with the monster: The scene immediately reverts back to standard gameplay. Despite the player's option to fight Nemesis, they can still run into the police station through the front entrance, losing Nemesis in the process. This option can also prove useful for retrieving a S.T.A.R.S. ID card earlier than usual by collecting Brad's from his corpse.Enter the police station: Avoids the first encounter with the Nemesis altogether.Do nothing: Nemesis attacks Jill and the scene will proceed as if the the first option had been chosen.Live Selection 2-A: RestaurantThis Live Selection can occur in two separate locations, although the ultimate results of both Live Selections are roughly identical. After meeting Carlos for the first time in the restaurant, their introduction is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Nemesis.Run into the basement: After Jill and Carlos enter the restaurant's basement, some water pipes will burst and begin flooding the room. Several zombies also appear here. Players can escape through a ventilation shaft leading outside, allowing the pair to temporarily evade Nemesis. However, if too much time passes while inside the flooding basement, Jill and Carlos will automatically climb back up the ladder and must confront Nemesis directly.Hide inside the kitchen: Jill locates a lit oil lantern and throws it at Nemesis. This will ignite the gas leak in the restaurant's kitchen, temporarily knocking out Nemesis with an explosion. If playing on the Hard mode setting, Nemesis also drops a weapon case for the player to collect.Do nothing: This forces the player to fight against Nemesis with assistance from Carlos.Live Selection 2-B: Newspaper OfficeThis Live Selection can occur in two separate locations, although the ultimate results of both Live Selections are roughly identical. After meeting Carlos for the first time in the newspaper office, their introduction is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Nemesis.Jump out of the window: Jill and Carlos leap through a nearby window to temporarily evade Nemesis. This option grants access to a locked back alley containing two Red Herbs.Hide in the back: While Jill and Carlos conceal themselves, Nemesis is knocked out by an explosion from an adjacent office. If playing on the Hard mode setting, Nemesis also drops a weapon case for the player to collect.Do nothing: This forces the player to fight against Nemesis with assistance from Carlos.Live Selection 3: Power PlantAt the power plant, Jill opens one of the shutters via a specific button combination at the controls, only to be startled by a horde of zombies banging against a nearby fence.Head to the emergency exit: Initially too rusty to open, Jill will now instead barge through and escape outside, possibly with Nemesis awaiting.Increase electricity output: This will send a strong current through the fence causing all zombie heads to explode; the combination required to open the second shutter will have altered, however.Do nothing: The zombies will break through the fence and attack.Live Selection 4: Parking GarageWhile making her way through the parking garage, a sudden tremor causes the floor beneath Jill to crumble, leaving her dangling from the edge of a deep hole. Although she tries to hoist herself up, two heavy crates begin sliding out of the back of a nearby truck and directly towards Jill.Climb up: Jill climbs up and avoids the sliding crates.Jump down: Jill jumps down and avoids the falling crates. She will then come across a giant dead worm and will have to climb up a ladder to leave the area, finding herself in the outer car park.Do nothing: The crates collide with Jill, sending her to the bottom of the hole as if she had jumped down herself. Jill also takes some damage.Live Selection 5: Cable CarAfter Mikhail sacrifices himself to blow Nemesis out of the cable car with a grenade, Carlos loses control of the vehicle, which is now on a collision course with the Clock Tower.Jump out of the window: Jill will dive out of the window landing just a little ways away from the Clock Tower; Carlos is seen to be still onboard the train as it crashes, however. This options set in motion the event of Carlos arriving to Jill's side after she had fought Nemesis--equipped with his rocket launcher--on her own.Use the emergency brake: This has no effect and will leave Jill aboard the train as it crashes; Carlos can be seen jumping out of the window. This option sets in motion the event of Carlos arriving to fight Nemesis with Jill in the Clock Tower courtyard; he will be knocked unconscious by Nemesis, but will have at least been able to destroy his rocket launcher, dealing a noticeable amount of damage.Do nothing: The same result as the first option.Live Selection 6: Clock TowerJust below the Clock Tower machinery room on an outside balcony, Jill will again be confronted by Nemesis.Use the light: Jill turns on the searchlight, blinding Nemesis, and then pushes him off the balconyUse the cord: Jill throws the electrical cord into a puddle of water close to Nemesis, electrocuting him severely. This will leave Nemesis temporarily unconscious, but he will awake shortly after. If playing on Hard mode, Nemesis will also drop a weapon case.Do nothing: Nemesis will continue to advance towards Jill until the scene reverts back to normal gameplay.Live Selection 7: FactoryJill's way is blocked by Nemesis as she crosses a rickety bridge leading toward the abandoned factory.Push him off: Jill will dodge an attack and then push Nemesis off the bridge into the water below. This sets in motion the ending of Nicholai being killed by Nemesis and Carlos finding the last helicopter.Jump off: Jill will dodge an attack and jump off the bridge landing near the sewer entrance to the facility. This sets in motion the ending of Nicholai reaching the helicopter and Barry Burton arriving to the rescue.Do nothing: Nemesis will knock Jill off the bridge setting in motion the same events of the second option, but with Jill also having taken some damage from the attack.Live Selection 8: HelicopterThis Live Selection only occurs if the player chose to jump off the bridge or do nothing during Live Selection 7. Jill discovers Nicholai attempting to escape from the Factory inside the last functional helicopter in the area.Negotiate with Nicholai: Jill tries to reason with Nicholai about his actions and asks about his motives. Nicholai will answer but then fly away, escaping Raccoon City. This bit of dialogue will also be spoken by Nicholai just before he is killed by Nemesis in the scenario where Jill pushes Nemesis off the bridge.Return fire to the chopper: The player regains control and has the option to return fire at the helicopter, potentially killing Nicholai. If the player takes too long to destroy the helicopter, Nicholai will escape.Do nothing: Nicholai escapes.Live Selection 9: EscapeFollowing the destruction of Nemesis' third form with the experimental railgun, what little of him remains crawls towards Jill in one final attempt to kill her.Exterminate the monster: Jill dodges Nemesis' acid-spit attack and retrieves a nearby .44 magnum. She unloads all six rounds into the quivering mass and puts an end to Nemesis once and for all.Ignore it and evacuate: Jill will continue her escape and head to the elevator.Do nothing: Nemesis spits acid at Jill, poisoning her before the monster finally dies from exhaustion. It reverts back to gameplay allowing the player to head onto the elevator. The poison attack by Nemesis has no effect on the overall ending.[CR]Unlockables[CR]Like most Resident Evils, Resident Evil 3 has a huge assortment of unlockable features to add to the game's replay value including weapons, costumes and a minigame to help prolong the game's length.There also exists 8 Epilogue stories which give the player some insight into what the main characters were doing after their last Resident Evil game appearances. The epilogues give note to the upcoming games, Code Veronica and Resident Evil 4, and also gave players the first ever shot of USS agent HUNK without his helmet. Each Epilogue is unlocked after a single completion, requiring the player to complete Resident Evil 3: Nemesis 8 times to unlock them all.Should the player manage to collect every file in order through the game, upon a new game will find Jill's Diary added to their files. The file is as follows:''August 7thTwo weeks have passed since that day. My wounds have been healed, but I just can't forget it. For most people, it's history now. But for me, whenever I close my eyes, it all comes back clearly. Zombies eating people's flesh and the screams of my teammates dying. No, the wounds in my heart are not healed yet...August 13thChris has been causing a lot of trouble recently. What's with him? He seldom talks to the other police members and is constantly irritated. The other day, he punched Elran of the Boy's Crime department just for accidentally splashing Chris's face with coffee. I immediately stopped Chris, but when he saw me he just gave me a wink and walked away. I wonder what happened to him...August 15thMidnight. Chris, who has been on a leave of absence for a \"vacation,\" called me so I visited his apartment. As soon as I walked into his room, he showed me a couple of pieces of paper. They were part of a virus research report entitled as simply as \"G\". Then Chris told me that, \"The nightmare still continues.\" He went on to say that, \"It's not over yet.\" Ever since that day, he has been fighting all by himself without rest, without even telling me...August 24thChris left the town today to go to Europe. Barry told me that he would send his family to Canada and then he would follow Chris. I decided to remain in Raccoon City for a while because I know that the research facility in this city will be very important to this entire case. In a month or so, I'll be joining with them somewhere in Europe. That's when my real battle begins...''Alternate CostumesMuch like past Resident Evil games, upon completion of RE3 the player is given a letter rank ranging from D (worst) to S (best). It's made up of varying factors such as how long it took to complete, how many first-aid sprays were used, and how often the player saved. These ranks would determine what costumes the player would unlock for any following playthroughs.The costumes were attainable by first collecting the boutique key out of the inventory box, and then unlocking the boutique located near the bar early on. Inside are five dressing rooms, each with one of the available costumes. For the PC version, all costumes (including two extra) are unlocked from the outset and Jill's costume is selected from the very start of the game.Jill's classic S.T.A.R.S. outfit from Resident Evil.A 70s disco outfit.A biker outfit.A standard police officer uniform w /miniskirtA Regina skin, who's best known from the Dino Crisis series.Jill's original costume, but while also wearing a black shirt over her tube top - PC & Dreamcast Exclusive.A casual outfit made of black leather pants and a light blue sleeved shirt - PC & Dreamcast Exclusive.Nemesis RewardsDuring each Nemesis bout amidst the main game on the Hard mode difficulty, should Jill manage to beat him he will drop a silver-case which contains items to help Jill's story, ranging from new weapons to healing items.Bout 1. 9mm Eagle handgun parts A.Bout 2. 9mm Eagle handgun parts B.Bout 3.

An infinite ammo pack that when combined with a weapon will give it unlimited ammo from then on. Note: can only be used once.The Mercenaries: Operation Mad JackalOperation Mad Jackal's title screenAfter a single completion of the game, Operation Mad Jackal becomes available. It has the player choose between the three mercenaries, Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef -- each with their own distinctive weapon load-out that acts as the different difficulties. Mikhail being the easiest, followed by Carlos then Nicholai.The objective is to make it from the fortified train to the warehouse save room. There is, however, a ticking down timer which is based upon a bomb being placed within the mercenaries. To gain more time, the player can kill enemies as well as save hostages - which will reward players with some added supplies. Upon completion, the mercenary is beckoned by a shadowy figure who asks his female associate to hand an Umbrella marked briefcase, which contains the player's cash reward. Even if the player fails due to death, or expiration of time, they are still marked with a rank and given a cash sum. The mode was conceived by Yasuhisa Kawamura, and the design was inspired by The Running Man film.The enemies encountered are all pulled from the main story-line, including multiple encounters with the notorious Nemesis, which sometimes even includes him alongside other BOW creatures as well. One such quirk the minigame features is a section that is patrolled by two Nemesis's - each equipped with a rocket launcher. Through careful manipulation, it's possible to actually force the two Nemesis's to duke it out if the player manoeuvres well enough so one Nemesis may accidentally shoot or attack the other.Completion of the game will award the player a rank between D to S as well a cash sum, which can then be used to purchase the unlockable weapons for the main game and the option to have infinite ammo for all weapons in the main game.The MercenariesMikhail VictorBenelli ShotgunS&W M629C RevolverRocket Launcher21 shotgun rounds18 magnum roundsA mixed herb portion, made of a single green, red and blue herbCarlos OliveiraM4A1 Assault RifleSTI Eagle 6.0.

The way to save them is to kill all enemies within the area, then to press the action button next to the hostage. All hostages are characters taken from the story, and the final two are whichever two other mercenaries that are remaining, after the player's selected character. A hidden timer also persists for each hostage as well, which, if expired, will have the player arrive to find the hostage killed. A quick way for players to determine if a hostage is dead before they reach the body is to note the lack of any opposition within the room the hostage was kept; if there are no enemies in the room, then this signifies that the hostage was killed.The list of the hostages and their whereabouts are as follows:Dario RossoLocated in the garage of the Gas Station.Enemies: ZombiesRewards: Mikhail - shotgun rounds / Carlos - handgun rounds / Nicholai - handgun rounds.Female SurvivorLocated in the top floor of the News Office.Enemies: Zombies.Rewards: Mikhail - shotgun rounds / Carlos - handgun rounds / Nicholai - EX handgun rounds.Brad VickersLocated in the basement of the Restaurant.Enemies: Zombies.Rewards: Mikhail - magnum rounds / Carlos - first aid spray / Nicholai - first aid spray.Marvin BranaghLocated in the emergency exit hallway of the Power Station.Enemies: Nude zombies.Rewards: Mikhail - magnum rounds / Carlos - first aid spray / Nicholai - first aid spray.Nicholai/MikhailLocated in the stock room of the Chemist.Enemies: Gamma Hunters.Rewards: Mikhail - first aid spray / Carlos - first aid spray / Nicholai - first aid spray.Carlos/MikhailLocated in the Bar.Enemies: ZombiesRewards: Mikhail - EX shotgun rounds / Carlos - handgun rounds / Nicholai - handgun rounds.RewardsM4A1 Assault Rifle with infinite ammo for 2000$Gatling Gun with infinite ammo for 3000$Rocket Launcher with infinite ammo for 4000$Infinite ammo for all weapons in Resident Evil 3 9999$ Note: cannot be turned off[CR]Versions[CR]PlayStation: The standard version of the game. Whereas the first two games had separate editions for DualShock controls, the standard version of Resident Evil 3 came with DualShock controls by default.PC: While the PC version includes higher-resolution character models, the backgrounds and cutscenes are lower-resolution. This version allowed the player to pick Jill's costumes from the New Game option and featured two new costumes. It also had the Mercenaries mode unlocked at the main menu from the start.Dreamcast: Often considered the best version of the game. It features high resolution character models and backgrounds. The cutscenes are in high resolution. Like the PC version, the player is able to play Mercenaries mode immediately and also pick Jill's costumes immediately. Like Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: CODE: Veronica on Dreamcast, the VMU displays the character's health.GameCube: Technically, the game is a port of the PlayStation version, which doesn't have any content unlocked from the start. It does, however, have the high resolution character models and backgrounds like the Dreamcast version.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack for Resident Evil 3: Nemesis was released in September 22th, 2009 in Japan. Later, versions for Europe and USA were also released. The original album is entitled Resident Evil 3: Last Escape Original Soundtrack.

                "title_clean": "Rez",
                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rez is an on-rails shooter with a behind-the-back perspective that calls to mind similar games, like  Panzer Dragoon or  Space Harrier. The game is notable for its artistic style and an amalgamation of audio, visuals, and user input, inspired by a neurological effect known as synesthesia. The game draws inspiration from the work of Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter who also considered synesthesia in his works. Presumably, this is where Rez's prototype name, \"K-Project\" came from.Sensory OverloadThe visual style of Rez is another very unique aspect. The game has a vector-stylized look to it, but as you progress, the enemies and environments grow in complexity and motion. A level may start as a simple flat plane wireframe, but eventually by the 10th layer be a cyber-rendering of the Taj Mahal. All of the environments move and fluctuate with the beat, adding to the synaesthesic effect of the game.The game was originally published by  Sega and developed by  United Game Artists, the internal Sega team headed up by  Tetsuya Mizuguchi, for the  Dreamcast and  PlayStation 2. In early 2008, Mizuguchi's new company,  Q Entertainment, was responsible for bringing Rez to the  Xbox 360 under the name  Rez HD. Rez HD employs 5.1 surround sound, in addition to 720p rendering and 4x anti-aliasing, giving the game a previous unachieved audio/visual fidelity. It was unanimously hailed by critics as a massive improvement for a game of this nature.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Epileptic DynamiteThe story is that of an  AI that governs the world's networks, known as  Eden. The AI perpetually gathers up all the knowledge in the world, until one day, becoming self-aware, shuts herself down, crippling the outside world. The player plays as a nameless hacker, attempting to break through her self-imposed firewalls and reboot the system. Each level represents an ancient society, be it Greece, Egypt, or Mesopotamia. The final level, Area 5, is the story of evolution of life, told through small text blurbs in between each segment.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay in Rez involves moving an on-screen reticle over targets and locking-on to them by holding down the fire button. When the button is released, up to eight homing shots can be released to eliminate enemies. The player also has a limited number of smart bombs that turns on automatic fire to eliminate most nearby enemies for a brief period of time. However, what sets this game apart from all others of its ilk is that with every lock on, every shot fired, and every missile deployed, a sound is made that is tonally aligned with the music and synched up with the beat. In addition to the enemies all having these attributes, this creates the effect of the user essentially improvising the song as they play. Each level contains 10 \"layers\", each with an evolved version of the music, so the songs build up in a crescendo, always climaxing with the boss fights. Every action you make in this game, whether it be shooting an enemy, picking up a power-up, or simply even progressing to the next stage, has an aural component to it, which, when taken together with the background music and visual spectacle, creates a very unique pseudo-rhythm-game feel.[CR]Scoring System[CR]Scoring in Rez centers entirely around multipliers based on the number of lock-ons a player has. For example, firing single shots nets no multiplier, while locking on to four objects nets a 4x multiplier. Higher level players memorize enemy patterns and try to get 8x multipliers as frequently as possible, as well as figure out tricks to milk the bosses for as many lock-ons as possible.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The in-game soundtrack contains edited versions of various electronic music compositions. The game takes elements from the compositions and creates a dynamic music soundtrack by mapping certain musical elements to various parts of the on-screen action. The songs were later released in their original form on the official soundtrack, entitled \"Rez: Gamer's Guide To...\", released on CD and 12\" formats.Songs:[Area 01] Keiichi Sugiyama - Buggy Running Beeps Digital Athletics [Area 02] Mist - Protocol Rain[Area 03] Ken Ishii - Creation State of the Art (Parts 1-6)[Area 04] Joujouka - Rock Is Sponge[Area 05] Adam Freeland - FearColdcut & Tim Bran - Boss AttacksEbz - Fg GsOctaeder - OvalCreative State - Ken IshiiP Project - Oval[CR]Beyond Mode[CR]Beyond mode is a set of additional challenges, bonus stages, and modes unlocked after getting 100% analysis in all five areas.Direct AssaultPlay all of the levels of Rez's normal play mode back to back.

It is a perpetual loop of atonal noise & ambience, and psychadelic visuals.Boss RushYou play all 5 bosses in order.Beyond OptionsPlayer SelectBeam TypeCamera ViewImmortalOverdrive Infinity [CR]Rez HD[CR]Rez HD is an enhanced port of  Rez, released through Xbox Live Arcade on January 30th 2008. The game was first announced by  Tetsuya Mizuguchi in September 2007, at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan. The port was handled by HexaDrive. Although fundamentally the same game there are a few differences between the  Xbox 360 and  Dreamcast version of Rez. The  HD version includes all additional content added to the  PS2 version, as well as supporting  HD resolutions and a 16:9 mode. It also added standard  Xbox Live features such as  achievements and  leaderboards. However, unlike the PS2 version the game does not support the  Trance Vibrator USB device. Instead up to 4 controllers can be connected to the 360 at any one time, and their built in rumble used to pulsate to the beat of the music. [CR]Spiritual Successor[CR] Q Entertainment's  Tetsuya Mizuguchi performed an on-stage, controller-free, demo of  Child of Eden at  Ubisoft's E3 2010 press briefing, using the new Microsoft  Kinect accessory. In both visual style and choice of music they are very similar, a couple of major differences being the motion control scheme and the first person perspective.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Developed in 1996 between Red Company and Sega, Sakura Taisen is the first entry in the now-iconic dating sim/strategy RPG franchise. The game's development was lead by Ouji Hiroi, who had previously directed the immensely popular Tengai Makyou series, and featured character designs by Kousuke Fujishima, famous for his work on several Tales games and the Oh My Goddess! manga.Sakura Taisen was originally released on the Sega Saturn in Japan on September 27, 1996 and was a huge success; selling out the day it hit the market. With the game's amazing sales several spin-off titles were released and the story was adopted into an anime as well as a series of stage plays. A sequel soon followed with the release of Kimi, Shinitamou koto Nakare in 1998 and the original game was later ported to other systems by M2.A remake of Sakura Taisen was eventually developed for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 titled Sakura Taisen: Atsuki Chishio Ni, which featured a new 3D battle system, redone artwork, and a reworked story.[CR]Setting and Story[CR]Sakura Taisen is set in alternative-historical rendition of the Japan's Taishou era (about 1923). Most technology is powered by steam, from automobiles to personal computers.In 1918 an invasion by Kouma demons devastated the Imperial Capital, Teito Tokyo. The monsters were stopped, but at great human cost. As reconstruction was finished in 1925, plans were put into place to defend the capital against further assault. An elite anti-demon unit, the Imperial Assault Troupe, would operate in secret and combat the demons, this time aided by the powerful Koubu \"Spirit Armor\" suits.Under the command of Lieutenant General Ikki Yoneda, a hero of the Kouma war and one of the surviving members of the original, unarmed anti-demon squad, the Imperial Assault Troupe would operate in secret, based under the Grand Imperial Theater in Tokyo's Ginza district. By day, the unit would be called the Imperial Acting Troupe (a wordplay on the Japanese characters for \"Assault\" and \"Act\"), and its pilots would be Japan's greatest actresses.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The story unfolds in episodic fashion, each episode beginning and ending with a \"previously..,\" and \"next on...\" eyecatch, giving the feeling of playing an anime TV series.The game operates in two modes: Adventure and Battle.In Adventure Mode, the player controls Squad Captain Ichirou Ohgami as he goes about daily activity in the theater, interacting with the characters and building social relationships with them via the LIPS system.LIPSBelieve it or not, this is a successful LIPS choice.LIPS, in essence, is a specialized style of dialog tree, one that inserts minigame-like elements into the typical \"choose an option\" interaction. At its most basic form, it is a timed dialog response. Players must choose an option before time runs out. However, letting time run out is also considered a \"valid\" option, one considered as \"no response.\" Different responses appeal to different characters, adding or subtracting invisible \"trust points,\" which eventually determine the ending of the game. BattleDefend Ueno Park!Sakura Taisen's battle mode is conducted via a turn-based, isometric-view, grid-movement system superficially similar to that found in Final Fantasy Tactics. Trust points gained or lost during the Adventure portion of the game also confer stat bonuses during that episode's battle. This system would be replaced by ARMS in the PS2 remake.During their turn, units can move and attack, defend, heal or charge spiritual energy (to use for special attacks). Unit abilities vary with each character, with some preferring ranged, area, or close-combat techniques. Ohgami, as the squad captain, has the special ability to \"cover\" a selected unit, protecting it from damage when attacked, and subsequently gaining trust points with the pilot.[CR]Main Characters (Spoiler Warning)[CR]Selected personally by General Yoneda, the girls of the Flower Division ( \"Hanagumi\"), possess vast amounts of Spirit Power and the strength of will to use it against those who would harm the peace of Tokyo. Acting by day as the country's greatest opera actresses, they would defend the citizenry by night. Squad Captain and Ticket Clipper!Ichiro OgamiBirthdate: January 3, 1903Age: 20Height: 176 cm (5'9\")Weight: 65 kgBlood Type: AAs an Ensign in the Imperial Navy, Ichirou Ogami was surprised to find his first assignment was to be under an Imperial Army General. He was surprised again, when he found that that assignment was to be \"Ticket-taker for the Grand Imperial Theater.\" He was even more surprised to discover the Imperial Acting Troupe's true nature, and his own status as the Flower Division's captain. Ogami possesses a high level of Spirit Power, a trait extremely rare in men, and required to operate a Koubu. More importantly, General Yoneda felt it was important that a male presence was needed in the Flower Division, the best to mediate between the girls' strong, sometimes conflicting personalities. Ogami would be needed to help them work in harmony, making them as strong in spirit as in battle. His white command-model Koubu uses enhanced communications equipment to coordinate squad members. In combat Ogami wields two swords in the Rou-Kou Mekkyaku (\"Wolf-Tiger Destruction\") style to eviscerate threats to the capital.The New GirlSakura ShingujiBirthdate: July 28, 1905Age: 17Height: 155 cm (5.1\")Weight: 44 kgBlood Type: ASakura is the daughter of Kazuma Shinguji, a hero of the Kouma War who sacrificed himself to save the capital. Coming to the city from her home in Sendai province, she joined the Assault Troupe to carry on her clan's - and her father's - legacy. As the \"new girl\" in the Flower Division, Sakura was at first regarded by the others (especially Sumire) as a clumsy country bumpkin unsuited to city life. Through hard work, practice, and natural talent, she's proved her worth, both as an actress and a fighter. She dislikes mice, and due to a childhood accident, is deathly afraid of thunder and lightning. Riding her pink katana-wielding Koubu, she wields the Reiken \"Arataka\" (\"Spirit Sword 'Wild Falcon') in the Hokushin Ittou-ryu discipline (\"North Star Sword Style\"). Her namesake is the Cherry Blossom (\"Sakura\").Sumire is actually younger then SakuraSumire KanzakiBirthdate: January 8, 1907Age: 16Height: 161 cm (5'3\")Weight: 50 kgBlood Type: BHeiress to the massive Kanzaki Heavy Industries conglomerate, Sumire was one of the first test pilots for the prototype Spirit Armor (then called the Oubu). She is the self-proclaimed \"Top Star\" of the Imperial Acting Troupe. Conceited and imperious, Sumire is the classic diva. Addressing him only as \"Ensign,\" she orders Ogami around like a slave. She is, in truth, affectionate and insightful, and passionate about life, both as an actress and as a soldier. She can't stand spiders. Her violet Koubu gracefully swings a Naginata, exhibiting the elegance of the Kanzaki Fujin-ryu style (\"Kanzaki Wind-God Style\"). Her floral namesake is the Violet (\"Sumire\").I don't speak Russian!Maria TachibanaBirthdate: June 19, 1903Age: 19Height: 186 cm (6'1\")Weight: 65 kgBlood Type: OBorn to a Japanese diplomat, Maria was orphaned during the Russian Revolution, eventually joining the revolutionary forces. Traumatized by the loss of her squad captain, she shut out her emotions, becoming a merciless sniper and earning the nickname \"Kazuar\" (\"Fire-eating Bird\"). She later moved to America, finding work as a Mafia enforcer before being scouted out and recruited by the Troupe's vice-commander, Ayame Fujieda. Prior to Ensign Ogami's arrival, Maria served as the Squad Captain. Though she initially refused to accept him as her commanding officer, she came to trust him as he proved himself in battle. Maria is a peerless sharpshooter, and rarely leaves home without her customized Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver pistol. Her black Koubu unit is equipped with gatling guns and sniper cannons, making it deadly at long range. Maria's height, commanding presence and deep voice often lead to her playing male characters onstage, though she occasionally fantasizes about taking more feminine roles and cooking. Maria is named after the Orange Blossom (\" Tachibana\").Koi Koi!Kohran LiBirthdate: March 3, 1906Age: 17Height: 156 cm (5'1\")Weight: 42 kgBlood Type: BLosing her home and family in the chaos of the Chinese Revolution, Kohran was raised by a family in southern Japan. Her cheerful nature and happy-go-lucky attitude is emphasized by her folksy Kansai accent. Kohran is an avid inventor and believes that machines and technology should be used to spread happiness and help people. She often gives her creations the \"Mr.\" appellation, such as \"Mr. Freezy\" for an air conditioner. Unfortunately, they have the tendency to backfire or explode, leaving Ogami to clean up the wreckage. In combat, Kohran's green Koubu provides powerful supporting fire from mounted rocket artillery launchers, as well as using all sorts of unusual weapons, such as remote mini-robots and Mahjong-tile guided missiles. Kohran is named for the Crimson Orchid (\"Kohran\") and Japanese Plum Blossom (Chinese \"Ri\", Japanese \"Sumomo\").Waai Waai!Iris ChateaubriandBirthdate: July 5, 1913Age: 9Height: 106 cm (3'6\")Weight: 18 kgBlood Type: ABThe youngest member of the Flower Divison, Iris is a powerful psychic. Born into an aristocratic family of Champagne, France, she had great difficulty controlling her powers, and for her own (and others') safety was forced to live in isolation, her only company being a teddy bear named Jean-Paul. She joined the Troupe in Japan at Vice-commander Fujieda's request. She acts onstage alongside the rest of the Flower Division, playing childrens' or young girls' roles. Cute and expressive, she addresses Ogami as \"Big Brother\". Piloting her yellow-gold Koubu, Iris is capable of teleportation, telepathy and telekinesis, as well as repairing the team's battle damage. Outside of battle, she occasionally works with the Troupe's other divisions to enact powerful psychic rituals. Her floral namesake is the Iris.\"Snakes, why did it have to be snakes\"Kanna KirishimaBirthdate: September 7, 1903Age: 19Height: 197 cm (6'6\")Weight: 78 kgBlood Type: BKanna hails from Okinawa, a chain of southern Japanese islands long famous for its inhabitants' idiosyncratic ways. Her macho, tomboyish personality often clashes with Sumire's, leading them to bicker constantly despite their close friendship. Kanna calls Sumire a \" Cactus-Woman,\" while Sumire likens her to a monkey. Like Maria, she often plays male roles, and played as Son Goku in the Troupe's rendition of \"Journey to the West.\" She hates snakes. Kanna is a master of Ryu-Ku karate, a powerful discipline which enables her to take on bears and bulls barehanded. Her highly mobile red Koubu, equipped with specially hardened knuckle weapons, engages foes in close quarters, pummeling them with powerful kicks and punches. Her floral namesakes are drawn from the Canna Lily (\"Kanna\") and the Paulownia tree (\"Kiri\").[CR]Supporting Characters (Spoiler Warning)[CR]Liquid Breakfast? Yes please!Lieutenant General Ikki YonedaGeneral Yoneda is a true war hero, once leading the original, unarmored Anti-Demon unit during the 1918 Kouma war. Wielding his sword Shintou \"Mekkyaku\" (\"Divine Sword 'Destruction'\") he fought against the Kouma demons alongside Sakura Shinguji's father Kazuma. Yoneda commands the Imperial Assault Troupe, acting as the Grand Imperial Theater's manager during tranquil times. While on the surface he appears at first to be a laid-back drunkard, he views all the girls of the Troupe as his daughters. At the same time, he punishes himself, for no father would choose to send his children out to fight.A bombshell, in and out of uniform.Vice-Commander Ayame FujiedaLike General Yoneda, Ayame Fujieda once fought in the original Anti-Demon unit. Her sword was the Shinken \"Shirahadori\" (\"Holy Sword 'Strike Halter'\"). She held feelings for another member of the unit, Shinnosuke Yamazaki, but was left alone after he disappeared following the war. As the Troupe's XO, she coordinates between the various branches of the Troupe, including the Flower Division. In battle she commands the combat airship Shogei-Maru, and is the direct liaison between the Flower Division and the upper echelons of command. Outside of combat, she serves as a producer for the Flower Division's various plays. Though somewhat distant and reserved, she has many male fans.Yuri, Kasumi, Tsubaki (left to right)The Wind DivisionThe members of the Wind Division act as the Flower Division's support staff, piloting the group's various combat transports and relaying orders and information between the squad and the Troupe at large. They deploy the high-speed \"Rolling Thunder\" ( \"Gourai-Go\") transport train, as well as the Shogei-Maru itself.There are three members of the Wind Division, who all staff the theater when off-duty:Kasumi Fujii - She leads the Wind Division, and runs the theater's administration office.Yuri Sakakibara - Yuri is the senior usher, and sees to the audience's needs during plays.Tsubaki Nonomura - Tsubaki is the cashier at the theater's gift shop and concession counter.[CR]",

Coquelicot is in many respects the polar opposite of Iris, the little girl from the previous two games. Iris is stereotypically feminine, girly and prone to emotional explosions.

                "plot": "Samba de Amigo was released in Japanese arcades in December 1999, developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. The game was ported to the Sega Dreamcast the next year, making its way to the United States. The Dreamcast version came bundled with two maraca controllers, where the goal was matching a series of patterns on screen.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Samba de Amigo was played by shaking the pair of maraca controllers to the beat of the music by shaking them high, middle, or low heights and occasionally, striking a pose. On screen, along with the notes, players see Amigo, the monkey protagonist of the game. If the player played well, more people would appear on screen as the audience. However, if the player played badly, the people would slowly disappear leaving Amigo all alone.Each player has six spots arranged in a circle on the screen. Two red spots means shake high. Two yellow spots means shake middle. And two green spots means shake low. Blue spots would move toward these red, yellow and green spots and when the blue spot met other spots the player must then shake high/middle/low to get a \"Amigo\" bonus. Also, a long line of notes occasionally appear with the word \"Shake!\", the player then must shake the maracas rapidly in that spot. Finally, players would occasionally have to copy the pose of another character that would sometimes appear on the screen, named Pose.The original arcade version simply featured three stages with three songs to pick from in each stage. If the player does well, a Special Stage would appear with three more songs. The Dreamcast version maintained that game mode while also adding Original Mode, which is the same as the Arcade mode but the player is able to choose any song they want. Another new mode in the Dreamcast version was Party Mode, which is a series of minigames. Party Mode featured Guacamole (whack-a-mole), Strike a Pose ( a long sequence of poses) and 1-2 Samba! (where spots would have be hit in sequence). Party Mode also featured Battle and Couples games. Battle would have players trying to score more points than the other player in order to eliminate him and win the stage. Couples was the opposite of this with players playing the stage cooperatively in order to score the most points. Finally, there was Challenge Mode where the players were given a goal other than just completing the song. The mode featured 25 challenges.

The game was eventually announced for release in the United States as Samba de Amigo: Ver. 2001, though it was canceled when Sega stopped supporting the Dreamcast. Ver. 2000 featured 14 new songs and 6 new downloadable songs. While instead of the three songs per stage in the original, Ver. 200 allowed the player to choose several. The Couples version from the original Dreamcast version was now included in the arcade version.Ver. 2000 also introduce a new character, Amiga, who is Amigo's sister and plays a tambourine. Instead of the minigames in Party Mode from the original game, they were all replaced with a volleyball game. A new Survival Mode was also added, in which the player must complete as many songs in a row as possible.There was also new challenges added to the Challenge Mode, as well as 5 new secret stages.Finally, Ver. 2000's biggest addition was Hustle Mode. At first, Hustle Mode seems to be the same as the Original Mode. However, the main catch of Hustle Mode is that posing is more important than hitting notes. The player must do these poses while also shaking the maracas while holding the pose, as well as sometimes have to do a complete 360 degree rotation. Every song in the game featured an Original and Hustle version, adding a new dimension to the game.

The game featured the same arcade physics, spectacular crashes, and over-the-top jumps as the first two games, with a few tweaks.  The game severely curtailed the number of listed statistics for each car from the large number present in L.A. Rush.  Gone were the dubiously significant \"Torque\" and \"Drift\" bars, replaced more the more user-friendly \"Top Speed\", \"Acceleration\", \"Cornering\" and \"Traction\".  Graphically, the game took significant steps forward from L.A. especially in the vehicle models, which featured richer textures and higher polygon counts.  2049 brought back the Stunt mode introduced in L.A. Rush.  Players still spent most of their time driving toward ramps in hopes of achieving some point-worthy result, but the introduction of wings into the game gave racers the control over their landings.  Along with the goal of achieving high scores for various stunts and flips, tokens could be collected in the stunt mode which unlocked various upgrades and new vehicles.  2049 was also released as a top-down racer for the game boy color.[CR]",

Players must also attempt to keep Seaman alive and well by interacting with the environment in various ways.The game was originally released for the Sega Dreamcast. A PlayStation 2 version of the game was released in 2001 exclusively in Japan. Seaman's designer, Yoot Saito, announced a PC version of the game, but this was eventually canceled.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Seaman is played using the Dreamcast's microphone peripheral, which plugs in the top expansion port of the Dreamcast controller. Most of the gameplay consists of Seaman asking the player a series of questions, to which the player responds with mostly one-word answers. Topics range from the player's personal life to science and politics. The game is not meant to be played for long periods of time, as Seaman with often become \"bored\" or \"tired\" from speaking with the player. In these instances Seaman will typically tell the player to \"go away\".Aside from talking, Seaman requires a few other activities of the player. Seaman's tank must be properly heated and oxygenated to keep Seaman alive and happy. There is also another tank in which the player must raise and care for larvae which grow around a plant. This tank must be kept moist so that the plant can grow and provide fresh leaves for the larva to eat. The larva eventually grow into moths. The moths then lay eggs which in turn hatch into new larvae. These larvae are Seaman's primary food source.[CR]Technology and Reception[CR]At the time of its release there was much hype surrounding Seaman's voice-recognition technology. Already a commercial hit in Japan, many in the West expected to have conversations with the Seaman artificial intelligence. In reality, Seaman could only understand simple predetermined words and phrases. While some players enjoyed the experience, others felt the gameplay was too limited and the voice-recognition was too clunky.[CR]",

Both city and locations are affected by the time of day and will feature different graphics during morning, twilight or night, as well as affecting stores and other locations which may be open or closed at the decided time. The map features 29 locations in total, some of which can be further explored from the inside. Your actions cost time and clock progresses whenever you do something or go someplace.

His objective is to stop Legion, a demon from Deadside (where all dead souls go). A demon who asked a serial killer in the 1800 to design a castle in Deadside called Asylum, a place where all killers, thieves, rapists and evil souls could reside. Legion intends to use this structure to build his armies and invade Liveside, the land of the living.In order for Legion to get this serial killer to help, he had to convince him to commit suicide so he could follow him to Deadside. The game takes place in 1999. Many years after the first serial killer was recruited by Legion. By this time, 4 more serial killers have been recruited, and are know as The Five. The Five are Milton Pike, Marco Cruz, Avery Marx, John G. Pierce/Jack The Ripper (who was the architect of Asylum), and Victor Batrachian, who is acting as the leader of The five.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As Shadow Man, players can travel between Liveside and Deadside. They do so obviously by using a teddy bear as a medium that connects Michael LeRoi to his little brother's dead soul that, of course, is in Deadside. Later on in the game players can use the teddy bear to teleport to places they have already been.The game has LeRoi explore different worlds in search of 120 dark souls. These are needed by Legion to create an immortal army, thus, Shadow Man's objective becomes to get them before Legion does and to stop his plan of invading Liveside, eliminating The Five in the process. As players gain more souls, LeRoi becomes more powerful and can access new areas, meaning the game requires players to do some backtracking.Shadow Man faces different monsters throughout the game and in order defeat them, players will have to make use different weapons. Normal weapons from Liveside like shotguns and handguns, and Deadside weapons like the Shadowgun.Other than different weapons and items, LeRoi also finds reports about the serial killers and other game related events that expand the story beyond what you see in the cutscences. These can then accessed from the item menu.Shadow Man gives players the option to face The Five in any order they want and allows them to go the different worlds (if the players has enough souls) in any order without affecting the story.A Playstation 2 exclusive sequel called Shadow Man: 2econd Coming was released in 2002.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shenmue is an adventure game set in Yokosuka, Japan. It was developed by Yu Suzuki and first released in 1999. The game was praised at the time for its unusual level of interactivity and freedom, for which Suzuki coin the term \"FREE\"; standing for Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment, and also for the inclusion of the QTE (Quick Time Events) portions that are essential to the gameplay. The game was followed by a Dreamcast sequel released in 2001 only in Europe and Japan, and was later ported to the Xbox in 2002 for all territories.In an early preview, the February 1999 issue of Computer and Video Games magazine praised the game's FREE concept, stating that Shenmue is \"the first go-anywhere, do-anything game that players had dreamed about since the dawn of video games.\"[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins with Ryo Hazuki returning to his family Dojo only to discover his father, Iwao Hazuki, fighting with a mysterious man (whose name is later revealed to be Lan Di), who demands that he hand over an object called the \"Dragon Mirror\". Ryo attempts to intervene during the fight but is easily struck down by Lan Di. He then takes this opportunity to get the information he wants and lifts Ryo off the ground, threatening to kill him if his father does not reveal the location of the mirror.Seeing his son in danger prompts Iwao to yield and he reveals that the mirror is buried underneath the Cherry Blossom tree.As Lan Di's henchmen retrieve the mirror outside, he questions Iwao if he knows of a man named \"Sunming Zhao\" and then promptly finishes off Iwao. Lan Di then departs with the Dragon mirror in hand, leaving Ryo to grieve for his father's death.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game play in Shenmue is fairly diverse; most of the game has you walking around Japanese locations in a third-person perspective (talking to various people, looking for clues, solving puzzles, etc.) along with several mini-games including a motorcycle chase, driving a forklift, multiple QTE situations, full versions of classic Sega arcade games and fighting sequences.Free QuestScreenshot of Shenmue.The majority of the game is spent in the Free Quest gameplay mode with Ryo exploring the city and looking for leads that will progress the story further. These important clues will often come from talking to the local people of Yokosuka. If the player desires, they may explore the immensely detailed city of Yokosuka without progressing through the story. There are several activities and events to be found throughout the game that don't impact the game's narrative.Free BattleFree Battle pits Ryo against one or several enemies in a style similar to fighting games and beat 'em ups. Ryo's fighting style (Hazuki Style) is heavily influenced by Virtua Fighter's Akira Yuki (a game also developed by Yu Suzuki) and utilizes many of the moves from Hakkyoku-Ken. Throughout the game, Ryo has many opportunities to add new moves to his arsenal, either through scrolls bought in stores or learning them from various people he encounters around the city.QTEThe QTE mode is a context sensitive event in the game where the gamer must press the button or direction on the D-pad in a short window of time when prompted. If missed, it will either be game over or the player might be given a second chance with an alternative button. Ryo may also be knocked out and the game would continue on. QTE scenes occur often within the game and are all pre-mapped, meaning that they are not randomized.[CR]Historical Analysis[CR]Shenmue Saturn title screenIn 1993, AM2 made another huge success in the arcades and the home video game market with the first 3D fighting game ever conceived (keep in mind that 4-D Boxing is the first 3D boxing game, not fighting game). This game raised the graphical and technical standards of gaming during this time. This arcade success is known as Virtua Fighter. Following the release of the 1993 arcade classic, Yu Suzuki pondered the idea of an action role playing adventure featuring the characters as well as the storyline from the Virtua Fighter universe. Thus, this is the definitive genesis of the Virtua Fighter Role Playing Game, or VFRPG for short.Early visual concept for Ryo Hazuki.The story\u2019s main character was originally intended to be Akira Yuki of Virtua Fighter fame and the antagonist of the game was to be Lao Chan. In the early phases of production the project was given the more specific working title of \u201cAkira\u2019s Quest\u201d. The aspects of this Virtua Fighter inspired by a very ambitious concept that called for a free open world filled with lush environments, true to life characters, a wide range of game play elements, a story that evokes emotion, themes that are universal across all of humanity, spoken dialogue done by professional voice actors, motion captured animations for all characters, in engine cut scenes, the proper use of camera cinematography, all done with more interactivity than that has been required by standard or expected in a game of its time. Meeting every standard AM2 placed on itself was at the heart of the Akira\u2019s Quest project. This hefty list of elements would later make the criteria of Yu Suzuki\u2019s new game genre of which Akira\u2019s Quest and, eventually, Shenmue would a part of. This would ultimately set the wheels in motion for what later became the AM2 effort to create the game that could possibly have saved the Sega Saturn.From Virtua Fighter Role Playing Game to ShenmueThe environments in Shenmue were ambitious, even in the Saturn version.It is undeniable that Shenmue underwent countless revisions in order to transcend its humble beginnings as the VFPRG idea at its inception. Before Shenmue was in process of being developed for the Sega Saturn, the game\u2019s story and characters saw large revisions. The universal revision made to the project was that it would longer have anything to do with the Virtua Fighter universe. This meant that the game would no longer revolve around Akira Yuki or any of other characters of the series for that matter. That is not to say that the ambitious mold of the Virtua Fighter Role Playing Game was not filled. Yu Suzuki and the AM2 team maintained their vision of this game being of the FREE genre. The VFRPG inspirations remained in the project in spirit. The fighting mechanics and engine served as the very things that would always remain with the project. The aspects of the project that remained were all the various game play elements, the some aspects of major characters\u2019 appearances, and the other aspects of the FREE concept.In terms of the character changes, Akira Yuki was replaced by Ryo Hazuki and Lao Chan was pushed aside and replaced by Lan Di. Even though their names and appearances are different, one can still see faint resemblances to their Virtual Fighter counterparts. For instance, Akira at the end of Virtua Fighter 2 is seen with short spiky hair and wearing jeans, sneakers, a white t-shirt, two red wrist bands, while carrying a backpack over his shoulder. In the Saturn version of Shenmue, Ryo Hazuki was the lead protagonist and does not have the same facial appearance as Ryo Hazuki in the Dreamcast release of Shenmue. However, he has the same hair, jeans, sneakers, and t-shirt as Akira Yuki. Ryo has one wrist band on and it looks identical to the wrist bands that Akira wore at the end of Virtua fighter 2. Lan Di looks very much like Lao Chan with the exception that Lan Di has no facial hair. Even when looking each character\u2019s fighting style similarities can easily be seen between Ryo and Akira. Lao Chan and Lan Di share the same martial arts style known as the Tiger Swallow Fist. There are other instances where similar looking characters have replaced their Virtua Fighter contemporaries, but they are not as telling as the connections between Ryo to Akira and Lao to Lan.These pieces of evidence prove just how closely related both franchises are. The other revision concerning the story reveals the tale of a certain Ryo Hazuki, the son of a martial arts teacher and part of a very traditional Japanese family. His quest involves hunting down the dangerous Lan Di, the man responsible for killing Ryo\u2019s father in front of him. Ryo intends to kill his father\u2019s murderer and avenge his father\u2019s death.The Overlapping Time Line TheoryDemonstrating the fighting engine of the game.For reasons mentioned before, it is a sure fact that Shenmue the game was essentially derived from the Virtua Fighter games (specifically Virtua Fighter 2). Even at some point early in creation it was to be of the same universe, but later in the development process AM2 decided to make a new fiction and world for this project, though the new elements were inspired by the other titles. This much is known to be true considering the slow evolution of the main character in Shenmue. However, if one considers the fact that Shenmue is the spiritual successor of the VFRPG, it can also be said that Shenmue, in an indirect way, predates the entire Virtua Fighter series by approximately XXXX years. By overlapping the clues and using some simple arithmetic, the obvious connection between both franchises and their storylines can be further solidified.A basic fact is that both Akira Yuki and Ryo Hazuki are from . Shenmue\u2019s story starts in the year of 1986, with Ryo being 18 years of age at this point. Taking XXXX and subtracting it from XXXX leaves the fact that Ryo was born in XXXX. The same exact conclusion can be reached when focusing on the character Akira. It is crucial to understand when Virtua Fighter takes place. At this point in time Akira was the age of 25, and by subtracting XXXX from XXXX Akira\u2019s year of birth is XXXX; exactly theOne of the events in both versions of Shenmue.same year Ryo Hazuki was born. Now, moving forward in time can even further solidify the connection between Ryo and Akira. Add XXXX years to Ryo\u2019s birth year and the end result is that the year comes out to be XXXX; the same year in which the original Virtua Fighter takes place. Not only does this show the solid connection between Ryo Hazuki and Akira Yuki, but it also uncovers the time gap between Shenmue and Virtua Fighter\u2019s storyline, leaving Shenmue as being the first canonically. Lastly, this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Shenmue predates the Virtua Fighter series, and does so by seven years.The Sega Saturn Development EffortWith AM2 being one of the better development teams working for Sega, the group set their sights Sega\u2019s latest hardware venture. Previously, Sega had a little taste of 32-Bit power with the 32X hardware add-on for the 16-Bit Genesis system. Though the brief 32-Bit venture was a commercial failure, Sega\u2019s hardware research and development department was prepared to concoct a system with a solid 32-Bit processing architecture that is native to the platform. This latest platform would come into the video game market under the title Sega Saturn.One of the \"bosses\" Ryo has to face in FREE Battle Mode.The ideas and revisions mentioned in previous sections were implemented in the development of Shenmue for the Sega Saturn. Even the early beginnings of the FREE game genre were able to be seen in this project. During the year 1995, around the time the Saturn project started, quite a few games were available for the system. However, not many of them took full advantage of the system\u2019s capabilities. The Sega Saturn\u2019s internal architecture is much more than just a 32-Bit processor.The system consists of five microprocessors. one serves as the system\u2019s central processor and another one isintended for subroutines and auxiliary functions. Two are intended for graphics processing and the last remaining microprocessor was devoted toward audio functions. This is not the only way the Saturn differs from other systems of its time period. The console also uses different fundamentals for media processing and graphical rendering. Other systems of the time used three sided shapes as their 3-D geometric rendering primitives. The Sega Saturn broke the status by using tetragons as its geometric rendering primitive. This primitive makes for less texture distortion, giving the platform a technical edge over its competitors. Given that the development tools for 3-D modeling and design of the time were based off the triangle primitive and the extensive internal architecture, developing games for the Sega Saturn was very difficult. Some developers got around this obstacle by re-purposing certain microprocessors for other tasks. For example, the game Virtual Fighter uses two microprocessors just to render both fighter's models.There eventually were titles by first and third party developers alike that used the console\u2019s hardware well, but the rest of the games for the Saturn were either not developed too well or were sloppy ported versions of previously released games. AM2 had developed three popular arcade game conversions to the Sega Saturn which were the first two Virtua Fighter games as well as the enormously successful Daytona game. All three titles sold well, but did not manage to cure what ailed the Saturn in terms of having a substantial game library. Yu Suzuki\u2019s Shenmue project was supported by a large budget so it could come out and serve as the Sega Saturn\u2019s tour de force.Early screenshot of the Saturn version.This version of the game got to the final stages of development and was a short distance from a retail release. Shenmue\u2019s story and game play mechanics were fleshed out and the game was able to run on a stock standard Sega Saturn. However, the plug was pulled on the Saturn project. This was most likely due to the dying status of the platform. The Saturn was in a precarious situation with a lack of support from Electronic Arts which, at the time, was far and away the biggest and most lucrative third party publisher. Also, other multiplatform titles were favored on the Sony Playstation because they were developed for a platform that had a less advanced and leass complicated hardware. Eventually the Sega Saturn fell away and the Shenmue project was temporarily put on hiatus.[CR]",

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The gameplay style of Castle Shikigami 2 is your typical top down shoot. You have two types of regular shots and bombs.  There are also 5 levels of difficulty to choose from in the game so there will be a challenge for a long time to come. Multiplayer is the same as single player except you are both able to play through the story mode. Dialogue will also be different with each combination of character you choose.    Bullets!!!  Normal AttacksTo use the normal you can either rapidly press the square button or hold down the circle button (On the PS2 version). This will use the regular bullet attacks that is specific to your chosen character.  Mobile Light Force 3 Attack The Mobile Light Force 3 attack is used by holding down the square button. This will use a alternate attack from your regular bullets and they are usually a close range attack. The advantages of useing this attack is that coin dropped from enemies will automatically be collected but your characters speed will decrease.  Special Attack The special attack is your bomb attack. You will start off with 3 bombs every life and can hold up to a max of 5. During this attack you cannot be damaged, all enemies will be destroyed and bosses will take a large amount of damage. You will be able to regain a bomb at every 250,000,000 points. (You read that right) Tension Bonus System The Tension Bonus System works like the graze system in the     Touhou series of games.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Silent Scope is an arcade light gun shooter developed and published by Konami in 1999. The game casts the player as an elite police marksman taking part in a series of high-stakes sniper missions. The game is typical of many arcade light gun shooters; it uses mechanics such as limited time which can be extended by fast, precise shooting and penalties for damaging civilians. What sets the game apart, however, is that it is played with a large plastic sniper rifle mounted directly to the arcade cabinet. The rifle features a functional \"scope;\" the player may peer into it to afford him or herself a greatly magnified view of a small portion of the cabinet's larger screen. This scope was required for engaging enemies at the enormous distances the game presents.[CR]The Rifle[CR]The game's famous plastic sniper rifle is a replica of an actual police marksman rifle, the Heckler and Koch PSG1, which is also featured prominently in Konami's Metal Gear Solid franchise. The rifle's \"scope\" does not actually magnify the screen; it is, in fact, a smaller screen contained within the rifle itself, showing a magnified view of where the game detects the rifle to be aiming. Although the game is generally accepted to fall under the umbrella of light gun shooters, the rifle itself is not actually a light gun; rather, the position on the screen at which it is pointing is communicated to the game via the analog hard mount on which the rifle sits.[CR]Console Versions[CR]The console versions of the game made the transition largely intact, although much of the game's allure was lost without the large, unique rifle peripheral. Instead, the player aimed a zoomed-in cursor representing the scope of the protagonist's weapon.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Skies of Arcadia is a role-playing game for the Dreamcast, released in Japan on October 5, 2000 as Eternal Arcadia. In the US it was released as Skies of Arcadia on November 13, 2000. It was developed by Overworks (subsequently known as Sega WOW) and published by Sega. Skies of Arcadia: Legends was a port of the Dreamcast version and featured 24 new discoveries, a new sub-plot featuring a character named Piastol, a new bounty system that rewarded the player for defeating typically new optional bosses and a few extra weapons and items.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story centers around Vyse, a young man who wishes to travel the air as a sky pirate. His father is the captain of the pirate crew, the Blue Rogues. As the group sails through the skies, they run into a warship of the Valuan Empire attacking a young girl's ship, so they decide to take advantage of the distracted ship and raid it. Vyse and his companion Aika board the ship in search of valuables, but they run into Fina, the mysterious girl who was being attacked. They rescue her and the Blue Rogues head back to Pirate Island, their headquarters.After they land, Vyse, Aika, and Fina see a stone fall to a nearby island and decide to investigate. When they return, they find that the Valuan army has attacked their home in retribution, and have captured many of their friends and family. Now the three companions must find a way to break into the Valuan Empire, rescue their friends, and find out why Fina is so important to their enemies.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Skies of Arcadia offers fairly standard turn-based RPG combat: it has physical attacks, spells, and special attacks unique to each character. Players choose the action they will take before a turn and then watch the characters and the enemies alternate turns attacking each other. Character agility and attack choices effect the order in which the characters will take turns. The gameplay mechanic that sets this system apart from other rpg's is that there is one pool of energy that the whole party can draw upon to perform magic and special abilities. This brings a new dynamic to the fights since you have to think ahead about what moves you are going to use. Alternatively, each player can perform a focus action to add \"spirit points\" to the group and can more easily access super moves or a special crew attack when you fill up the pool. It is also important to keep your party alive as when a character is unconscious that characters \"spirit points\" are no longer added to the pool at the beginning of the players turn, limiting player options.Another aspect that this game shares with other rpg's is the idea that the enemies have weakness to certain elements. In the game you gain access to different crystals imbued with elements as you progress through the story. You are allowed to change the elements of your weapon at any time during the fight without any penalty. This allows the player to change up their strategy on the fly and gain the upper hand when fighting bosses of regular monster. When you finished fight you will get points based on the element set to your weapon at the end of the fight. The characters also get a smaller fraction of points if someone else in your party has their weapon set to a different element. This is the basic magic system of the game, each color corresponds to a certain element.Red- Fire, increase strengthGreen-Healing magic, poisonBlue- Water/Wind magic, increase speedPurple- Ice magic, can cast silence to negate special/magic attacksYellow- Lightning magic, can lower enemy defenseSilver- Life and Death magicBattles In The Sky!Skies of Arcadia also features a airship-to-airship battle system, which are a fusion on the turn based combat that is featured in Skies of Arcadia with some interesting elements borrowed from strategy rpg's. These battle are heavily dependent on planning ahead as victory is often dependent on landing multiple attacks to strike at the same time. For example, you could launch a torpedo to hit in three rounds then shoot a gun that hits for two rounds, so on the third round when you shoot your regular guns you also land the torpedoes you fired before, letting you score massive damage on your enemy.You can also customize your air ship with better weapons as well as gather crew members for your ship which will give it bonus features that can be called upon in combat. Another feature of the airship combat is the ability to perform a special attack. These special attacks can only be called upon once you get your ship into the right position as well as have enough points to perform the attack. This requires the player to out maneuver the enemy to get into position.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Airship battles have serious consequencesThese Character descriptions are based upon the Character introductions given in the Skies of Arcadia Legends manual.Vyse: Young Pirate who dreams of grasping the limits of the skies. The main character of Skies of Arcadia. A young boy of the Blue Rogues. Handles two cutlasses with both hands. Full of curiosity, and very fearless. Quote: \"One day, I shall see what lies beyond the clouds, the so-called limits of the world.\"Aika: A bright, ever-cheerful girl, who trusts and takes actions with Vyse at any time. A childhood friend of Vyse who rides on the same Pirate ship. Straightforward and frank, she will clearly say whatshe likes and what she doesn't like, but her Pirate friends admire her agility and skill with the boomerang. Quote: \"Friends and treasures, which shall I take? Why both, of course.\"Fina: A girl from a foreign world. Quiet, but with a strong will and a kind heart. A girl who, with certain events, becomes involved with Vyse and his friends. She is very quiet, but the smile she shows at times makes you feel her kind heart. She wears clothes from a foreign world, not even Vyse knows where she is from.Cupil: A mysterious creature who is always with Fina. A mysterious creature that can change its shape at will. It appears to be a friend of Fina from her childhood. Normally it is in the shape of a bracelet. But during a battle, Cupil changes its shape to a weapon, such as a sword, to attack the enemies and to protect Fina.Drachma: An old, lonesome sailor with a vendetta. An old sailor that Vyse meets during his adventure. Long ago he lost his eye and arm to a huge arcwhale called Rhaknam, and ever since he has made capturing Rhaknam his only purpose in life. His experience as a sailor is excellent and he is very skilled at his trade. But with his blunt and cantankerous, he continues to sail alone on his ship \"Little Jack.\" Quote: \"My sole purpose is to capture Rhaknam.\"There are three total characters who take up the fourth party member position in Skies of Arcadia. Drachma is the first of these and he shares this position with Gilder and Enrique. Drachma is the fourth party member for an early portion of the game, Gilder is the fourth party member for the large mid-portion of the game and the last section, and Enrique is the fourth party member for the mid-end portion of the game.Just like Enrique, Drachma's time with the group is an excuse to give the player an airship for a short period of time. Drachma freely lets Vyse and the group use their ship, although Drachma is still the captain. Drachma leaves the party early and frequently.Drachma shows up at the end of the game, just before the final boss and can rejoin the party as an optional fourth member.Little Jack: The middle size ship that Captain Drachma has sailed with for many years. The ship itself is an old model, but the armor and cannons have been strengthened to be able to battle against large battleships and, of course, Rhaknam.Gilder: Easy-going Pirate in chase of \"the good life.\" Captain of the Pirate ship \"Claudia,\" with free life as his motto. He wanders the skies in search of vast treasures, beautiful women and of course excitement. He is a light-hearted soul whose not afraid to crack jokes in the most dire of situations. But in reality, other Pirates and the Valuan forces recognize his skills as a warrior and a leader. Quote: \"Only four of us against a hundred of them, huh... Sounds like fun. Count me in!Gilder is the first \"final\" party member you get after Drachma originally leaves the group. At the time that Drachma is still in the group he lets Vyse, Fina, and Aika use his ship \"Little Jack\". Once Drachma finally leaves he leaves with his ship, as he finally found Rhaknam and he realizes that it is his life goal to capture him. Once Gilder originally joins the party he is the longest lasting member of the group, and although his first time with the group is the largest of any 4th party member, he is also gone for a large section of the mid-game as well.During the original Gilder portion of the game, before the party meets Enrique and gets the Delphinus as their core ship, the party is not in possession of an airship so they mostly deal with on land conflicts in the story. Gilder leaves shortly after the beginning of the first disc, where he gets separated from the core three in an airship crash. He reappears in the last portion of the game, being the games true and final fourth member.During the original Gilder portion of the game, before the party meets Enrique and gets the Delphinus as their core ship, the party is not in possession of an airship so they mostly deal with on land conflicts in the story. Gilder leaves shortly after the beginning of the first disc, where he gets separated from the core three in an airship crash.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]After 1994's Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic the Hedgehog sort of fell off the map. Though a number of spin-offs followed for years to come, Sonic Team moved on to other franchises like NiGHTS: into Dreams... and Burning Rangers. Five years after their last Sonic game, Sonic Team returned to the Sonic franchise for Sonic Adventure, the first all-3D Sonic game and a launch title for Sega's new Dreamcast console.Sonic in the \"Station Square\" Adventure FieldSonic Adventure re-wrote the rules in which Sonic games were traditionally played. Not entirely unlike Super Mario 64, Sonic now traveled between a number of hub worlds referred to as \"Adventure Fields\" that housed NPCs and light RPG elements. As Sonic progresses though the game, \"Action Stages\" could be accessed from various entryways in Adventure Fields. Action Stages were more traditional Sonic levels, where generally the goal was to reach the end of the level as quickly as possible. Sonic's own base set of skills had to be changed from previous title in order to more easily navigate in three dimensions, most notably with the addition of the \"homing attack\" -- which allowed Sonic to automatically strike a nearby enemy or object by performing a mid-air dash. Homing attacks can even be chained together so long as more enemies are nearby.The roster of playable characters was expanded from three characters in Sonic 3 & Knuckles to six total characters. Newcomers Big the Cat and E-102 Gamma appear along side the returning, but first-time-playable Amy Rose in addition to Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.Story in Sonic Adventure is a much heavier focus than any Sonic title before it, with each character having their own unique plot thread that would often intersect with the other six storylines. Sonic and company were given cinematic cutscenes and fully-voiced dialog to help flesh the story out even further. Upon completing all six storylines, the player gains access to a seventh and final story which ties all the stories back together in a climactic boss battle and to ultimately resolve the plot.Rather than start with a base skill set that you kept for the entire game, as you progressed in Sonic Adventure you would find upgrade items located in Adventure Fields and Action Stages that would bestow new abilities upon your character, such as Sonic's \"Light Speed Attack\", a move with a lengthy charge-up period that could be used to clear out entire groups of enemies at once.Boss encounters were less frequent than in classic Sonic titles, and rather than occurring at the end of every stage or zone in the game. would instead occur at pivotal points in the storyline. [CR]Plot, Characters, and Abilities[CR] SonicAfter finding himself in coastal town Station Square, Sonic encounters \"Chaos\", a bizarre, nearly-invincible creature made out of living water. After meeting up with Tails, the pair trace Chaos back to Dr. Eggman, who is feeding the monster Chaos Emeralds in order to increase its strength with the eventual goal of using it to conquer the world.Knowing they can't let that happen, Sonic and Tails team up to find the Chaos Emeralds before Dr. Robotnik.Gameplay: The most traditional of the characters, Sonic's gameplay largely revolves around running to the end of the stage as quickly as possible while grabbing rings and destroying robots.TailsAfter failing a test flight of a new Chaos-Emerald-powered Airplane, Tails encounters Sonic who tells him about the \"Chaos\" monster he fought. The pair eventually learn that Dr. Eggman is trying to use the monster's transformations to conquer the world. Both agree that this cannot be allowed to happen, and set off to stop him at all costs.Gameplay: All of Tails' stages are nearly identical to Sonic's, with one twist: he must race somebody else to the finish line using his flight ability to take specific shortcuts designed around it. KnucklesThe last of his people, Knuckles was entrusted to guard a massive jewel known as the Master Emerald. Centuries ago, his people misused the power of the Chaos Emeralds for greed, and the Gods created the Master Emerald to help regulate the gems unpredictable and destructive power. As the legend goes, when things eventually got out of hand, the God of Destruction arose from within the Master Emerald to punish those who wished to misuse the power of the Chaos Emeralds. One night, Knuckles awakes to find a monster before him and the Master Emerald destroyed. He sets out to find the missing pieces of the Master Emerald in order to re-assemble it and restore it to its original state. Knuckles only later discovers that Dr. Eggman has shattered the Master Emerald in order to release the God of Destruction.Gameplay: Knuckles' gameplay consists of exploring wide-open, non-linear areas using his gliding, climbing, and digging abilities. The main goal of these levels are to find three missing shards of the shattered Master Emerald, which ping on Knuckles' radar with greater frequency depending on how close he is to a given shard. Stages end when all three shards have been collected.Amy RoseAlways one step behind Sonic, Amy believes they are destined to be lovers, much to Sonic's chagrin. Upon finding her way to Station Square, she discovers a lost bird with a picture of his parents hung around his neck. As she sets off to help the bird reunite with its family, she encounters ZERO, a dangerous robot bent on capturing her and the bird.Gameplay: One of the slowest characters in the game, Amy Rose's gameplay can best be described as \"stealth-lite\". Every single one of her levels involves either running or hiding from the invincible ZERO robot. If cornered, Amy can use her piko-piko hammer to stun ZERO temporarily or destroy other enemy robots. E-102 Gamma The greatest of Dr. Eggman's E-series robots, Gamma is tasked with completing various odd jobs for his creator. After witnessing the horrible fates of his E-series robot brethren after they failed to accomplish the mission objectives issued by their evil master, Gamma begins to question his own programming.Gameplay: Gamma's feature mechanics that bare passing resemblance to shooters like Panzer Dragoon and Rez, where you move a laser crosshair around the screen in order to lock on targets and then release the fire button to take them all out in sequence. Compared to other characters, Gamma has a unique health system in that a timer is constantly counting down to his inevitable death. By shooting enemies and chaining together shot combos, time gets re-added to the clock, forcing players to constantly keep moving forward.Big the CatBig the Cat's life begins and ends with fishing in nearby streams and ponds with his best friend, Froggy. But one night, when Froggy swallows a Chaos Emerald and begins to acting strangely, Big is forced to go on a quest to find out where his friend has gone and what could be causing his strange mood swings.Gameplay: Big's levels often involve a smaller section of one level with a large body of water where the player can cast a lure and go fishing, similar to Sega Bass Fishing. The goal of each fishing challenge is to hook and retrieve Froggy, who is swimming in the waters somewhere in each level. Players can also catch other fish as well, to set high scores depending on a given fish's weight. [CR]Action Stages[CR]Aside from Hot Shelter, which is never entered by Sonic, all of the action stages for the other 5 characters are made up mostly of parts of Sonic's action stages. In this sense, Sonic Adventure has only 11 unique action stages (Sonic's 10 stages, plus Hot Shelter) although the stages can differ wildly between characters. Because of varying (and sometimes slower) gameplay styles, the other characters tend to use only a portion of Sonic's full stage, or may be required to traverse the stage in totally different directions. In addition, enemy and object placement differs for each character, and some areas (such as inside the castle in Amy's Twinkle Park) are unique to certain characters.Located in \"Station Square\"Emerald CoastCasinopolisTwinkle ParkSpeed HighwayLocated in \"Mystic Ruins\"Windy ValleyIce CapRed MountainLost WorldFinal EggLocated in \"Egg Carrier\"Sky DeckHot ShelterMini-Game StagesSky ChaseSand Hill[CR]Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions[CR]Sonic Adventure on XBLAOn June 10th, 2010, it was officially announced that Sonic Adventure would be hitting Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.This downloadable version of Sonic Adventure was based off of the PC port of Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut, released in 2004. Though some changes were made to bring it up to standards with the original release of Sonic Adventure DX, it was still missing a number of enhanced graphical effects exclusive to the Gamecube version of the game.However, this version features Achievements/Trophies, Avatar awards, and individual time trial leaderboards for many of the game's levels.Sonic Adventure was released on Xbox Live Arcade on September 15th, 2010,with a PlayStation Network release hitting five days later on September 20th, for $10 (or 800 Microsoft Points). Despite being based on the graphically enhanced release of Sonic Adventure DX, this version only contained content from the original Sonic Adventure.A week later, a supplemental DLC pack was released, adding in all of the extra content from \"Sonic Adventure DX:Director's Cut\". This included the brand new \"Mission Mode\", and the ability to unlock Metal Sonic for use in Time Trial Mode. It is,however, missing the 15 unlockable Game Gear games that were part of the original Sonic Adventure DX release. The \"Sonic Adventure DX Upgrade\" DLC was priced at $5 (or 400 Microsoft Points), making the complete Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut package cost $15 in total.The Xbox Live Arcade/PC release of Sonic Adventure was later packaged as part of the disc-based Dreamcast Collection, released in February 2011 for PC and Xbox 360.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Due to his impressive work on Sonic 3D Blast and Sonic & Knuckles, musician Jun Senoue was given a more commanding presence in Sonic Adventure's soundtrack along side other Sonic Team music artists like Fumie Kumatani, Kenichi Tokoi, Takeshi Taneda, and Yukata Minobe. Sonic Adventure contained six vocal tracks:\"It Doesn't Matter - Theme of Sonic\" by Jun Senoue and Johnny Gioeli of the band Crush 40\"Believe in Myself - Theme of Tails\" by Jun Senoue, Karen Brake, Terry Woods and Maxine Waters\"Unknown from M.E. - Theme of Knuckles\" by Atsushi Kosugi, Marlon Saunders, and John \"Dredd Fox\" Simpson III\"My Sweet Passion - Theme of Amy\" by Atsushi Kosugi and Nikki Gregoroff\"Lazy Days ~Livin' in Paradise~ - Theme of Big\" by Atsushi Kosugi and Ted Poley\"Open Your Heart - Main Theme of Sonic Adventure\" by Jun Senoue and Johnny Gioeli of the band Crush 40Additionally, after the release of Sonic Adventure, Sega published a vocal remix album, featuring the talents of bands Transmutator, Spahn Ranch, Sister Machine Gun, and Razed in Black, plus the work of Chris Vrenna, Mark Blasquez, Cevin Key, Kevin Moore, and Steve Tushar.[CR]Development History[CR]After Sonic Team's game design guru Hirokazu Yasuhara left the group and disseminated back in to Sega in 1995, the man he was training as an apprentice took his place: Takashi Iizuka. After his stint as \"Lead Game Designer\" on NiGHTS: Into Dreams..., Takashi Iizuka approached Yuji Naka with his idea for a \"Sonic the Hedgehog RPG\". Yuji Naka was impressed with the direction Iizuka wanted to take the franchise, and rumors began to circulate about a new \"Sonic & Knuckles\" game in the weeks leading up to its public unveiling in August 1998.Remember, this is a \"business trip\".During production, members of Sonic Team took a trip to Central America to gain inspiration for some of the game's locations. Many photos taken of the various Mayan Ruins they visited ended up being directly incorporated in to actual in-game textures, and characters like Tikal and Pachacamac were named after locations the team visited.When unveiled, Sonic Team and Sega held a large public event in Japan, where they debuted the first gameplay footage of the game followed by a live performance of the game's theme song, \"Open Your Heart\" by Jun Senoue. The evening was topped off by an appearance of Japanese Sega Saturn mascot Segata Sanshrio, who got the crowd to chant for Sonic's return.After the game's release in Japan, Sega and Sonic Team knew the game was not as finished as they would have liked it to be, so in the year leading up to the September 1999 release of the game they established Sonic Team USA, based out of San Francisco, in order to polish and refine the game further. The American release of Sonic Adventure was later re-released in Japan as \"Sonic Adventure: International Edition\".[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]This is the first Sonic game to use the name \"Doctor Eggman\" when referring to Robotnik. In Japan, Dr. Robotnik was always known as \"Eggman\", but his name was changed for the North American releases of the Sega Genesis Sonic games because of focus testing. The English dub of Sonic Adventure features a scene where Sonic refers to Dr. Robotnik as \"Eggman\" as a taunting nickname, unifying his name across the world. In future games, the name \"Robotnik\" is gradually phased out entirely.This is the final game Naoto Oshima (the original designer of Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman) is credited for. It is rumored he left Sonic Team after a dispute with Yuji Naka over which direction to take the Sonic franchise for Sonic Adventure 2. For unknown reasons, Naoto Oshima's name was removed from the credits in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut.Sonic Adventure was originally designed to run at 60 frames per second, but crippling amounts of slowdown meant the game had to be reduced to 30 frames per second instead. Sonic Adventure DX, the Gamecube port, attempted to restore the 60fps framerate, but even then, the framerate is known to fluctuate between 60 and 30 frames per second, and sometimes even lower, depending on what is on screen.At least one boss is known to have been cut from the game: A giant, three-headed mechanical dragon. Sonic and Tails would have faced off against it in the Sky Chase Action Stage. Remnants of this boss still exist in the game's code.When Segata Sanshiro got the crowd to chant for Sonic's return at the game's unveiling, their chants were recorded and used in-game during the game's final story where the residents chant for Sonic to defeat the game's final boss.Chaos was designed specifically to be the sort of creature that would have been impossible to render on the previous generation of hardware (fully transparent animated polygons).Some of the songs in Sonic Adventure are remastered versions of tracks Jun Senoue composed for the Sega Genesis version of Sonic 3D Blast. Specifically, the theme for the bumper car segment of Sonic Twinkle Park's action stage, and the theme for Tails's Windy Valley action stage.In the Sega Genesis Sonic games, collecting the seven Chaos Emeralds and then having 50 or more rings would transform Sonic in to Super Sonic. In Sonic Adventure, Sonic only transforms in to Super Sonic at a pivotal point in the storyline, but an unused tutorial voice clip suggests that Super Sonic was at one point meant to be playable outside of the game's final boss encounter, just like the Sega Genesis games.Elara Distler, voice actress for Tikal the Echidna, was actually the Sound Engineer's girlfriend at the time this game was produced.John \"Dredd Fox\" Simpson III, who does the rap portions of \"Unknown from M.E. - Theme of Knuckles\" is the voice actor for Sony's Parappa the Rapper.During their Central America excursion, Yuji Naka reportedly became very ill and was forced to sit most of the trip out in his hotel room.Tikal in Knuckles' Speed Highway  Though not normally selectable, both Tikal and Dr. Eggman are available in the game's code as playable characters. Neither of them have any appreciable move sets, and cannot interact with scripted level triggers. However, when playing as them, the player can access a few debug commands not normally selectable with other characters. It is possible they were meant to be playable characters at some point during development. [CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen.Two years after Sonic Adventure brought Sega's mascot back to the forefront of the company, Sonic Team released its sequel, Sonic Adventure 2. Boasting vastly improved visuals, a rock-solid 60 frames-per-second framerate, it streamlined and expanded many of the conventions introduced in the original Sonic Adventure. For example, rather than the extended charge-up time required to execute Sonic's \"Light Speed Dash\" in Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2 shortened the name to \"Light Dash\" and had it instantly accessible at the touch of a button. Rather than have Sonic's homing attack lock on to anything near him (even objects behind him), Sonic Adventure 2's homing attack requires players to point Sonic in the general direction of the object they wanted to strike. The ''adventure fields'' hub stages of Sonic Adventure were also removed entirely, putting the focus squarely on action stages just as Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Sonic The Hedgehog 3, and Sonic & Knuckles did. This formula would later be repeated in Sonic Heroes and Shadow The Hedgehog.Shadow the HedgehogCharacters new to the Sonic series were the jewel thief Rouge the Bat and revenge-obsessed Shadow the Hedgehog, whom the game's story conveys as being notoriously similar in appearance to Sonic. (In the story, multiple characters and seemingly the entire human populace mistake him for Sonic.) Returning to the roster is Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The recurring villain of the Sonic series, Doctor Eggman, of course returned, but surprisingly, in Sonic Adventure 2 he made his debut appearance as a player-controlled character. In total this brings the number of playable characters up to six, just as Sonic Adventure had six playable characters. However, rather than having six separate storylines that cross paths, Sonic Adventure 2 divides things up by teams -- the \"Hero\" team, where the good guys (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles) reside, and the \"Dark\" team, home to the bad guys (Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge). Furthermore, whereas the six characters in Sonic Adventure were each more or less unique from each other, in Sonic Adventure 2, each character play style and abilities are for all intents and purposes completely identical to that character's rival. (This is most likely to keep the 2-player versus mode fair.) In this sense, Sonic Adventure 2 has only 3 unique characters, Sonic/Shadow being one, Knuckles/Rouge being another, and Tails/Eggman being the third.Therefore, Sonic Adventure 2 contains only three gameplay types - (not counting the driving stages, of which there are only two) - fueling the \"Rivals\" aspect of the game. Sonic and Shadow are \"Speed\" type characters, and the majority of their levels are high-speed action platforming stages. Tails and Eggman, both piloting mechanized walking armor, are \"Shooting\" type characters, and are essentially Sonic Adventure 2's version of E-102 Gamma's gameplay from the first Sonic Adventure. Finally, Knuckles and Rouge are \"Hunting\" characters, in a reprisal of Knuckles' emerald-hunting gameplay from the first Sonic Adventure, in which the player must rely on a hot-and-cold radar system that alerts you whenever an emerald shard is nearby, and changes color as the distance between you and the emerald increases or decreases.Sonic in 'City Escape!'Not present in Sonic Adventure 2 are the free-roaming \"Adventure Field\" hub worlds from Sonic Adventure. Instead, the game falls back on the traditional linear progression and gameplay-only focus of the classic Sega Genesis Sonic titles. This also gives the narrative a fast-paced feel while it follows multiple ongoing events at once. Cutscenes often bookend levels and boss encounters, and the story frequently jumps around from character to character; in one level you may play as Sonic as he zips through a dense jungle, whereas in the next level you will play as Knuckles as he hunts for emerald pieces in haunted mountains.Proper multiplayer gameplay finally makes a return to the franchise after nearly 7 years of absence, playing off of the rivals aspect: Two players can play race each other to the end goal in each stage as Sonic and Shadow, race each other to find three Emerald Shards as Knuckles and Rouge, and as Tails and Eggman, in their robot walkers, shoot it out in one of several small arenas, with the objective being to deplete the other's life bar.After finishing the game, the player can re-visit any story event in the game via a DVD-style scene selection menu, or play any of the stages themselves by choosing one in the stage select mode. The player is also challenged to earn A-ranks on each stage by performing well in them. Each stage has 4 additional missions in addition to the default one, with each mission having its own A rank threshold to achieve by getting a good enough time or score.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The plot begins with Doctor Eggman infiltrating a military base which had since 50 years prior been hiding his grandfather's greatest invention, Project Shadow. Eggman doesn't know the full details of Project Shadow, but expects it to be some sort of weapon. What he finds instead is a black hedgehog, claiming his name is Shadow. Now free, Shadow promises to lend Doctor Eggman his aid - but that Eggman must first meet Shadow on the Space Colony ARK.''I'm outta here!''A week later, Sonic the Hedgehog finds himself on the run from the Military Organization, G.U.N (Guardian Unit of Nations), who have suddenly claimed that Sonic is a dangerous criminal. Unaware of what is going on, Sonic escapes and attempts to avoid capture when he encounters Shadow the Hedgehog, who is in the middle of stealing a Chaos Emerald. Putting two and two together, Sonic assumes the Military is mistaking Shadow for Sonic (and vice-versa), and that this \"fake\" Hedgehog is the reason Sonic is in so much trouble. Before Sonic can engage Shadow in battle, however, Shadow vanishes in to thin air using a power called \"Chaos Control\", leaving Sonic confused and quickly surrounded by dozens of fully-armed G.U.N soldiers.Once again captured, Sonic is later freed from a prison cell by Amy Rose. Them together with Tails and Knuckles, they attempt to seek out Dr. Eggman and Shadow the Hedgehog in a race against time, while evading the military.Rouge's ReportAfter Sonic Adventure 2 hit retail, SonicTeam published the Official Sonic Adventure 2 Strategy Guide in Japan, which contained \"The Last Report on Project Shadow\", written by the in-game character Rouge the Bat, in an effort to uncover the mystery of who - or what Shadow is, and where he came from. A summary of the report follows:50 years ago, the current President of Nations contracted Professor Gerald Robotnik to research the feasability of immortality. Gerald initially refused to be involved, comparing it to to playing God. But when his niece, Maria Robotnik, contracted the terminal disease NIDS (Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome), Gerald reconsidered the project in the hopes that he could find a cure and save her life. The classified \"Project Shadow\" was launched on the Space Colony ARK where Gerald's science team would not be disturbed, and there they began researching the mysteries of the Chaos Emeralds and how they effected living tissue.One experiment, designed to accelerate the rate of cell regeneration seen in some species of lizards, turned disastrous - the \"Biolizard\" subject grew ten times its normal size and became violent, killing several scientists before being contained. When the Military Organization G.U.N learned of this incident, they sprung in to action in order to shut down Project Shadow (violently, if necessary) before any further lives were lost. When they arrived aboard the ARK, Professor Gerald was already putting the finishing touches on what he called the \"Ultimate Life-form\": an immortal black hedgehog that could harness the energies of the Chaos Emeralds, named after the project he was born from - Shadow. Not knowing what the military would do with a creature like Shadow, Gerald entrusted Maria to take him to an escape pod and head down to the planet below where they would be safe.They were intercepted by G.U.N soldiers, who, in an effort to kill Shadow, accidentally shot Maria instead. With her last dying breath, she sealed Shadow in the escape pod and ejected him to earth. When Professor Gerald heard the news of his niece's death, he flew in to rage and despair; the very project he wanted to use to save her life ended up being the instrument of her demise. Before being captured by G.U.N and sentenced to death for the Biolizard incident on the Space Colony ARK, Professor Gerald gave Shadow strict instructions to carry out revenge for what happened to Maria. But, before that could happen, G.U.N imprisoned Shadow in suspended animation to ensure that the truth about what happened on the ARK was never revealed.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Below is a list of the stages in the game, listed in the order which they are played in the story mode.Hero Story:SONIC: City EscapeKNUCKLES: Wild CanyonTAILS: Prison LaneSONIC: Metal HarborSONIC: Green ForestKNUCKLES: Pumpkin HillTAILS: Mission StreetKNUCKLES: Aquatic Mine[ Driving Stage ]: Route 101TAILS: Hidden BaseSONIC: Pyramid CaveKNUCKLES: Death ChamberTAILS: Eternal EngineKNUCKLES: Meteor HerdSONIC: Crazy GadgetSONIC: Final RushDark Story:EGGMAN: Iron GateROUGE: Dry LagoonEGGMAN: Sand OceanSHADOW: Radical HighwayROUGE: Egg QuartersEGGMAN: Lost ColonyEGGMAN: Weapons BedROUGE: Security HallSHADOW: White Jungle[ Driving Stage ]: Route 280SHADOW: Sky RailROUGE: Mad SpaceEGGMAN: Cosmic WallSHADOW: Final ChaseLast Story:ALL: Cannon's CoreUnlockable:SONIC: Green Hill Zone[CR]Soundtrack Albums[CR]''Sonic Adventure 2 Multi-Dimensional Soundtrack''Front CoverBack CoverAn official 2-disc soundtrack was released, containing almost all of the music from Sonic Adventure 2.

Taking inspiration from their Southern California location, Sonic Team decided to set SA2 in the fictional \"Central City\", featuring their own takes on San Francisco landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and more.Throughout its development cycle, Sonic Adventure 2 changed rather dramatically. Early media and interviews with Yuji Naka point to there only being three playable characters initially: Sonic, Knuckles, and Eggman. After outcry from gamers wondering where certain franchise-staple characters were, Tails, Shadow, and Rouge were revealed to be playable. The fact that Tails, Shadow, and Rouge were possibly added to the roster later in development may help explain why over half the levels in the game recycle assets from other stages.Other early preview material point to the game at one point having branching storyline pathways; one example given of this in effect was a scenario involving Sonic trapped, underwater, in a submarine. The player would be given one of two options: Make Sonic try to pilot the submarine to safety, or open the hatch and take his chances in the water (despite Sonic being unable to swim). Though scrapped for Sonic Adventure 2, branching storyline pathways were eventually introduced in Sonic Adventure 2 pseudo-sequel Shadow the Hedgehog; however neither Sonic Adventure 2 nor Shadow the Hedgehog contains any scene with a submarine in it.Sonic Adventure 2 saw simultaneous world-wide release on June 23rd, 2001 - Sonic's 10th Anniversary. A special collectors edition of the game was produced, featuring a large blue case that contained the game, a music CD (featuring tracks spanning Sonic's 10 year history), a Sonic the Hedgehog Retrospective booklet, and a commemorative coin. Though originally intended to be limited edition, so many copies of the 10th Anniversary Edition were published that it is fairly easy to find one for relatively cheap.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The title screen for the Gamecube port, Sonic Adventure 2: BattleThis is the last Sonic the Hedgehog game produced exclusively for Sega hardware. Near the end of the game's development cycle, Sega announced they would no longer be producing console hardware and were transitioning in to becoming a software-only company. One of the first cross-platform releases was a Nintendo Gamecube port of Sonic Adventure 2 entitled \" Sonic Adventure 2: Battle\". It contained more polished graphics, tweaked level designs, and an expanded multiplayer mode that added more playable characters such as Amy and Metal Sonic. It also made use of Game Boy Advance connectivity, in order to replace the Dreamcast's VMU-specific features of the Dreamcast version of the game.Big the Cat (from the original Sonic Adventure) cameos in a secret location in nearly every level in the game. Additionally, by pressing A B simultaneously during some cutscenes, Big the Cat will appear and play a secret animation. Curiously, all of these cameos were removed from the Gamecube version.Prior to the game's release, Sonic Team went to great lengths to keep Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat from being publicly revealed. Only a couple of wide-angle or extreme-close-up images of Shadow were released initially, and Rouge was never mentioned - until toy manufacturer ReSaurus accidentally spilled the beans upon announcing Sonic Adventure 2 action figures. Though ReSaurus went bankrupt before producing these figures, Joyride Studios eventually produced Sonic Adventure 2: Battle action figures.In one of the earliest previews on the game, descriptions were given for a number of Sonic Adventure 2 concept drawings. Of them were the first descriptions of the Good and Evil Chao, and Rouge the Bat (then referred to as \"Nails the Bat\"), but most interesting were descriptions of concept art involving Shadow the Hedgehog (\"Dark Sonic\" in the preview) - images were described of him bearing a scar across his eye and some pieces of art apparently featured him missing an arm. Other pieces of concept art describe a small troll-like creature with a big nose (possibly Professor Gerald), an angelic woman (most likely Maria), and a monster made out of eyes. These concept images have never been seen by the public.Prototype LogoThe Sonic Adventure 2 demo packaged with Phantasy Star Online for the Sega Dreamcast contained a number of subtle differences from the final release, including a different logo, different road-side billboards in City Escape, more loose controls and game physics, different sound effects, an instrumental-only version of the song \"Escape from the City\", and even mild swearing in the game's opening cutscene. One of the more noticeable changes comes in the form of Sonic's shoes: as the demo was produced before Sega struck a merchandising deal with shoe manufacturer Soap Shoes, Sonic instead wears his classic red sneakers in the demo.In the retail version of Sonic Adventure 2, when Sonic busts out of the Helicopter at the start of the Hero Story, he is still wearing his classic red sneakers. When he straps the piece of metal to his shoes, they appear as Soap Shoes.Based on texture/model file names on the Sonic Adventure 2 disc, Shadow the Hedgehog's name might originally have been \"Terios\". In Japanese, \"Terios\" translates to several meanings, most notably \"Reflection\", hinting at his relation to Sonic.Sonic Adventure 2 marked the start of the Sonic series officially recognizing both the name \"Robotnik\" and the name ''Eggman'' as being canon, regardless of region, and the first time a Sonic title uses both names in the story.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen.Two years after Sonic Adventure brought Sega's mascot back to the forefront of the company, Sonic Team released its sequel, Sonic Adventure 2. Boasting vastly improved visuals, a rock-solid 60 frames-per-second framerate, it streamlined and expanded many of the conventions introduced in the original Sonic Adventure. For example, rather than the extended charge-up time required to execute Sonic's \"Light Speed Dash\" in Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2 shortened the name to \"Light Dash\" and had it instantly accessible at the touch of a button. Rather than have Sonic's homing attack lock on to anything near him (even objects behind him), Sonic Adventure 2's homing attack requires players to point Sonic in the general direction of the object they wanted to strike. The ''adventure fields'' hub stages of Sonic Adventure were also removed entirely, putting the focus squarely on action stages just as Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Sonic The Hedgehog 3, and Sonic & Knuckles did. This formula would later be repeated in Sonic Heroes and Shadow The Hedgehog.Shadow the HedgehogCharacters new to the Sonic series were the jewel thief Rouge the Bat and revenge-obsessed Shadow the Hedgehog, whom the game's story conveys as being notoriously similar in appearance to Sonic. (In the story, multiple characters and seemingly the entire human populace mistake him for Sonic.) Returning to the roster is Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The recurring villain of the Sonic series, Doctor Eggman, of course returned, but surprisingly, in Sonic Adventure 2 he made his debut appearance as a player-controlled character. In total this brings the number of playable characters up to six, just as Sonic Adventure had six playable characters. However, rather than having six separate storylines that cross paths, Sonic Adventure 2 divides things up by teams -- the \"Hero\" team, where the good guys (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles) reside, and the \"Dark\" team, home to the bad guys (Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge). Furthermore, whereas the six characters in Sonic Adventure were each more or less unique from each other, in Sonic Adventure 2, each character play style and abilities are for all intents and purposes completely identical to that character's rival. (This is most likely to keep the 2-player versus mode fair.) In this sense, Sonic Adventure 2 has only 3 unique characters, Sonic/Shadow being one, Knuckles/Rouge being another, and Tails/Eggman being the third.Therefore, Sonic Adventure 2 contains only three gameplay types - (not counting the driving stages, of which there are only two) - fueling the \"Rivals\" aspect of the game. Sonic and Shadow are \"Speed\" type characters, and the majority of their levels are high-speed action platforming stages. Tails and Eggman, both piloting mechanized walking armor, are \"Shooting\" type characters, and are essentially Sonic Adventure 2's version of E-102 Gamma's gameplay from the first Sonic Adventure. Finally, Knuckles and Rouge are \"Hunting\" characters, in a reprisal of Knuckles' emerald-hunting gameplay from the first Sonic Adventure, in which the player must rely on a hot-and-cold radar system that alerts you whenever an emerald shard is nearby, and changes color as the distance between you and the emerald increases or decreases.Sonic in 'City Escape!'Not present in Sonic Adventure 2 are the free-roaming \"Adventure Field\" hub worlds from Sonic Adventure. Instead, the game falls back on the traditional linear progression and gameplay-only focus of the classic Sega Genesis Sonic titles. This also gives the narrative a fast-paced feel while it follows multiple ongoing events at once. Cutscenes often bookend levels and boss encounters, and the story frequently jumps around from character to character; in one level you may play as Sonic as he zips through a dense jungle, whereas in the next level you will play as Knuckles as he hunts for emerald pieces in haunted mountains.Proper multiplayer gameplay finally makes a return to the franchise after nearly 7 years of absence, playing off of the rivals aspect: Two players can play race each other to the end goal in each stage as Sonic and Shadow, race each other to find three Emerald Shards as Knuckles and Rouge, and as Tails and Eggman, in their robot walkers, shoot it out in one of several small arenas, with the objective being to deplete the other's life bar.After finishing the game, the player can re-visit any story event in the game via a DVD-style scene selection menu, or play any of the stages themselves by choosing one in the stage select mode. The player is also challenged to earn A-ranks on each stage by performing well in them. Each stage has 4 additional missions in addition to the default one, with each mission having its own A rank threshold to achieve by getting a good enough time or score.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The plot begins with Doctor Eggman infiltrating a military base which had since 50 years prior been hiding his grandfather's greatest invention, Project Shadow. Eggman doesn't know the full details of Project Shadow, but expects it to be some sort of weapon. What he finds instead is a black hedgehog, claiming his name is Shadow. Now free, Shadow promises to lend Doctor Eggman his aid - but that Eggman must first meet Shadow on the Space Colony ARK.''I'm outta here!''A week later, Sonic the Hedgehog finds himself on the run from the Military Organization, G.U.N (Guardian Unit of Nations), who have suddenly claimed that Sonic is a dangerous criminal. Unaware of what is going on, Sonic escapes and attempts to avoid capture when he encounters Shadow the Hedgehog, who is in the middle of stealing a Chaos Emerald. Putting two and two together, Sonic assumes the Military is mistaking Shadow for Sonic (and vice-versa), and that this \"fake\" Hedgehog is the reason Sonic is in so much trouble. Before Sonic can engage Shadow in battle, however, Shadow vanishes in to thin air using a power called \"Chaos Control\", leaving Sonic confused and quickly surrounded by dozens of fully-armed G.U.N soldiers.Once again captured, Sonic is later freed from a prison cell by Amy Rose. Them together with Tails and Knuckles, they attempt to seek out Dr. Eggman and Shadow the Hedgehog in a race against time, while evading the military.Rouge's ReportAfter Sonic Adventure 2 hit retail, SonicTeam published the Official Sonic Adventure 2 Strategy Guide in Japan, which contained \"The Last Report on Project Shadow\", written by the in-game character Rouge the Bat, in an effort to uncover the mystery of who - or what Shadow is, and where he came from. A summary of the report follows:50 years ago, the current President of Nations contracted Professor Gerald Robotnik to research the feasability of immortality. Gerald initially refused to be involved, comparing it to to playing God. But when his niece, Maria Robotnik, contracted the terminal disease NIDS (Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome), Gerald reconsidered the project in the hopes that he could find a cure and save her life. The classified \"Project Shadow\" was launched on the Space Colony ARK where Gerald's science team would not be disturbed, and there they began researching the mysteries of the Chaos Emeralds and how they effected living tissue.One experiment, designed to accelerate the rate of cell regeneration seen in some species of lizards, turned disastrous - the \"Biolizard\" subject grew ten times its normal size and became violent, killing several scientists before being contained. When the Military Organization G.U.N learned of this incident, they sprung in to action in order to shut down Project Shadow (violently, if necessary) before any further lives were lost. When they arrived aboard the ARK, Professor Gerald was already putting the finishing touches on what he called the \"Ultimate Life-form\": an immortal black hedgehog that could harness the energies of the Chaos Emeralds, named after the project he was born from - Shadow. Not knowing what the military would do with a creature like Shadow, Gerald entrusted Maria to take him to an escape pod and head down to the planet below where they would be safe.They were intercepted by G.U.N soldiers, who, in an effort to kill Shadow, accidentally shot Maria instead. With her last dying breath, she sealed Shadow in the escape pod and ejected him to earth. When Professor Gerald heard the news of his niece's death, he flew in to rage and despair; the very project he wanted to use to save her life ended up being the instrument of her demise. Before being captured by G.U.N and sentenced to death for the Biolizard incident on the Space Colony ARK, Professor Gerald gave Shadow strict instructions to carry out revenge for what happened to Maria. But, before that could happen, G.U.N imprisoned Shadow in suspended animation to ensure that the truth about what happened on the ARK was never revealed.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Below is a list of the stages in the game, listed in the order which they are played in the story mode.Hero Story:SONIC: City EscapeKNUCKLES: Wild CanyonTAILS: Prison LaneSONIC: Metal HarborSONIC: Green ForestKNUCKLES: Pumpkin HillTAILS: Mission StreetKNUCKLES: Aquatic Mine[ Driving Stage ]: Route 101TAILS: Hidden BaseSONIC: Pyramid CaveKNUCKLES: Death ChamberTAILS: Eternal EngineKNUCKLES: Meteor HerdSONIC: Crazy GadgetSONIC: Final RushDark Story:EGGMAN: Iron GateROUGE: Dry LagoonEGGMAN: Sand OceanSHADOW: Radical HighwayROUGE: Egg QuartersEGGMAN: Lost ColonyEGGMAN: Weapons BedROUGE: Security HallSHADOW: White Jungle[ Driving Stage ]: Route 280SHADOW: Sky RailROUGE: Mad SpaceEGGMAN: Cosmic WallSHADOW: Final ChaseLast Story:ALL: Cannon's CoreUnlockable:SONIC: Green Hill Zone[CR]Soundtrack Albums[CR]''Sonic Adventure 2 Multi-Dimensional Soundtrack''Front CoverBack CoverAn official 2-disc soundtrack was released, containing almost all of the music from Sonic Adventure 2.

Taking inspiration from their Southern California location, Sonic Team decided to set SA2 in the fictional \"Central City\", featuring their own takes on San Francisco landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and more.Throughout its development cycle, Sonic Adventure 2 changed rather dramatically. Early media and interviews with Yuji Naka point to there only being three playable characters initially: Sonic, Knuckles, and Eggman. After outcry from gamers wondering where certain franchise-staple characters were, Tails, Shadow, and Rouge were revealed to be playable. The fact that Tails, Shadow, and Rouge were possibly added to the roster later in development may help explain why over half the levels in the game recycle assets from other stages.Other early preview material point to the game at one point having branching storyline pathways; one example given of this in effect was a scenario involving Sonic trapped, underwater, in a submarine. The player would be given one of two options: Make Sonic try to pilot the submarine to safety, or open the hatch and take his chances in the water (despite Sonic being unable to swim). Though scrapped for Sonic Adventure 2, branching storyline pathways were eventually introduced in Sonic Adventure 2 pseudo-sequel Shadow the Hedgehog; however neither Sonic Adventure 2 nor Shadow the Hedgehog contains any scene with a submarine in it.Sonic Adventure 2 saw simultaneous world-wide release on June 23rd, 2001 - Sonic's 10th Anniversary. A special collectors edition of the game was produced, featuring a large blue case that contained the game, a music CD (featuring tracks spanning Sonic's 10 year history), a Sonic the Hedgehog Retrospective booklet, and a commemorative coin. Though originally intended to be limited edition, so many copies of the 10th Anniversary Edition were published that it is fairly easy to find one for relatively cheap.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The title screen for the Gamecube port, Sonic Adventure 2: BattleThis is the last Sonic the Hedgehog game produced exclusively for Sega hardware. Near the end of the game's development cycle, Sega announced they would no longer be producing console hardware and were transitioning in to becoming a software-only company. One of the first cross-platform releases was a Nintendo Gamecube port of Sonic Adventure 2 entitled \" Sonic Adventure 2: Battle\". It contained more polished graphics, tweaked level designs, and an expanded multiplayer mode that added more playable characters such as Amy and Metal Sonic. It also made use of Game Boy Advance connectivity, in order to replace the Dreamcast's VMU-specific features of the Dreamcast version of the game.Big the Cat (from the original Sonic Adventure) cameos in a secret location in nearly every level in the game. Additionally, by pressing A B simultaneously during some cutscenes, Big the Cat will appear and play a secret animation. Curiously, all of these cameos were removed from the Gamecube version.Prior to the game's release, Sonic Team went to great lengths to keep Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat from being publicly revealed. Only a couple of wide-angle or extreme-close-up images of Shadow were released initially, and Rouge was never mentioned - until toy manufacturer ReSaurus accidentally spilled the beans upon announcing Sonic Adventure 2 action figures. Though ReSaurus went bankrupt before producing these figures, Joyride Studios eventually produced Sonic Adventure 2: Battle action figures.In one of the earliest previews on the game, descriptions were given for a number of Sonic Adventure 2 concept drawings. Of them were the first descriptions of the Good and Evil Chao, and Rouge the Bat (then referred to as \"Nails the Bat\"), but most interesting were descriptions of concept art involving Shadow the Hedgehog (\"Dark Sonic\" in the preview) - images were described of him bearing a scar across his eye and some pieces of art apparently featured him missing an arm. Other pieces of concept art describe a small troll-like creature with a big nose (possibly Professor Gerald), an angelic woman (most likely Maria), and a monster made out of eyes. These concept images have never been seen by the public.Prototype LogoThe Sonic Adventure 2 demo packaged with Phantasy Star Online for the Sega Dreamcast contained a number of subtle differences from the final release, including a different logo, different road-side billboards in City Escape, more loose controls and game physics, different sound effects, an instrumental-only version of the song \"Escape from the City\", and even mild swearing in the game's opening cutscene. One of the more noticeable changes comes in the form of Sonic's shoes: as the demo was produced before Sega struck a merchandising deal with shoe manufacturer Soap Shoes, Sonic instead wears his classic red sneakers in the demo.In the retail version of Sonic Adventure 2, when Sonic busts out of the Helicopter at the start of the Hero Story, he is still wearing his classic red sneakers. When he straps the piece of metal to his shoes, they appear as Soap Shoes.Based on texture/model file names on the Sonic Adventure 2 disc, Shadow the Hedgehog's name might originally have been \"Terios\". In Japanese, \"Terios\" translates to several meanings, most notably \"Reflection\", hinting at his relation to Sonic.Sonic Adventure 2 marked the start of the Sonic series officially recognizing both the name \"Robotnik\" and the name ''Eggman'' as being canon, regardless of region, and the first time a Sonic title uses both names in the story. In Sonic Adventure 2, ''Robotnik'' is established as being Doctor Eggman's family name, whereas the name ''Eggman'' is his more commonly-used nickname or alias.A number of texture files in Sonic Adventure 2 are actually high resolution images featuring lengthy amounts of text detailing normally unseen story elements, such as a computer read-out on The Biolizard detailing the creature's life cycle.Two unused cutscenes were discovered among Sonic Adventure 2's dialog files, which evidently would have appeared at or near the end of the game's story. The first of these two lost cutscenes is a scene between The President and his Secretary - the President does not believe that heroes exist and has doubt that Sonic and Shadow will be successful in saving the earth, but his secretary urges him not to give up believing in heroes. This scene was restored in the Sonic Adventure 2 anime adaptation featured in the TV series Sonic X, and is actually referenced in 2005's Shadow the Hedgehog. The second lost cutscene is during the credits roll, while Tails and Eggman are reminiscing about Professor Gerald; Eggman turns to walk away, but stops mid-step, declaring he will still conquer the world and he and Tails make a pact that the next time they meet, neither will hold back.There are certain lines of English dialogue in Sonic Adventure 2 that do not coincide with the Japanese dialogue. Most notably, in a scene near the end of the game, Shadow declares \"Is that what Chaos Control is?\" -- the line, if properly translated, would have read \"Was that Chaos Control?\", or even simply \"...Chaos Control?\"One translation issue is the fact that, during gameplay, some of the characters' voice clips are in fact Japanese exclamations spoken in plain English. (such as Sonic's \"TERIA!\" and Eggman frequently saying \"Yosh!\")Steve Broadie, who voiced the President (as well as E-102 Gamma in the previous Sonic Adventure), passed away shortly after Sonic Adventure 2 was released.[CR]",

In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life.[CR]Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Soulcalibur is the second installment in the \"Soul\" fighting game series, with the first being  Soul Edge/Soul Blade, which originally featured in arcades and was later ported to Sony's PlayStation console. The game was developed and produced by  Namco, who felt that the newer Sega Dreamcast system would better suit a sequel as it offered better graphical power and it very quickly became one of the most popular and best selling Dreamcast games.The game is set three years after the first game. The name of the game itself comes from the weapon created to help defeat the evil Soul Edge Blade in the first installment.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]TakiPirate  Cervantes de Leon of Spain obtained the mythical Sword of Legends also known as the 'Soul Edge'. The sword devoured his soul and turned him insane, slaying his entire crew. For a good 20 years the Dread Pirate stayed silent in the Sea Port Town of Valencia where he would take the souls of those who reached him during their search for the legendary sword. Soon began a reign of terror, violence and pain, yet the joint efforts of the divine warrior Sophitia and the underground Ninja Taki were enough to stop the violent Cervantes in his tracks and in the process breaking one of the twin Soul Blades in half. Another warrior happened upon the remains of Soul Edge, the young knight,  Siegfried. Upon approaching the blades, Cervantes rose, bathed in hellfire, wielding the broken blades. He had become  Inferno, the condensed will of the evil sword. Siegfried swiftly dealt with the weakened monster. After the battle, he picked up the Famous blade. Soul Edge took control of his mind, much as it did Cervantes, using the memory of Siegfried's dead father as a tool to get the boy to harvest souls for the evil sword. With the evil seed infecting him, Siegfried had turned into a  Nightmare, clad in Azure armor.Three Years later, the Azure Nightmare and its crazed minions have gathered enough souls to start a ritual to return Soul Edge to its formal power. Unknown to Nightmare and his followers, a group of young warriors meet on their journeys to stop Soul Edge and with them three sacred weapons are joined once again.[CR][B]Features:[/B][CR]Soulcalibur has many familiar features that currently exist in the fighting genre. Modes such as Arcade Mode, which consists of choosing one of the sixteen characters found within the game and fighting through 8 rounds with the 7th round opponent being based around the character the player is controlling and the story they tell. The game also features other classic modes such as Vs Mode, Time Attack, Team Battle, Survival and Training Mode.The game also featured a Mission Mode, which allowed the player to move through various levels where fighting and fulfilling tasks earns players special points which can be spent on new costumes, artwork, CG Portraits, fanart, and sketches. Another feature is the 'Exhibition Videos' or 'Katas', as they were also known; these videos allow the player to see various characters performing Katas with the weapon of choice.Soulcalibur is the only Soulcalibur game to be without the extra weapons feature; a feature that existed in Soul Blade/Edge,  Soulcalibur II, and  Soulcalibur III.5 of the 19 characters available will given an extra 3rd costume to unlock using the Mission Mode. These characters are Maxi, Voldo, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Xianghua. Also, each character counted with an extra 'transparent' version of their costume in the arcade Version and in the Dreamcast Version counted with a 'Liquid Metal' version of the characters costume.The game was notable for featuring an eight-way run system, which allows the player to use rolls and sidesteps, compared to the third axis system which only allows the player to move from side to side.[CR]Versions[CR]Sega DreamcastDreamcast version playable characters.Soulcalibur was first released in Japan on the 5th of August 1999 and would be a launch title in North America on the 9th of September 1999. When released, it was highly praised and became a fine example of a port being better then its original with much improved graphics, game modes, gameplay changes and new costumes, not to mention the inclusion of a new extra character in  Cervantes De Leon. At the time of release, the  Dreamcast version was cited as being one of the best looking games of all time. It was also a version which saw new modes such as Team Battle, Survival and Training Mode. An 'Artwork' section was also added which included character based artwork, FanArt and general high-res art. A 'Liquid Metal' version of characters' costumes was also added along with a Battle Theater, which allows the player to watch battles between two AI-controlled characters. In the North American release of Soulcalibur, one of  Voldo's codpieces, which featured a bull was removed; however, the Japanese and European Versions kept it in the game.Xbox Live MarketplaceApril 2008 saw  Namco Bandai announce that a port of the classic fighter would be released on Microsoft's  Xbox Live Marketplace. It was made available for download on July 2nd 2008, and featured improved HD graphics and LIVE leaderboards. To the dismay of Soulcalibur fans Namco Bandai confirmed that no online mode would be added to the game, this, added to the fact that the Mission Mode found in the original Dreamcast Version is missing, meant that the port got less than impressive reviews from both the gaming media and fans. The game did feature most of the modes available from the original and also saw everything unlocked from the beginning which allowed a player to use characters that were originally locked in the Dreamcast version from the start.This version features the following playable characters:HwangYoshimitsuLizardmanSiegfriedRockSeung MinaCervantesEdge MasterVoldoIvySophitiaMitsurugiKilikXianghuaMaxiNightmareTakiAstaroth[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Soulcalibur went on to be a huge hit on Sega's Dreamcast system, selling over 1 Million copies in 1999 alone. As well as this, at the time of release, the game received numerous positive reviews. The game went on to spawn numerous sequels.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Disc One1.\"Light & Darkness\"\u5149\u3068\u95c7\u306e\u95d8\u3044\uff08\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\uff092:012.\"The Stage

Space Channel 5 follows news reporter Ulala, a reporter for Space Channel 5, the TV station that she works for, in her quest to report on the breaking news of space aliens known as Morolians, forcing people to dance. Ulala is also tasked with saving these dancing hostages in the process of reporting by, how else, dancing right back at the aliens! Along the way, she runs into rival news reporters Pudding, and Jaguar (JAGUAAAR!), who she must out-dance. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Space Channel 5 is essentially a dressed-up version of the classic electronic game Simon. The player is given a series of commands in rapid succession which they must memorize and repeat (i.e. \"Up, Right, Left, Down, Shoot, Shoot, Shoot!\"). As this is a rhythm game, the commands must also be repeated at a specific tempo. When Ulala successfully saves hostages these characters become Ulala's back-up dancers.[CR]Graphics[CR]The game's characters all dance and move in real-time, whereas the backgrounds are streaming pre-rendered video.[CR]Lawsuit[CR]In the earlier part of 2003, Lady Miss Kier, formerly of the band Deee-lite, sued SEGA for using her likeness as the basis for Ulala's character. She cited SEGA's use of knee-high boots, short skirts, and pink ponytails as evidence of SEGA copying her persona to make Ulala. She also claimed that SEGA had offered her $16k to license her name, songs, and image for the game, which she rejected. She later discovered that SEGA went ahead and used her image anyway, so she brought a legal suit against them. She ended up in losing the suit and also the appeal and was required to pay for SEGA's legal fees totaling approximately $600k. [CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space reporter Ulala is back on the scene with a thrilling sequel to Space Channel 5 that improves on the original in every conceivable way. Sega delivers improved music, expanded game mechanics and oodles of the 60s sci-fi style that made Space Channel 5 a cult classic, despite the low sales.    Space Channel 5: Part 2 was originally released on Dreamcast in Japan, but was not brought to the United States. Fortunately for fans, Agetec released a double pack of the Dreamcast games for Playstation 2. The emulation was perfect, which was surprising given the budget price of $20 for the game. In 2011, the game was released as a digital download on Steam and Xbox Live Marketplace as a part of the Dreamcast Collection. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Rhythm Rouges have invaded the galaxy, and are forcing people to dance!       The galaxy is threatened yet again by evildoers with wicked dance moves! This time, the robotic Rhythm Rogues have kidnapped over 300,000 people throughout the galaxy! The villainous Purge kidnaps Space President Peace and demands a ransom of 6.6 trillion space dollars which must be delivered to point Double X! Intrepid reporter Ulala is back on the scene, and will get to the bottom of the story with her funky dance moves.   To get the scoop, Ulala must reunite with the characters of the first Space Channel 5, including Jaguar, Pudding and Space Michael! New allies like Pine, a member of the Sexy Space Police are there to help her. With a whole new cast of bosses to dance battle, Ulala will need every bit of help.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Space Channel 5 is a variant of the 80s electronic game \"Simon Says,\" where players must match the commands in rhythm to the music.  For example, a captured character might request the sequence, \"Up, down, up, down, chu, chu, chu!\" Players would have to press \"Up, down, up, down, X, X, X\" in rhythm to the music. To succeed, a sense of rhythm and a good memory are key. Often, on screen cues remind the player of the sequence. For instance, two chu commands would be visually indicated with two robots. If the sequence is correctly entered, the player is rewarded with seeing the robots blasted.  This sequel introduces several new gameplay mechanics that make the experience more complex. A \"Recuse\" beam is added to Ulala's arsenal, which is activated with the circle button. The beam is used to rescue hostages. If the button is not pressed at the correct time, the hostage is not rescued and they are not added to the list of biographies on the title screen.   The second gameplay mechanic that has been added is the hold function. For instance, Ulala might get the command sequence \"Chu! Chu! Chuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu! Chu!\" Ulala would have to hold the X button on the third input for the correct amount of time.   A Morolian pops on screen when the correct secret command is inputed      Secrets have been added to the gameplay, which boost Ulala's ratings. The key is to hit X at the correct time in the cutscenes. For example, on the first stage if you press X for the second and third notes of the \"Mexican Flyer\" opening theme song, Morolians pop out of the edges of the screen and Ulala gets a boost to her ratings. Finding secrets is not critical for success, but does give the player more room to make mistakes in boss battles.   Rather than having a set number of hearts, or allowable mistakes during boss battles - the number is calculated based on her ratings. This is a major change from the original game, and makes the gameplay before the boss sequences more important. Do well and you will have plenty of extra chances should you make a mistake. Do poorly and expect to repeat the level.   Also, in the original, enemies popped in after the end of every sequence, requiring Ulala to blast them with an single Chu command. This is largely the same, but instead of blasting them Ulala strikes a funky dance pose.[CR]Characters  [CR]Ulala Ulala poses with her trademark microphone     The heroine of Space Channel 5, who the player almost always controls. This 22-year-old reporter is voiced by Apollo Smile, and carried both a microphone and two blasters in a garter holster. In the original game, she discovered that Blank, the CEO of Space Channel 5 was controlling the Morolians and forcing them to invade the galaxy for ratings. Players can look forward to unlocking new outfits for her on every stage. Successfully rescuing hostages rewards the players with \"costumes\" which simply swap Ulala's model for other characters.    Pudding Rival reporter Pudding shows up to challenge Ulala to a dance battle      Pudding is Ulala's rival, and a returning character from the first Space Channel 5. She's taller and thinner than Ulala, and according to her biography had two nose jobs while she was a teenager. She plays a guitar in the new music sequences of the game.   Moroliians In the first Space Channel 5, the Moroliians invaded the galaxy. In this episode, they've been freed of their brainwashing and often fight alongside Ulala. They also deliver reports in the game's cutscenes.   Jaguar   Pirate broadcaster Jaguar is rescued by Ulala     Jaguar is the primary love intrest in Space Channel 5. A blond, dashing pirate reporter,  he saved Ulala after the destruction of Blank and Giant Evila. Initially in the sequel, Jaguar has gone missing.  Shadow Shadow is a henchman of the villainous Purge, and is dressed entirely in black. In the first three stages of the game, he is frequently there, kidnapping people and executing his boss's evil orders.  Space Michael Portrayed by Michael Jackson.Pine Pine plays drums in the music sequences      Pine is a new major character for this sequel and a member of the Sexy Space Police. She warns people, \"When there's slime, involved in a crime - we'll clean him up on the beat!\" She is from Texas and wears a cowboy hat. Most of stage three is spent combatting her, as she wants to stop Ulala from reporting and \"disrupting the investigation.\"  Ulala encounters Pine on Stage 3, but joins forces with her to stop Purge later in the game.  She plays drums in the music sequences, as do her two deputies.    Purge The villainous Purge demands his ransom       Purge is the main villain of Space Channel 5 part 2. He's responsible for kidnapping Space President Peace and for stealing the transmitter for Space Channel 5. He could be said to have an effeminate voice and manner, and has a white loop of hair wildly reaching for the sky.  Purge has control of Shadow, and frequently appears on television screens to command him. In the final boss battle, we learn that his true reason for kidnapping hundreds of thousands of people is to force the galaxy to watch his television show.      Space President Peace  Space President Peace before his kidnapping      Ulala's main mission in this sequel is to rescue the Space President, who has been kidnapped by Purge. Ulala must be careful not to hit him while saving him. For example, in stage 4 Shadow seals the president inside a giant dancing robot. Ulala must enter in the opposite of the sequence given in order to rescue him. For instance, Purge says \"Left, right, chu\" Ulala must enter \"Right, Left, Chu.\" Space President Peace also sings the song for the closing credits of the game. He wears glasses with star shaped frames.   [CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Like the previous game in the series, the soundtrack to Space Channel 5: Part 2 was primarily composed by Naofumi Hayata, but was joined by a series of collaborators including Mariko Nanba, Tomoya Ohtani and Kenichi Tokoi.

Still, reviews were favorable. IGN gave Space Channel 5 a 7.4 and praised its budget price of $20. Reviewer Douglass Perry noted, \"It's a steal. If you have any mind for music games, you need Space Channel 5. \"  Gamespot was more mixed in its analysis, giving the game a 6.9. Reviewer Brad Shoemaker mused, \"It's a little rough around the edges, but Ulala is still swinging.\" He went on to praise the style of the game. \"Every so often you run into a game that's a little short on gameplay, but so long on quirky appeal that you can't help loving it.\"[CR]",

It has a large variety or unlockable characters, many items and weapons to pick up while traversing through the large, unique levels, and multiple modes of play.Single Player is basically battling through levels until the boss arrives (usually on a timer) collecting points and power-ups . Rinse, Wash, and Repeat. The cool thing about this is that almost everything in the game is unlockable, and playing through certain scenarios with different characters will cause different weapons to appear, and more things to unlock. Every character is equipped with a specific set of weapons at the launch of the first level, and opening chests gives you item drops, sometimes based on your equipped weapon, which makes it really hard to get everything in the game.Co-op is similar to Single player, but split screen and has a few different scenarios and unlockables.Multiplayer in this game is really where the game is the strongest. You get to take all the unlocked weapons anf characters, and destroy up to three of your friends in head-to-head body -cutting action. Some of the characters have a hover ability, some can punch people's torso right off their pelvis,. others shoot guns or have fire ball breath. As in the campaign style modes, there is also the abilty to open chests and get upgraded weapons, but it makes it a little more difficult to get open chest while you're getting kicked in the head by an angel with a halberd.There are a few other modes like a tiered team fighting mode, much like Mortal Kombat but with two people.[CR]Character List[CR]Spawn: In the Demon's Hand features a total of thirty-seven playable characters, with twelve unlocked right from the beginning.

Players control a squad of special operations soldiers who must carry out a string of tactical missions across the planet. Unlike previous Spec Ops games, a single soldier is controlled instead of a complete squad. The mission objectives include destroying enemy compounds, recovering military hardware and rescuing hostages. They take place in five different locales: Antarctica, Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Germany. Each country has a specific mission that entails promoting the well being of the United States of America - there is no specific storyline but rather a collection of missions to complete. Most of them are based on possible future events in the 21st century, not based on existing, historical conflicts.[CR]The success of the mission depends on the preparations (determining the equipment), which weapons are chosen and which soldier is picked. Each soldier has different abilities and some are better suited for specific missions than others. The six classed include infantry, grenadier, machine gunner, sniper, close quarters, and demolition. Each class has a different payload and arsenal to his disposal, including items such as medical kits and optical devices that are restricted to a specific soldier.[CR]The game is shown from a first-person perspective, common for the Windows titles in the series, but not the PlayStation console versions.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Star Wars: Episode I - Racer is a fast paced anti-gravity racing game based on the infamous \"Pod Race\" from The Phantom Menace movie. The player can reach extremely high speeds and use quick reflexes to dodge oncoming racers and obstacles. The racer begins each of the three lap races with three lives, meaning that in contrast to the film crashing doesn't mean your race is over, but is more of a minor setback. Once the lives are all used up, however, the racer is disqualified. Alongside the home console (of which just the N64 version was published by Nintendo) and computer versions, a port for the Game Boy Color was released with entirely different tracks, but similar core gameplay. Of greater note is Star Wars: Racer Arcade (developed jointly by Sega AM5 [later renamed Sega Rosso] and Lucasarts), which put the public in the seat of Anakin Skywalker's Pod with a cockpit shaped control deck. Two levers were used to control the game, mirroring events in the film. There are only four tracks in the Arcade, many less than the other versions.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: While the characters are given individual backstories which show some to be inexperienced or unmotivated to seek victory, the game treats them all as dedicated and talented racers.Anakin SkywalkerA hero from the film which the game is based on. Anakin is a young human, notable for being the only of his race capable of participating in the dangerous game of podracing.SebulbaSebulba, a Dug, is a popular and successful racer who worked his way to the top by cheating. He is the only racer in the game to have a weapon. When using Sebulba's taunt, a flamethrower spouts out sideways.Bozzie BarantaOnce a mechanic for Gasgano, Bozzie chose to become a racer. He was fairly successful in this venture.Aldar BeedoWhile Aldar Beedo is a talented racer, his first priority is his work as a hitman, taking out racers to pave the way to victory for whoever pays for his services.Toy DampnerDampner is a menacing pilot. While he is known to race elsewhere, he prefers the tracks of Oovo IV, where he is a crowd favorite.Dud BoltA racer hired by Sebulba who is paid per race based on how many competing pods he is able to take out.GasganoAn experienced and talented racer who does not hesitate to take out racers who get in his way.Mars GuoA loudmouth braggart with a fondness for gambling and drinking. While he is a competent racer, his tendency to anger other racers often leads to his downfall.Ebe EndocottOnce a daredevil delivery man, Endocott was encouraged by his boss to take up podracing, where his daredevil ways and piloting skills let him achieve some success.Cy YungaA talented racer with an advanced pod. Yunga is only available in-game through a cheat code, causing him to replace \"Bullseye\" Navior.Ratts TyerellRatts Tyerell is a racer who gained success for his swift reflexes. He owns one of the largest podracers in the circuit.Fud SangA somewhat mediocre and unknown racer, who nevertheless is paranoid of being sabotaged by his opponents.Boles RoorA podracer who also excels at singing, Roor pilots an outdated podracer that nevertheless boasts a high top speed.Ark \"Bumpy\" RooseRoose is a particularly dim-witted pilot who is known for indiscriminately ramming into opposing racers.Wan SandageSandage is a podracer who gained a great deal of fame on his homeworld of Ord Radama. However, he is less successful on other planets, where he suffers from disorientation.Jinn ReesoLittle is known about Jinn Reeso. He is only available for use through a cheat code, causing him to replace Mars Guo.Ben QuadinarosQuadinaros is an inexperienced racer, racing out of his league with an experimental four-engine pod.Slide ParamitaParamita is an elitist racer who uses a small pod. He disapproves of racers who use bulky podracers.MawhonicA very talented racer who sells parts in his spare time.\"Bullseye\" NaviorNavior is a talented pilot who gained the nickname \"Bullseye\" for his unique looking eyes.Teemto PagaliesDespite being a drunkard, Pagalies is one of the least corrupt racers in the sport. He is a crowd pleaser, known for performing daring stunts during races.Ody MandrellMandrell is a racer who participates not for money, but for an adrenaline rush. His tough skin lets him survive otherwise deadly crashes.Neva KeeNeva Kee stands out among the other racers for his unique podracer. Its engines are attached directly to the cockpit and jut out behind it. This makes the cockpit the frontmost part of the pod, greatly increasing the risk of death in a crash.Elan MakElan Mak is actually a bounty hunter named Kam Nale. He joined the podracing circuit in order to hunt down Aldar Beedo. When he discovered his talent for the sport, he became involved with it beyond his initial intention to only use it as a front to catch Beedo.Clegg Holdfast A reporter for Podracing Quarterly, Holdfast participates in races primarily in order to get an inside scoop. Despite his ulterior motives, he showed himself to be a talented racer.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]N64, Dreamcast, PC and Mac Versions:There are four main modes within the game. The single player story mode, called \"Tournament\", is a sequence of championships of increasing difficulty composed of several races each in which the player competes for trophies. New tracks, racers and upgrades are unlocked by playing through it and Credits earned by winning races allows you to add new parts to your Pod. The difficulty level in Tournament mode can't be set. Free Race mode is essentially the exhibition mode in which players compete in single races but can't unlock rewards, however the level of the opponents' challenge can be determined. Time Attack is no different to any other mode with this name, as the player attempts to beat a track as quickly as possible. There is also a local two player mode, and the level and number of AI racers can be altered.[CR]Planets[CR]TatooineOnly two of the game's courses are found in Tatooine. The first is the Boonta Training Course, an easy map that acquaints players with the game. The second is the Boonta Classic, which is a relatively faithful recreation of the racetrack from the movie.Mon GazzaMon Gazza is a Mars-like world with vast red deserts, crowded but small cities, and lava pits. Tracks here often involve large open spaces that quickly turn to narrow corridors.Ando PrimeAndo Prime is an ice world. Tracks here take players through numerous caves, and often take them across slick, icy surfaces. Many tracks in this world feature a shortcut that opens up in laps 2 and on, in which the racer may turn left immediately past the finish line and enter a tent that hides a tunnel.AquilarisAquilaris is composed largely of water, and its tracks take place largely in the infrastructure built on the water. Players are taken through underwater tunnels through which massive fish may be seen.MalastareMalastare is a dark world with many sharp turns and visual obstructions such as gas and rocky pillars. Tracks here are narrow and unforgiving.BaroondaBaroonda is a jungle world. Players race through a variety of environments here, including thick rain forests, beaches, and a volcano.Ord IbannaRacetracks on Ord Ibanna are all located on infrastructure floating in a cloudy sky. These tracks often feature elevated shortcuts that are difficult to stay on because they are narrow.Oovo IVOovo IV is a large, asteroid-like world. Players race through open expanses along with urban areas. The highest speeds achievable in the game are found here in anti-gravity tunnels.[CR]Track Overview[CR]There are several tracks on each of the available planets, and every racer has at least one signature track. There are 25 tracks in total, divided into four categories: Amatuer, Semi-Pro, Galactic, and Invitational.Tracks in order of appearance:Boonta Training CoursePlanet - TatooineCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - SebulbaPod Racing!Mon Gazza SpeedwayPlanet - Mon GazzaCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - Teemto PagaliesBeedo's Wild RidePlanet - Ando PrimeCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - Aldar BeedoAquilaris ClassicPlanet - AquilarisCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - Clegg HoldfastMalastare 100Planet - MalastareCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - Dud BoltVengeancePlanet - Oovo IVCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - Fud SangSpice Mine RunPlanet - Mon GazzaCircuit - AmateurAdvantage - Mars Guo / Jinn ReesoSunken CityPlanet - AquilarisCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - \"Bullseye\" Navior / Cy YungaHowler GorgePlanet - Ando PrimeCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - Ratts TyerellDug DerbyPlanet - MalastareCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - Elan MakMore Pod Racing!Scrapper's RunPlanet - Ord IbannaCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - Wan SandageZugga ChallengePlanet - Mon GazzaCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - Boles RoorBaroo CoastPlanet - BaroondaCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - Neva KeeBumpy's BreakersPlanet - AquilarisCircuit - Semi-ProAdvantage - Ark \"Bumpy\" RooseExecutionerPlanet - Oovo IVCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - Toy DampnerSebulba's LegacyPlanet - MalastareCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - SebulbaGrabvine GatewayPlanet - BaroondaCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - Anakin SkywalkerAndobi Mountain RunPlanet - Ando PrimeCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - MawhonicDethro's RevengePlanet - Ord IbannaCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - Ody MandrellFire Mountain RallyPlanet - BaroondaCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - Ebe EndocottBoonta ClassicPlanet - TatooineCircuit - GalacticAdvantage - SebulbaAndo Prime CentrumPlanet - Ando PrimeCircuit - InvitationalAdvantage - Slide ParamitaAbyssPlanet - Ord IbannaCircuit - InvitationalAdvantage - Bozzie BarantaThe GauntletPlanet - Oovo IVCircuit - InvitationalAdvantage - GasganoInfernoPlanet - BaroondaCircuit - InvitationalAdvantage - Ben QuadinarosEven though the planets host multiple races, it does not mean that those races are at all similar.[CR]Attribute Overview[CR]Each pod has 15 total attributes that determine its racing performance. You can buy parts for them, but you can only affect 7 total attributes by doing so. The others are set in stone for each unique pod.Upgradeable Attributes:Repair Rate - Affects the speed at which the pod repairs its damage.How to Upgrade - Buy some REPAIR parts.Best Part: Cluster 2 Power Plug 7,000Cool Rate - Affects the speed at which the pod cools down just after using your boost.How to Upgrade - Buy some COOLING parts.Best Part: Turbo Coolant Pump 5,400Airbrake Inverse - Affects the speed at which a pod can slow itselfHow to Upgrade - Buy some BRAKING parts.Best Part: Quadrijet Air Brake 14,000Maximum Speed - Affects your top speed.How to Upgrade - Buy some MAX SPEED upgrades.Best Part: Block 6 Thrust Coil 20,000Acceleration - Affects the rate at which a pod can achieve its top speedHow to Upgrade - Buy some ACCELERATION upgrades.Best Part: Mag 6 Injector 14,000Turn Response - Affects the speed at which a pod reacts to steering commands.How to Upgrade - Buy some TURNING upgrades.Best Part: Control Stabilizer 7,500Anti-Skid - Affects the ability of the pod to stay on course during a hazardous race or through a sharp turn.How to Upgrade - Buy some TRACTION upgrades.Best Part: R-600 Repulsorgirp 6,000Non-Upgradeable Attributes:Maximum Turn Rate - How good a pod can turn.Deceleration Inverse - The rate at which a pod will slow down without applying brakes.Boost Thrust - Dictates how fast a pod can go during a boost.Heat Rate - How fast a pod overheats.Hover Height - How high a pod sits in the air whilst idling.Bump Mass - Dictates how much damage your pod deals during a collision.Damage Immunity - Your pod's ability to resist damage during collisions.Intersect Radius - The size of your pod. The larger it is, the more hard it will be to navigate tight spaces.[CR]Podracer Overview[CR]Speeds are in miles per hour (mph).Sebulba's Pod is the fastest pod before upgrades, capable of reaching speeds up to 600 mph without using boost.Ben Quadinaros has the fastest unmodified pod with boost, reaching speeds of over 1000 mph.The highest speed without cheats is in the neighborhood of 1400 mph, during the zero gravity portions of Oovo IV.The highest speed with cheats is reportedly roughly of 3000 mph.The only character with a weapon onboard their Pod is Sebulba, who has hidden flamethrowers on each side that can be activated to damage other racers.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Starlancer is a space combat simulator set in the year 2160 as a conflict breaks out between two intergalactic colonial powers from Earth in an escalated pseudo-Cold War. The Alliance, embodying the nations of the contemporary 'Western World' is at odds with the Coalition representing Russia, China, and the Middle-East, and the story covers the outbreak of the war between them. As a rookie pilot in a volunteer division on the Alliance side, the player is evaluated on mission performance to climb up the military ranks.The game was created by Erin Roberts during the decline in popularity of space combat simulators and doomed the Roberts' brothers development company Digital Anvil to financial failure. This resulted in an acquisition by Microsoft Studios, the departure of Chris Roberts from the company, and development of the game's successor, Freelancer.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Starlancer opens with a brutal attack on an Alliance base by Coalition forces following their feigned acceptance of a peace treaty, but it is only a part of a larger attack in which the Coalition wrests control of several key planets from Alliance hands. The story follows the 45th Flying Tigers, aVolunteer squadron, as they recover from the initial attacks and take part in the larger maneuverings of Alliance forces to recover lost territories.Proficiency at dogfighting earns respect from NPCs and unlocks new shipsBetween missions the player is informed of events happening in the larger scope of the war between the Alliance and the Coalition. Through the course of the game as the player is promoted to higher ranks, he or she meets or fights against important figures referenced in cutscenes, indicating the larger role they begin to play in the intergalactic conflict. The bulk of the narrative is communicated through radio or video transmission, the tone varying with mission performance. The game is largely focused on defense missions where the player must fend off waves of enemies attempting to destroy Alliance capital ships, but there are also later missions devoted solely to dogfighting and assaulting Coalition fleets.[CR]Ships[CR] AlianceThere are twelve Alliance ships divided into three classes with individual attributes and special abilities. Better ships are unlocked as the player is promoted for mission performance. The game also has nine fighters belonging to the enemy faction the Coalition which are not playable through the storyline.The ships are piloted in cockpit view with an extensive control scheme including joystick support with a keyboard on PC, while the Dreamcast version is limited strictly to the controller. Consequently, many advanced ship functions are categorized under sub-menus and accessed through different button combinations.      Coyote:   One of the first ships you have access to, its Blind fire ability and large missile storage the Coyote is a good allrounder  Clearance required before use- 1st Lieutenant  Used predominantly by-  No squad uses as  their  primary shipCoyote Class-  Medium Speed-    6 Acceleration-  10   Agility-  6   Shields-  6   Recharge-  3   Armour-  5   Special ability-  Blind Fire   Afterburner Fuel- 100 SecondsMissile Hardpoints-  7  Weapon loadout- 2 Proton Cannons, Rear Laser Cannon Crusader:   One of the initially available ships. Its Spectral shields plus extra afterburner fuel offers some extra protection over other light ships, but its poor fire power make it a less favourable ship.

Its Gatling laser cannons use ammunition rather than energy, this means they can be fired constantly which gives it an early game advantage, though it can run out of ammo. This is the ship used in the training missions and thus the first ship you are likely to pilot.

Mirage IV:  This fast and agile mid game ship is good for hit and run tactics but its lower firepower compared to other ships available means it is ofter overlooked.

Its lack of Blind fire makes it a harder to use ship for a beginner but once mastered will be very affective in dogfights. Clearance required before use- 2nd Lieutenant   Used predominantly by- 406th Blades, 409th RoninNaginata Class-  Light Speed-  7 Acceleration-  3   Agility-   8 Shields-  5   Recharge-  3   Armour-    3 Special ability-  Spectral Sheild    Afterburner Fuel- 130  Seconds Missile Hardpoints-  3   Weapon loadout- Patriot:   A fast and agile ship with decent firepower.

They are not playable though youHades Bomber  may have to protect them in some missions and in others they will be used to destroy Coalition cruisers. There are two models: The Galahad: A two torpedo bomber which is reasonably fast and agile. The Hades: A four torpedo bomber which is slower than the Galahad but carries much more fire power and is slightly tougher.  Coalition:The Coalition has a group of 10 ships it will use against you; 8 Fighters 1 Gunship and 1 Bomber   Azan: The Azan is the coalitions light fighter and the fighter that will be fighting against you most in the early stages of the game. AzanClass: Light Speed: 6Acceleration: 8Agility: 6Shields: 5Recharge: 4Armour: 1Special ability: None Hardpoints: 1 Basilisk:  The Basilisk is the fight fighter you will encounter int he game dispite being flown by the Coalitions elite Black Guard.

Basilisk Class:  Medium Speed: 6   Acceleration:  5 Agility:  10 Shields:  10 Recharge:  5 Armour:  7 Special ability:  Cloaking Hardpoints: 10  Haidar: Haidars are very slow and very large but they do have exceedingly powerful armor and decent shields which can make them difficult to take down. Haidar Class:  Medium Speed:  4 Acceleration:  7 Agility:  4 Shields:  6 Recharge:  4 Armour:  10 Special ability: Spectral Shields   Hardpoints: 2  Karak: Karak have strong armor and shields, they are rare fighters and their blind fire can make them difficult to avoid. Karak Class:  Medium Speed:  4 Acceleration:  7 Agility:  4 Shields:  9 Recharge:  5 Armour:  6 Special ability:  Blind fire Hardpoints: 2  Kossac: The Kossac is the Coalitions heavy fighter. It has strong armour and shields which make it very difficult to bring down. Its fire power is quite low however.Kossac Class:  Heavy Speed:  6 Acceleration:  7 Agility:  6 Shields:  6 Recharge:  5 Armour:  14 Special ability:  None Hardpoints: 10  Lagg:  A medium ship with a huge amount of fire power at the front and good shield.

Luda Salin  Class:  Light Speed:  6 Acceleration:  7 Agility:  6 Shields:  5 Recharge:  5 Armour:  2 Special ability:  None Hardpoints: 2  Saracen:  The Saracen is average at everything with the exception of acceleration which is reasonably high.saracen Class:  Medium Speed:  5 Acceleration:  8 Agility:  6 Shields:  4 Recharge:  3 Armour:  4 Special ability:  None Hardpoints: 3  Kurgen: The Kurgen is a gunship as instead of a fighter. It will be found escorting cruisers. ItKrugen Class Corvette doesn't have full shields. Kurgens have formidable fire power but like cruisers you can shoot off their guns and after that the are defenceless.      Kamov: The Kamov is the Coalitions bomber. They carry 4 torpedos, and will warp in fire and warp out. Killing the ships them selves is easyKamov Bomber  due to their lack of armor and is advisable because killing one ship is easier than 4 torpedos. The player will pilot a Kamov in one of the later missions.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]There are two types of weapons in the game, the first time are your primary guns which are mounted on the ship you choose to use and cannot be changed. The second are missiles which you can choose before each mission and the number you can select depends on the number of hardpoints your chosen ship has.  Guns Projectie guns tend to have a limited amount of ammo. However the amount of ammo is usually so high that you would be hard pressed to use it all up. Energy weapons heat up the more you use them so eventually you have to let the cool down.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter Alpha 3 (known in some countries as Street Fighter Zero 3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on June 29, 1998.The third (and final) main installment of the Street Fighter Alpha trilogy (a spin-off Street Fighter series) and the sequel to Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3 features six new playable fighters (Blanka, E. Honda, and Vega from Street Fighter II, Cody from Final Fight, Sakura's schoolgirl rival Karin, and Japanese wrestler R. Mika), three new hidden fighters (Balrog from Street Fighter II and elite assassins Juli and Juni), new background stages, completely new music (with a different overarching style), new gameplay mechanics (such as a new throwing system, which is a now a separate button combination, and the \"Guard Crush\" system, which leaves players vulnerable if they block too much), and a new system of \"fighting styles\" (replacing the \"Normal/Auto\" system with three unique fighting styles, called \"Isms\", each with their own special abilities and traits).The game received numerous ports and updates since its first release, adding eight playable fighters (for a grand total of 36) and new game modes (most notably the World Tour mode, which allows players to build up their character in a single-player campaign). It is one of the few arcade games to receive multiple arcade versions on completely different hardware (CPS-2 and NAOMI). Gameplay[CR]Two different \"-isms\": A-ism on the left and V-ism on the rightThe game uses the standard Street Fighter control scheme featuring three kicks and three punches of varying strength and a joystick for movement and blocking. Special and super moves are performed by inputing specific combinations of attack buttons and joystick motions. The game also includes some basic recovery moves and some counters performed by precisely timed button presses and joystick motions.Fighting StylesMoving away from the \"Normal\" and \"Auto\" player modes, Street Fighter Alpha 3 introduced multiple fighting styles (called \"Isms\") for the player to choose from, each including their own Super Gauge system, special abilities, color schemes, and traits:Standard (A-ism/Z-ism)Returning from previous Street Fighter Alpha games, A-ism gives players a green three-level super gauge. Players with A-ism have the most options for Super Combos (including powerful Max Super Combos which take up the entire super gauge).Unlike previous games in the series, in which the level of the Super Combo is determined by the number of punch/kick buttons pressed, Street Fighter Alpha 3 allows players to determine which level of Super Combo to use based on the strength of the button pressed (Light for one level, Medium for two levels, and Heavy for all three levels).Variable (V-ism)Based on the Custom Combo system used in Street Fighter Alpha 2, V-ism gives players a simple blue super gauge (with a percentage indicator). While players cannot perform any Super Combo in this style, they can perform a Custom Combo by pressing two attack buttons of the same strength simultaneously (once they have at least 50% of their super gauge filled). While the Custom Combo is activated, players can perform a long sequence of quick combo chains (even if the opponent is being knocked down) as the super gauge depletes. The character leaves a shadow trail as Custom Combo is used (the gap between them being determined by the strength used to activate Custom Combo), with the last shadow's attack dealing additional damage. If the player is attacked while their Custom Combo is activated, it is disabled and the player loses up to 50% of their super gauge.While attacks dealt in V-ism deal less damage (and Alpha Counters take up 50% of the super gauge), players can determine the range of their attacks (Far Attacks vs. Close Attacks, usually determined by the distance between them and their opponent) based on the position of the joystick (creating some new mind-game opportunities and combo choices).Simple (X-ism)Similar to the system used in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, X-ism gives players a simple red super gauge. While they have less technical ability (such as being able to perform Air Blocks, Recovery Rolls, Alpha Counters, and Taunts) and less Super Combo options, as well as taking slightly more damage from attacks, players with X-ism can deal more damage from their attacks and can withstand more blocked attacks before getting Guard Crushed.Some direct changes to characters include changing Chun-Li's costume (to resemble her Street Fighter II appearance), Sodom's weapon (to a pair of katanas), Ryu's fireballs (to resemble the Street Fighter II version), and Gen's multiple styles (to one simple combination of both). Other characters have movelists changed to resemble their SSF2T counterparts (such as changing M. Bison's Psycho Shot projectile to the traditional Psycho Crusher attack and removing Ryu's fake fireball motion).The Final Boss version of M. Bison has a modified version of X-ism which gives him access to all technical abilities and Super Combo options in addition to his X-ism bonuses.Special ModesIn addition to the \"Ism\" system, players can use a cheat code prior to selecting a fighting style to get a secret modifier:Mazi - Damage taken and inflicted are increased. Cannot lose a single round.Saikyo - Attacks inflict less damage. Much easier to get dizzied and Guard Crushed. Cannot perform basic combos.Classic - Always use X-ism. Super Gauge, Super Combos, and Air Recovery disabled. Cannot be Guard Crushed.Game ModesWorld Tour (Console)In World Tour mode a player chooses a fighter and then levels up the fighter by winning stages set in different countries around a virtual map. Each spot on the map has different rules and different opponents for the player to overcome. After completing a stage a character earns experience points based on how well they performed in the stage. For instance, if a character were to perfect a fight he would gain more experience than if they ended the round with a sliver of health remaining. The character advances in level in two separate areas their overall level and their level in a specific \"-ism\". Every few levels a character receives bonus skills that allow for super meter regeneration or other nice additions. Depending on which of the three \"-isms\" the character has equipped they gain different skills that help boost their selected fighting style. A character also gains points that can be applied to raise offensive power or defensive power. However, for every point added there is also a point removed from the opposite stat. Advancing to the end of world tour mode unlocks Guile, Evil Ryu, and Shin Akuma as playable characters.Updates & Ports[CR]Since its original arcade release, the game received numerous updates on its home console versions (with some serving as the basis for an upgraded arcade port):The game was first ported to the PlayStation on December 23, 1998 (in Japan) and April 30, 1999 (in North America), adding four new playable fighters (Dee Jay, Fei Long, Guile, and T. Hawk, completing the cast of Street Fighter II), three unlockable variations (including Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma), and a new World Tour mode (in which players strengthen their character by leveling them up and granting them special buffs in a single-player campaign). The Japanese version also had use with the PocketStation. This port was digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on October 18, 2011 (in North America) and December 3, 2014 (in Japan).The PS1 version was later updated in a port to the Dreamcast on July 8, 1999 (in Japan as Street Fighter Zero 3: Saiko-ryu Dojo) and May 31, 2000 (in North America), changing its World Tour mode (and methods for unlocking some secret characters) while adding a new Saikyo Dojo mode (in which players download powerful AI opponents to fight with their World Tour characters and post the results online). A special mail-order version (titled Street Fighter Zero 3: Saiko-ryu Dojo for Matching Service) was released for Japan in 2001, adding online multiplayer.A separate update for the PlayStation version was the basis for a port to the Saturn (in Japan only) on August 6, 1999, changing the methods for unlocking some secret characters while revamping the Dramatic Battle mode.The Dreamcast version was used as the basis for Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper, a 2001 Japan-exclusive arcade port for the NAOMI hardware. Along with the added characters, this version allowed players to import their World Tour characters through a special VMU slot (in similar vein to the Japanese version of Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes).The game was ported by Crawfish to the Game Boy Advance on September 27, 2002 (in Japan) and December 1, 2002 (in North America). Stylized in-game as Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper (but released as Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper in Japan), this version includes all characters from the previous console versions and three new unlockable characters (Eagle, Maki, and Yun, all based on their Capcom Vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium appearances). However, the game does not include any bonus game modes added in previous console versions.The DC version was later updated in a port to the PlayStation Portable on January 19, 2006 (in Japan as Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper) and February 7, 2006 (in North America as Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX). Along with a variety of game modes (including various online multiplayer modes, and a new \"Vs. 100 Kumite\" mode) and the three additional characters from the GBA version (already unlocked), this version includes Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution.Both arcade versions (the \"Alpha 3 Upper\" version as a secret unlockable) are included in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation (released on June 13, 2006 for the PlayStation 2). In addition, the compilation has a secret unlockable \"Hyper Street Fighter Alpha\" game based on Street Fighter Alpha 3 (where players can pick earlier versions of characters for versus matches, including secret fighting modes loosely based on other Capcom fighting games).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game's original roster includes 28 playable fighters, nine of which are new additions. Four of them are brand new characters (Karin, R. Mika, Juli, and Juni), while three of them are hidden opponents playable with a cheat code (Balrog, Juli, and Juni).The console and Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper versions of the game added the remaining four characters from the Street Fighter II series (totaling at 32 playable fighters) and two character variations (Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma). The GBA version adds three additional unlockable fighters from Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium while the PSP version adds Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution (bringing the total roster to 36).Because of the X-ism fighting style, there are no longer hidden Super Street Fighter II Turbo variants for some characters. Other than Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma, Balrog has a hidden unlockable variation in the console versions while M. Bison has a \"Final\" variation used as the game's final boss (unplayable in the arcade version, unlocked in most console versions).New CharactersKarinR.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter III 3rd StrikeIn 1999, following the release of Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact for the arcades, Capcom released their third and final iteration of the Street Fighter III series titled Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike - Fight for the Future. 3rd Strike brought back Chun-Li from Street Fighter II, along with four new characters. 3rd Strike differs from the first two games as it features a soundtrack composed by Hideki Okugawa influenced by hip-hop, jazz, and drum and bass music. It also has updated design, gameplay tweaks, new stages, and new ending sequences.3rd Strike was primarily developed for Capcom's CPS3 arcade hardware, but multiple console ports soon followed for Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox. An updated version of the game was later released on PSN and XBLA as \"Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Online Edition\". [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]3rd Strike Select ScreenAside from Shin Akuma, every character from previous Street Fighter III iterations including Ryu, Alex, and Yun make a return to 3rd Strike. New characters include Street Fighter II's Chun-Li, Rindoukan karate practitioner Makoto, French vagrant Remy, biological weapon and shape-shifter Twelve and the mysterious Q.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of the game is to deplete a opponent's vitality meter before the times runs out. If players deplete their meters at the same time, it will result in double KO giving both a round win. If the round ends in a draw, the match will be determined by performance of both players.After every three matches in arcade mode, players can partake in bonus stages. Introduced in 2nd Impact, players can parry multiple basketballs thrown by Sean and the car crushing mode from Final Fight is here.3rd Strike also features special fight introductions that replace the normal ones in specific matchups. For example, the classic fist bump between close friends Ryu and Ken appears in 3rd Strike. Another one takes place between Alex and Hugo, where they have a bit of a stand-off with each other before Hugo bumps Alex a foot away from him; a nod to the Hulk Hogan vs Andre the Giant fight from WrestleMania III.Parry defenseParrying is a significant technical addition to the Street Fighter III series (referred in the Japanese version as \"blocking\"; in Japan blocking an attack is referred as \"guarding\") where players must react by pressing forward (for a high attack) or down (for a low attack) an opponent's attack to deflect as well as receive no damage if an attack depletes vitality when blocked. When performed, this renders the opponent defenseless for a counterattack. New to 3rd Strike is the \"Guard Parry\" where players can parry during their \"Guard Stun\" stance creating a red visual effect instead of the usual blue.3rd Strike also broadened the timing window to perform a parry, reducing the risk of a parry and increasing its accessibility to new players.Parrying allows both players to instantly wrest control of the fight's momentum, moving it away from excessive \"sitting in the corner and blocking\" and \"attacking relentlessly\" that hinders most fighting games' restrictive combat flow. The lure of a parry's potential success or failure, offers the attacking and defending players myriad options for mind games, since at any time the player's attack can be used against the player.Super artsSimilar to the \"Super Combo\" systems in Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter Alpha series , Street Fighter III uses a powerful special move system referred to as \"Super Arts.\" While other Street Fighter games allows players to access multiple supers with one meter, every character throughout the III series has three unique Super Arts which players can pick only one when fighting their opponent (while Akuma can use two hidden additional Super Arts giving players a total of three combined with a chosen main).Aside from their effects, each Super Art has different properties including the number of bar stocks it can hold and its meter length. These properties can also determine if players can use more powerful special moves known as \"EX Moves.\" Introduced in 2nd Impact, EX Moves requires players to perform the same motion as they would with a normal special move but with an additional attack button simultaneously. A player's character will flash yellow to indicate that an EX move has executed. EX Moves can only be performed when the Super Art meter fills a certain portion indicated with flashing.ThrowingThe command for throwing has changed requiring the player to press both light punch and kick buttons at the same time while previously throughout the Street Fighter franchise required only one button press. \"Grapple defense\" (or technical throws) return from 2nd Impact allowing players to escape an enemy throw by also performing a throw command.Leap attackingStreet Fighter III: New Generation introduced \"leap attacks\" which allows players to perform small jumping attacks against crouched opponents has also received a command change; now performed with pressing both strong punch and kick buttons simultaneously.TauntingTaunting, or \"Personal Action,\" available in 2nd Impact returned in 3rd Strike. Players can access taunts by simultaneously pressing both fierce punch and kick buttons at the same time. Each character's taunt is also accompanied by an additional benefit if completed successfully; for example, Ryu's taunt will lower his stun gauge, whereas Q's taunt raises his maximum stamina.Grading and JudgementAfter every match, both winner and loser receive a grade on how they performed. Many aspects of the system include offense, defense, technical, and extra points. This can be used to help pick a winner in the \"Judgement System\" where if the match ends in a draw, the Judgement System can calculate who has done better in the match.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Two soundtracks of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike have been released. The first version was based on the original music from the arcade builds of 3rd Strike while the successor was an arranged version from the console releases. The soundtracks were composed by Hideki Okugawa with contributions by Canadian hip-hop rapper Infinite.Original Japanese Soundtrack CoverAlex & Ken's stage, \"Jazzy NYC'99\"Necro & Twelve's stage, \"Snowland\"Hugo's stage, \"The Circuit\"Chun-Li's stage, \"China Vox\"Ryu's stage, \"Kobu\"Ibuki's stage, \"Twilight\"Makoto's stage, \"Spunky\"Akuma's stage, \"Killing Moon\"Elena's stage, \"Beat in my Head\"Sean & Oro's stage, \"The Longshorehan\"Dudley's stage, \"You Blow my Mind\"Yun & Yang's stage, \"Crowded Street\"Remy's stage, \"The Beep\"Q's theme, \"Q\"Urien's stage, \"Crazy Chili Dog\"Gill's stage, \"Psych Out\"[CR]Online Edition[CR]Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online EditionAt the San Diego Comic-Con International 2010, Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online Edition was informally announced, although platform(s) of choice were not given. At the time it was noted that \"Now that we've announced it, the company can't stop us\", said the game's producer Yoshinori Ono. The following months had Ono tease various pictures of the game including main menu layout as well as the graphics. More information would be announced in E3 2011 revealing its many features.Developed by Iron Galaxy Studios for the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Network, 3rd Strike Online Edition is an arcade perfect build of the game while grabbing some aspects of the console versions.The online fights make use of the GGPO netcode system which uses a latency-hiding technique called \"rollbacking\" where it identifies both player's actions and instantly examines which motion was correct before proceeding. Players can view and upload replays in the game as well as YouTube. 3rd Strike Online Edition also features a lobby system able to hold up to eight players with capability of playing each other as well as watching other matches outside the lobby. A version of arcade style quarter matches is also available online.Based on the 990512 arcade build, 3rd Strike Online Edition retains some various unblockable techniques but removes some game breaking glitches. Console version elements such as a mode that can modify the gameplay and special character color palettes return. None of the characters have been rebalanced for 3rd Strike Online Edition. Players can practice in various training modes including the default option as well as special parrying trials.Players can play the game in various graphical settings. They can configure the aspect ratio with the normal 4:3 position to being stretched. 3rd Strike Online Edition also features toggle able graphical filters and even scanline capabilities.Another aspect included is its challenge system. Players can achieve special challenges which can score vault points. The vault points can be used to unlock character concept art, fan submitted art, character music, videos and other content.[CR]Useful links[CR]TheShend - Youtube channel with tons of high level match videos and tutorials.Agtool - Youtube channel with highlight videos.[CR]",

The compilation was released in 2000 for the Dreamcast.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game takes place four years after the events of Street Fighter II. With the defeat of M. Bison and the Shadowloo organization, a new threat rises to power. A religious cult known as the Illuminati who are bent on restoring balance to the world by using terrorist tactics such as: kidnapping, DNA manipulation, and brainwashing. The leader of the Illuminati and the boss of Street Fighter III is a self-proclaimed god named Gill. With a strong belief that the world is going to end, Gill organizes the third World Warrior tournament in hopes of finding the strongest fighters to repopulating the world after it ends.[CR]Street Fighter III: New Generation[CR]The first Street Fighter III was released in 1997 in the arcades. The game features nine brand new characters with two returning characters from the previous games - Ryu and Ken.[CR]Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant Attack[CR]Released just months after New Generation, 2nd Impact: Giant Attack adds more characters and stages and new gameplay features to the game.Another returning character from Street Fighter II, Akuma, joins the cast; along with two new characters to the series, Gill's younger brother, Urien, and Hugo. Yang, who was just a pallet swap of Yun, is now giving his own exclusive moves.Characters who shared music themes and stages in the first game, like Ken sharing a stage with Ryu, where now given thier own stage and theme.Existing characters' moves and combo variations have been altered in 2nd Impact. For example, Yun can now combo weak punch, weak kick, and medium punch; which is something he couldn't do in New Generation.2nd Impact also gives the bonus stage its own mode to be played at any giving time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]New Generation.Like many other Capcom fighting games, Street Fighter III uses six buttons; which are three versions of punch and kick - weak, medium, and fierce. Street Fighter III introduces new gameplay features, some of them coming from other Capcom fighting games.The most noticeable feature of the game is the parry mechanic. It's a gameplay feature that allows the player to parry any attack by pressing forward (High attacks) or down (Low attacks) on the joystick, or D-pad. The parry is use to avoid chip damage which is something that the player suffers when the player decides to block an attack.

(Urien is only selectable in 2nd Impact).\"Urien is designed to play exactly like Gill, but tone down. He has the power to control electricity and metal. Urien is very jealous about Gill being the President of the Illmunati, a position that truly wants.Urien finally gets what he wants, he begins thinking about greatly his new found power is going to be. But then Urien finds out that the reason why he was promoted is due to the fact that Gill was promoted to emperor.Winning Quotes:\"I will not forgive anyone who tries to oppose me!\"\"Writhe in agony!

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter Alpha 3 (known in some countries as Street Fighter Zero 3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on June 29, 1998.The third (and final) main installment of the Street Fighter Alpha trilogy (a spin-off Street Fighter series) and the sequel to Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3 features six new playable fighters (Blanka, E. Honda, and Vega from Street Fighter II, Cody from Final Fight, Sakura's schoolgirl rival Karin, and Japanese wrestler R. Mika), three new hidden fighters (Balrog from Street Fighter II and elite assassins Juli and Juni), new background stages, completely new music (with a different overarching style), new gameplay mechanics (such as a new throwing system, which is a now a separate button combination, and the \"Guard Crush\" system, which leaves players vulnerable if they block too much), and a new system of \"fighting styles\" (replacing the \"Normal/Auto\" system with three unique fighting styles, called \"Isms\", each with their own special abilities and traits).The game received numerous ports and updates since its first release, adding eight playable fighters (for a grand total of 36) and new game modes (most notably the World Tour mode, which allows players to build up their character in a single-player campaign). It is one of the few arcade games to receive multiple arcade versions on completely different hardware (CPS-2 and NAOMI). Gameplay[CR]Two different \"-isms\": A-ism on the left and V-ism on the rightThe game uses the standard Street Fighter control scheme featuring three kicks and three punches of varying strength and a joystick for movement and blocking. Special and super moves are performed by inputing specific combinations of attack buttons and joystick motions. The game also includes some basic recovery moves and some counters performed by precisely timed button presses and joystick motions.Fighting StylesMoving away from the \"Normal\" and \"Auto\" player modes, Street Fighter Alpha 3 introduced multiple fighting styles (called \"Isms\") for the player to choose from, each including their own Super Gauge system, special abilities, color schemes, and traits:Standard (A-ism/Z-ism)Returning from previous Street Fighter Alpha games, A-ism gives players a green three-level super gauge. Players with A-ism have the most options for Super Combos (including powerful Max Super Combos which take up the entire super gauge).Unlike previous games in the series, in which the level of the Super Combo is determined by the number of punch/kick buttons pressed, Street Fighter Alpha 3 allows players to determine which level of Super Combo to use based on the strength of the button pressed (Light for one level, Medium for two levels, and Heavy for all three levels).Variable (V-ism)Based on the Custom Combo system used in Street Fighter Alpha 2, V-ism gives players a simple blue super gauge (with a percentage indicator). While players cannot perform any Super Combo in this style, they can perform a Custom Combo by pressing two attack buttons of the same strength simultaneously (once they have at least 50% of their super gauge filled). While the Custom Combo is activated, players can perform a long sequence of quick combo chains (even if the opponent is being knocked down) as the super gauge depletes. The character leaves a shadow trail as Custom Combo is used (the gap between them being determined by the strength used to activate Custom Combo), with the last shadow's attack dealing additional damage. If the player is attacked while their Custom Combo is activated, it is disabled and the player loses up to 50% of their super gauge.While attacks dealt in V-ism deal less damage (and Alpha Counters take up 50% of the super gauge), players can determine the range of their attacks (Far Attacks vs. Close Attacks, usually determined by the distance between them and their opponent) based on the position of the joystick (creating some new mind-game opportunities and combo choices).Simple (X-ism)Similar to the system used in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, X-ism gives players a simple red super gauge. While they have less technical ability (such as being able to perform Air Blocks, Recovery Rolls, Alpha Counters, and Taunts) and less Super Combo options, as well as taking slightly more damage from attacks, players with X-ism can deal more damage from their attacks and can withstand more blocked attacks before getting Guard Crushed.Some direct changes to characters include changing Chun-Li's costume (to resemble her Street Fighter II appearance), Sodom's weapon (to a pair of katanas), Ryu's fireballs (to resemble the Street Fighter II version), and Gen's multiple styles (to one simple combination of both). Other characters have movelists changed to resemble their SSF2T counterparts (such as changing M. Bison's Psycho Shot projectile to the traditional Psycho Crusher attack and removing Ryu's fake fireball motion).The Final Boss version of M. Bison has a modified version of X-ism which gives him access to all technical abilities and Super Combo options in addition to his X-ism bonuses.Special ModesIn addition to the \"Ism\" system, players can use a cheat code prior to selecting a fighting style to get a secret modifier:Mazi - Damage taken and inflicted are increased. Cannot lose a single round.Saikyo - Attacks inflict less damage. Much easier to get dizzied and Guard Crushed. Cannot perform basic combos.Classic - Always use X-ism. Super Gauge, Super Combos, and Air Recovery disabled. Cannot be Guard Crushed.Game ModesWorld Tour (Console)In World Tour mode a player chooses a fighter and then levels up the fighter by winning stages set in different countries around a virtual map. Each spot on the map has different rules and different opponents for the player to overcome. After completing a stage a character earns experience points based on how well they performed in the stage. For instance, if a character were to perfect a fight he would gain more experience than if they ended the round with a sliver of health remaining. The character advances in level in two separate areas their overall level and their level in a specific \"-ism\". Every few levels a character receives bonus skills that allow for super meter regeneration or other nice additions. Depending on which of the three \"-isms\" the character has equipped they gain different skills that help boost their selected fighting style. A character also gains points that can be applied to raise offensive power or defensive power. However, for every point added there is also a point removed from the opposite stat. Advancing to the end of world tour mode unlocks Guile, Evil Ryu, and Shin Akuma as playable characters.Updates & Ports[CR]Since its original arcade release, the game received numerous updates on its home console versions (with some serving as the basis for an upgraded arcade port):The game was first ported to the PlayStation on December 23, 1998 (in Japan) and April 30, 1999 (in North America), adding four new playable fighters (Dee Jay, Fei Long, Guile, and T. Hawk, completing the cast of Street Fighter II), three unlockable variations (including Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma), and a new World Tour mode (in which players strengthen their character by leveling them up and granting them special buffs in a single-player campaign). The Japanese version also had use with the PocketStation. This port was digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on October 18, 2011 (in North America) and December 3, 2014 (in Japan).The PS1 version was later updated in a port to the Dreamcast on July 8, 1999 (in Japan as Street Fighter Zero 3: Saiko-ryu Dojo) and May 31, 2000 (in North America), changing its World Tour mode (and methods for unlocking some secret characters) while adding a new Saikyo Dojo mode (in which players download powerful AI opponents to fight with their World Tour characters and post the results online). A special mail-order version (titled Street Fighter Zero 3: Saiko-ryu Dojo for Matching Service) was released for Japan in 2001, adding online multiplayer.A separate update for the PlayStation version was the basis for a port to the Saturn (in Japan only) on August 6, 1999, changing the methods for unlocking some secret characters while revamping the Dramatic Battle mode.The Dreamcast version was used as the basis for Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper, a 2001 Japan-exclusive arcade port for the NAOMI hardware. Along with the added characters, this version allowed players to import their World Tour characters through a special VMU slot (in similar vein to the Japanese version of Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes).The game was ported by Crawfish to the Game Boy Advance on September 27, 2002 (in Japan) and December 1, 2002 (in North America). Stylized in-game as Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper (but released as Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper in Japan), this version includes all characters from the previous console versions and three new unlockable characters (Eagle, Maki, and Yun, all based on their Capcom Vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium appearances). However, the game does not include any bonus game modes added in previous console versions.The DC version was later updated in a port to the PlayStation Portable on January 19, 2006 (in Japan as Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper) and February 7, 2006 (in North America as Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX). Along with a variety of game modes (including various online multiplayer modes, and a new \"Vs. 100 Kumite\" mode) and the three additional characters from the GBA version (already unlocked), this version includes Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution.Both arcade versions (the \"Alpha 3 Upper\" version as a secret unlockable) are included in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation (released on June 13, 2006 for the PlayStation 2). In addition, the compilation has a secret unlockable \"Hyper Street Fighter Alpha\" game based on Street Fighter Alpha 3 (where players can pick earlier versions of characters for versus matches, including secret fighting modes loosely based on other Capcom fighting games).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game's original roster includes 28 playable fighters, nine of which are new additions. Four of them are brand new characters (Karin, R. Mika, Juli, and Juni), while three of them are hidden opponents playable with a cheat code (Balrog, Juli, and Juni).The console and Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper versions of the game added the remaining four characters from the Street Fighter II series (totaling at 32 playable fighters) and two character variations (Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma). The GBA version adds three additional unlockable fighters from Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium while the PSP version adds Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution (bringing the total roster to 36).Because of the X-ism fighting style, there are no longer hidden Super Street Fighter II Turbo variants for some characters. Other than Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma, Balrog has a hidden unlockable variation in the console versions while M. Bison has a \"Final\" variation used as the game's final boss (unplayable in the arcade version, unlocked in most console versions).New CharactersKarinR.

It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums.  Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.[CR]You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.[CR]There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick.  It's something like the VR missions in the Metal Gear series.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Sword of the Berserk: Guts\u2019 Rage is a 3D hack & slash game for the Dreamcast. The game is based on the popular manga and anime series Berserk, written by Kentaro Miura. The game was developed by Yuke\u2019s Co. Ltd and published in Japan by ASCII Corporation and in the rest of the world by Eidos Interactive. The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1999, in the United States on February 29, 2000 and in Europe on May 19, 2001. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens up with a cutscene depicting a group of traveling performers getting ambushed by bandits. After some brief dialogue the eponymous hero of the game, Guts, shows up and takes care of the bandits. Afterwards you are introduced to Guts, his lover Casca, his sidekick Puck and the travelling performer Rita. Guts and his company decide to head to the next town, once there they learn about a plant called the Mandragora which when attached to someone, turns its hosts into zombie-like creatures. There they meet the ruler of the town and kingdom, Baron Balzac.Baron Balzac tells them that he believes he has found a cure for the Mandragoran plague. He tells of a great tree and its heart which is the proposed cure. To save Casca, Gus agrees to travel to the tree and cut out its heart. [CR]Characters  [CR]Guts: Guts is one of only two people to survive the solar eclipse massacre at the mercy of the God Hand\u2019s minions. He now wanders the world seeking revenge against them, armed with the mighty Dragon Slayer sword.Guts was branded with a mark as he fled the God Hand\u2019s massacre. The brand serves as a tracking device for the God Hand, but it also forewarns of danger and imparts Guts\u2019 Berserk rage. It will change and bleed as God Hand draws nearer or when the minions perform a human sacrifice.Casca: Once, Casca was the feared leader of the Hawks. But the God Hand\u2019s massacre left her so severely traumatized that it drove her to madness. Her total recovery is in doubt. Only Guts\u2019 love may save her.Puck: Puck is Guts\u2019 diminutive fairy partner. By nature cheerful and easily elated, Puck is a valuable elfin friend.Rita: Rita is a traveling performer, perhaps of gypsy descent. An adept knife handler, she learned this talent as part of her performance. This fascinating street-artist is a strong-willed ally.Baron Balzac: Baron Balzac is the tyrannical ruler of the Kingdom infested by Mandragora\u2019s minions. He is wise and strong, but his motives are clouded. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Like many other third-person action games you control your character and go around killing enemies to progress through linear levels. There are basic combos in the game that are mixed up through a horizontal attack and vertical attack. Besides his sword, Guts also uses throwing knives, a hand cannon, grenades and a hand-held crossbow. These secondary weapons are powerful but use limited ammunition; except the throwing knives and hand-held crossbow. These weapons are utilized in a format similar to the quick menu system used in Phantasy Star Online: press the trigger and you\u2019ll have access to these secondary weapons.Guts has a health bar as well as a meter that builds up with every successful hit and when full, Guts enters Berserk mode in which his attacks are stronger, he moves faster and is temporarily invulnerable. In Berserk mode, Guts also has the ability to swing his sword through walls. This is a major advantage in cramped setting as Guts' sword is eight feet long making fighting in hallways and corridors very hard. Throughout the game you will have to perform quick-time events, from jumping over a falling bridge to dodging falling rubble.There are save points in the game but there are very few, about five throughout the game. You also have a limited number of lives that differ between difficulty levels: seven for easy, ten for normal and thirteen for the hard. [CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sydney 2000 was the official video game tie-in of the Summer Olympic Games hosted by Sydney, Australia in the year 2000.  It was developed by ATD, published by Eidos and was released on the PC, Playstation and Dreamcast.  It was the follow up game to the Olympic Summer Games: Atlanta '96 and was the first Olympics video game to be released on 32-bit consoles.  It got mostly positive reviews in the press and sold remarkably well for an Olympic tie-in.  It recieved the BAFTA award of \"Sports Game of the Year 2000\" because of this.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Much like previous Olympic Games video games, button mashing is the main style of gameplay involved.  Two face buttons are used for power and a third face button used for actions like jumping a hurdle, throwing the javelin, etc.  All of the track and field events use this style of gameplay while other events like the 10m Platform Dive, which uses a rythem click the right button in a sequence style of gameplay, Skeet Shooting and K1 Kayak Slalom use different control schemes.  The Chase Cycling event also requires a slightly different approach as you have to pace yourself throughout the early laps so that your rider on the final lap isn't too tired to perform well in the final Sprint section of the race.There are 4 different game modes in Sydney 2000.  Olympic Mode which is the main game mode, Arcade Mode where you take on each event in order, Training Mode where you can practice any of the events to hone your skills and Head to Head Mode were you and another player can pit your Olympic Mode athletes against each other.The main Olympic Games mode was radically changed in this game to closer represent the Olympic Qualifying tour.  You can choose to represent one of 32 countries over 12 events but rather than see your athlete start out at the Olympic Games you have to qualify for each event by going through 3 qualifying stages first.  Each event has the same 4 stages: -The Open Trials The Initiation Event The Championships The Olympic Class  For each stage you have to complete a series of training mini-games which take place in the \"Cyber Gym\".  The Cyber Gym mini games, which look a lot like the new Madden IQ mode in style, range from running on a treadmill, sit ups and squats to things like reaction training and are tied into one of 3 attributes for each event.  Completing a Cyber Gym mini game will raise your athletes stats temporarily.  When you are happy with the athletes atributes you can then try to advance to the next stage by competing against CPU players of your skill level.Although its perfectly possible to win the Olympic Class event without doing any of the training mini games for that level, the task is made substantially easier by completing every mini game to 100% before hand.  As they game relys more on the athlete atributes than the actual players button presses, athletes which are at 100% can easily smash the world record without too much effort.[CR]Events[CR]100m Sprint 110m Hurdles Javelin* Hammer Triple Jump High Jump* Skeet Shooting Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting 100m Freestyle Swimming* 10m Platform Diving* Chase Cycling Kayak K1 Slalom  * denotes an event where a female player model is used.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tech Romancer is a 1 on 1 fighting game in the same vein as King of the Monsters: the player controls a massive fighter that squares off against another fighter with the environment that the two battle in taking damage as the combatants are hurled around. The game features a simple combat system that consists of a light attack, which can be comboed together, and a heavy attack, which is ranged for most of the chracters, and each of the robots represents a different \"giant fighting robot\" genre from Japanese culture. In that sense, the game is a sort of VS game for fans of giant robot media. The game also features finishing moves that are similar to Mortal Kombat's trademarked Fatalities, except that they can be called up in the final round of combat when an opponent has very little health left. The moves are avoidable, however, and can only be attempted once, making them more like Guilty Gear's DESTRUCTION moves. In addition, the game has a block button, and each mech has an armor rating. As blocking is used more, the armor meter decreases, until it eventually depletes and blocking now merely reduces damage instead of stopping it altogether. This promotes a more aggressive play style as a mech with destroyed armor will take more damage with or without a block. The game is also unique for fighting games, especially at the time, because each character had a specific story mode that brought them not only into battle against most of the other mechs from the game, as well as three \"boss\" mechs at the end, but many stories had branching paths that would be triggered if certain conditions were met during a given battle.[CR]Combat[CR]Two mechs enter, one mech survives. The combat in Tech Romancer is simple on the surface, but can become quite complex with the addition of guard breaks, super moves, dashes, and 3D evasion. There are even items that will be revealed when prominent buildings are destroyed. These can give the effects of healing, powering up, or activating Hero Mode, in which the mech will have access to new moves and abilities for a short time.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Tech Romancer, as mentioned above, features characters from the Giant Fighting Robot genre of Japanese television and movies.Armour Knight G (Grand) Kaiser: A superhero type mech in the same vein as Mazinger Z, G. Kaiser attacks using rocket punches, bombs and a chest mounted laser beam. It is piloted by the hot-headed Junpei Todoroki (voiced by K\u014dichi T\u014dchika) who seeks justice for the death of his family.Super Defense Armour Dixen: Representing the \"real robot\" mech type made famous by the numerous Gundam series and piloted either by Nakato Farland (voiced by Shigeru Nakahara) or Halma Flockheart (voiced by Yoshino Takamori) (only matters in Story Mode), Dixen is an extremely versatile mech that can switch between a beam rifle and a bazooka. It is also armed with a shoulder-mounted beam cannon, grenades and three remote-controlled beam guns to meet many different situations. Also has a variant piloted by Shadow Red.Pulsion: A \"living robot\" that mimics the likes of Ultraman and his many spin-offs, Pulsion is not piloted, but actually IS either the male Kai (voiced by Takehito Koyasu) or female Kei (voiced by Miki Nagasawa) (once again only mattering in the story mode) grown to massive proportions and endowed with a new form. Pulsion was originally sent to Earth by Goldibus to destroy it but wound up having his/her memory erased in a battle with Diana-17. In Hero Mode, Pulsion's fighting style changes to resemble Evangelion Unit 01 in it's Berserk Mode. A evil version of Pulsion named Dark Pulsion can also be unlocked.Strategic Variable Fighter Rafaga: A robot that can transform from it's GERWALK and/or Soldier (mecha) mode to a jet fighter. It is heavily inspired by the VF-1 Valkyries from Super Dimensional Fortress Macross. Piloted by, ladies' man, Simon Harvard (voiced by Takehito Koyasu) who falls in love with the alien pilot Yale. A variant of Rafaga can also be unlocked that is piloted by Amuritta, Simon's more professional wingman who harbours a small crush on him.Phantasm Unit Twinzam V: A super robot, based on the combining robot genre of anime like Getter Robo, that is actually made up of two aircraft that combine together and can switch between two forms. It is piloted by 10-year-old Daichi Yumeno (voiced by Rica Matsumoto) and his 11-year-old sister Sora (voiced by Mayumi Iizuka) who enter this world through shared dreams and become trapped by Arekshim, pilot of Gamda.The Messenger of Beauty and Justice Diana-17: An agile female-styled fighting mecha that is piloted by Reika Amamiya (voiced by Michiko Neya), a student at a girls' academy and secret super hero, who is initially the first person to learn of Goldibus' invasion plot. She spends the game trying to rally the other heroes.Heavy Armour Tank Wise Duck: A heavily armed, slow moving, bipedal tank who bears a resemblance to Metal Gear Solid's Metal Gear Rex. It is piloted by an entire crew consisting of Gonzales (Commander) (voiced by Daisuke G\u014dri), Arvin (Combat) (voiced by Shigeri Nakahara), Ricky (Gunner) (voiced by K\u014dichi T\u014dchika), Thomas (Pilot) (voiced by Takehito Koyasu) and Herman (Sonar/Communications) (voiced by Sh\u016bichi Ikeda). Wise duck also has a variant piloted by Shadow Red.Magical Patched Robot Bolon: A robot made out of parts of several buildings. It is the creation of Pollialm \"Pollin\" De Pollintein (voiced by Satomi Koorogi), a magical girl who appears only 8 years old, though she can age herself to be about 17. She has a crush on Junpei and is also actually the daughter of Goldibus.Mariou Shogun Gourai: A massive red, Samurai-style mecha, that fights using a giant sword. Piloted by Shadow Red who, at first seems to be a general in Goldibus' army, has an agenda of his own. He is somehow connected to to Junpei and is seen as Nakato's rival during his story. His appearance and story is inspired by Char Aznable (both voiced by Shuichi Ikeda).Variant Armour Blodia II Custom: An unlockable robot piloted by Jin Saotome (voiced by Y\u016bji Ueda). They are the main characters from Armored Warriors and Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness.Quvearl: An Octopus-like bio-contruct that is controlled by the female alien Yale.Gamda: A massive kaijuu-like stone golem controlled by Arekshim (voiced by Ry\u016bsei Nakao), an alien ruler who has allied himself with Goldibus. He has an Egyptian theme.Goldibus: The main antagonist of the game. He has two forms that must both be defeated to beat the game.Voiced by Chikao \u014ctsuka.[CR]",

                "plot": "Tee Off Golf is a surprisingly satisfying sleeper hit golf game for the Dreamcast from the folks at Bottom Up. Although it does not have the realism of lets say, the \"Tiger Woods\" series, it still holds up pretty well without real life professional golfers. The cartoon-like characters and overly obscure body models seem to work quite well with its overall loose and subtle comical tone. Tee Off never takes itself too seriously. For example, the quirky comments after a hole in one or when simply hitting the ball vary from character to character. Not only are the characters physically distinct from one another, but also have vocal distinctions. Each character has a special tone of voice that matches the characters age, and possibly social status. For example, Randy, has a brute voice that reflects his muscular appearance, but also has a gentle softness that finishes smoothly with each word of dialogue.                  The campaign allows the player to tour the world in five different locales: Japan, Australia, Africa, USA, and Scotland. Each course has a full eighteen hole set with plenty of opportunities for eagles, birdies, and hole-in-ones. The gameplay is very simple, which is a positive. Aim, hit the A button to place a set power percentage, then hit A again as close and as parallel as you can to match the accuracy bar. You can also spin the ball and choose different clubs, but the game defaults to a preferred club every time before a swing. Putting works the same way.         Aside from the tour mode, there's free mode, and more interesting the Gate ball mode. It is essentially a futuristic croquet. Multiplayer in Tee Off works quite well. You are not required to use four separate controllers to play four player split screen, you can actually use one controller for two different human players. The first try for a golf game on the Dreamcast is a worthy effort.                  Character roster is large and has many unlockables including some hidden characters. [CR]",

One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player.

The video game shares many themes with the novel, including a heavy emphasis on terrorism and anti-terrorism, covert operations, and international politics. Rainbow Six has been ported to many consoles following its original PC release. Depending on the console, Rainbow Six is played in either a first-person or third-person perspective, allowing players to take the role of a covert anti-terrorist heading into action and giving commands to teammates in order to tactically defeat the enemy. The PC version was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment, except in Europe where it was published by Ubisoft.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Team Rainbow is an elite international group of anti-terrorist experts, covertly sent on missions around the world in an attempt to smother out the flames of rising terrorism. The team is often assigned hostage rescue missions from director John Clark, during the course of which Rainbow is alerted to the actions of a radial terrorist organization the Phoenix Group. During several mission infiltrating the many bases of operation for the Phoenix Group, team Rainbow successfully gathers intelligence from the Phoenix Group\u2019s biological research facility. It is revealed that the terrorist organization is planning to unleash a biological weapon at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Team Rainbow immediately prepares to infiltrate the large underground network of the Olympic Village, seeking the location of the weapon, and thwarting the Phoenix Group\u2019s plans. The Rainbow Team concludes it\u2019s mission against the Phoenix Group by entering the group\u2019s main facilities, resembling an ecosphere for botanical and viral research. Team Rainbow successfully incapacitates the enemy leader, taking out a major threat to world peace.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The gameplay in Rainbow Six forces players to strictly plan each mission, examining every tactical angle before thrown into action. Levels are prefaced with briefings that provide the player with a map of the area, suspected locations of terrorists and hostages, and entry and exit points. The player is encouraged to plot their own waypoints on the map, while choosing different alert status for the team (i.e, \u201cescort\u201d or \u201cengage\u201d). However, stock execution plans are available in the player chooses to bypass the planning stage. Four teams are at disposal to the player, one of which is in direct control through either first person or third person view. Sixteen individual members comprise Rainbow Six, each of which can be either promoted or assigned to different color coded teams, such as Gold, Red, Blue and Green. Once the mission has begun, players have access to the wide range of weapons chose during planning. For example, flashbangs temporarily debilitate enemies, which is the player\u2019s advantage when approaching guarded hostages. The player also has the ability to advance other teams in the field, either by switching the control and view to a different colored team, or executing Go-Codes such as \u201cAdvance\u201d or \u201cHold Position.\u201d When a team member of Rainbow is incapacitated by the enemy, vital signs display the status of the downed member. If a member has been killed, he or she will be unavailable for the roster for the remainder of the game. Incapacitated members must wait to recover at least one following mission before returning to action.  [CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR] Rainbow Six is notable for it\u2019s online multiplayer during a time when internet gaming was in its early stages. Many maps were multiplayer specific for the PC, such as City Street Large, a training level.  Multiplayer on the console was limited to split screen co-op gameplay. Each player controlled one of the colored Rainbow teams, coordinating infiltration of dangerous areas and evacuation of multiple hostages.   [CR]Different Versions[CR] The Nintendo 64 version made use of nearly every button on the controller, forcing players to constantly switch between the middle and left handle. Aiming was controlled with the analog stick, for example, while reloading was designated to the left shoulder button. The Nintendo 64 version received both criticism and praise for this control scheme, as critics cited the layout\u2019s awkwardness, while the positive reviews noted a parallel to real world actions. It was developed by Saffire. The Dreamcast version was developed by Pipe Dream Interactive and published by Majesco. The Game Boy Color version was developed by Crawfish Interactive and published by South Peak.

The subtitle \"Rogue Spear\" refers to the possession of nuclear weapons by a non-state entity.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Rogue Spear's multiplayer was playable on 3 different networks: GameSpy Arcade, MSN Gaming Zone, and Mplayer.com (which was later intergrated into GameSpy Arcade). The multiplayer game achieved a certain degree of success, boasting several thousand players playing at once. After the acquisition of MPlayer.com by GameSpy Arcade, MSN Games became the more popular of the two until Microsoft shut down the MSN Gaming Zone's CD-ROM match-making service on June 19, 2006. As of the shutdown of Gamespy's servers on May 31st 2014, there is no longer any official multiplayer support for Rogue Spear. Rogue Spear also featured a ranking system called ladder play. Several websites provided this service throughout the game's lifespan, with the four most notable being Clanladder (CL), Xtreme Gaming Network (XGN), Starlance (SL) and International Gaming Syndicate (IGN). While all of these websites provided a ranking system, they also provided anti-cheat applications developed by the staff and community. More notably, SL and IGN both employed anti-cheat squads that would pose as players and monitor the playstyles of suspected cheaters. Their findings would often result in the banning and deletion of offenders from the ladder system. [CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]The game featured single player Campaign, Training, and Terrorist Hunt modes, and two online game modes: Team Deathmatch and 1v1. The game also featured a Replay mode, allowing players to save and watch clips of single player missions. [CR]Expansions[CR] Urban OperationsRogue Spear's first expansion was released on April 4, 2000. It added eight new maps and five maps from the original Rainbow Six game, as well as 3 new weapons.  Covert Ops EssentialsCovert Ops Essentials was released on September 28, 2000, as an educational program on real life counter-terrorism history and tactics. It included nine new missions.  Black ThornRogue Spear's final expansion was released on December 15, 2001. Like the previous expansion, Black Thorn featured nine new single-player missions.[CR]",

The first game in the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brings real skateboarders (such as Tony Hawk and Bob Burnquist), signature skateboarding brands (including real skateboard decals), and easier accessibility into the scarcely-populated skateboarding video game genre.The game was ported to the Nintendo 64 on February 29, 2000 (ported by Edge of Reality and published by Activision), the Dreamcast on June 29, 2000 (ported by Treyarch and published by Crave), and the N-Gage on October 23, 2003 (ported by Ideaworks and published by Nokia). The Nintendo 64 version is known for its censorship of both blood and vulgar song lyrics (granting it an \"E\" rating by the ESRB, as opposed to the original \"T\" rating). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is included in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x for the Xbox and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).A separate game was released on the Game Boy Color on March 2000 (developed by Natsume and published by Activision) featuring elements from the console versions but focused on skating on a half pipe in a side angle (Half Pipe Mode) and racing opponents in an overhead angle (1on1 Vs. CPU Mode).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, players control their skater as they participate in two-minute runs (one-minute for special \"competition\" runs) where they complete specific goals in that time (such as earning a large score count by performing tricks and collecting symbols scattered around the level).ControlsGetting huge air off a ramp while performing a Grab Trick.Players steer their skater with the D-Pad and jump by pressing the Jump button. Holding down the Jump button while on the ground causes the skater to crouch down, increasing their speed. While in the air, they can hold down a direction on the D-Pad and either press the Flip button to perform a Flip Trick (simple tricks that can be easily chained with other tricks) or hold down the Grab button to perform a Grab Trick (tricks that can be held constantly for more points).Holding down a different direction on the D-Pad performs a different Flip or Grab Trick, which changes the point value of the trick (inversely proportional to the time required to execute the trick). Some advanced Flip Tricks can be held like Grab Tricks. If the player attempts to hit (or land on) a surface while a trick is in effect, the skater bails.Also, while in the air, they can spin around by holding left on the D-Pad, right on the D-Pad, or either shoulder button, increasing the point value (for every 180-degree spins) of the trick in effect (also adding points for simple jumps). However, landing with the skateboard in the wrong position causes the skater to bail.While in the air and close to a grindable edge (such as rails), they can press the Grind button to perform a Grind Trick (which lets them travel along the edge, earning points along the way). If they are close to a wall, they can press the Grind button to Wall Ride off the wall (earning points while increasing the skater's height). In both cases, they can press the Jump button to perform another jump. Pressing Up on the D-Pad and pressing the Grind button approaching straight on a halfpipe lip performs a Handplant.After a trick is successfully executed, they can perform another trick, adding onto the current combo chain (adding to the overall point value of the chain while increasing the chain's score multiplier). The score derived from the chain is added to the overall score counter if the skater lands successfully on the ground. The score is lost completely if the skater bails at any time. Extra points can be added to the chain by collecting special pickups, and hitting Gaps (hidden locational points reached by performing a specific jump, grinding specific edges, and interacting with specific objects).As the player lands more chains, their Special meter increases. Once the meter reaches its maximum capacity, the bar flashes yellow, allowing players to perform special Signature Moves (flashy Grab, Flip, and Grind Tricks that give a lot of points when successfully executed). When the bar is flashing yellow, it slowly depletes (and stops flashing yellow when the meter fully depletes). The meter fully depletes at any time when the skater bails.Holding Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Nollie, and double-tapping Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Fastplant, each adding points during the jump. Players can also perform a Nollie by pressing either shoulder button on the ground (switching their stance) and pressing the Jump button.Game Modes and ObjectivesTony Hawk's Pro Skater includes three single-player game modes (Career, Single Session, and Free Skate) and three multiplayer game modes for up to two players locally (Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE). Levels, skaters, and boards can only be unlocked by playing through Career Mode (or by cheat codes).Career Mode is the single-player campaign, as players lead one of the ten standard skaters (and two unlockable skaters) through all nine levels, unlocking new levels, skaters, and boards by collecting videotapes and winning competitions. Each standard level has five videotapes to collect, each by completing a specific objective in one run:Achieving the level's High Score.Colliding or grinding with five level-specific objects.Finding and collecting five letters (S-K-A-T-E) scattered throughout the level.Finding a videotape pickup somewhere hidden in the level.Achieving the level's Sick Score (which is larger than the High Score).Three levels \"competition\" levels, in which players are ranked (by score) in three one-minute runs. The best two runs are averaged out and compared against the competition, and the player wins by placing in the top three.Along with Career Mode, players can play Single Session, which are simple two-minute runs with the only objective of obtaining the highest score of each level, and Free Skate, which allow players to freely roam each level with no time limit or objectives.Two players can play competitively in three multiplayer modes: Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE. Grafitti and Trick Attack are split-screen simultaneous multiplayer, while HORSE is single-screen alternating multiplayer. In Grafitti, both players race against the clock to \"paint\" the level by performing tricks on objects. The player with the most objects painted wins. In Trick Attack, both players race the clock to achieve the highest score. The player with the highest score wins. In HORSE, players alternate ten-second turns to land a higher scoring chain than the previous one. If a player fails to land a higher score, then he/she gets a letter penalty and the required score resets. If the player gets the maximum letter penalty (making up a word, such as H-O-R-S-E), then the other player wins the game. (If the player fails to land a chain and the previous score is zero, then he/she does not get a penalty) A custom word can be chosen at the beginning of the game.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game includes nine fictional levels (located in the United States) to skate on, each level consisting of either skate parks or other urban environments.WarehouseWarehouse(Woodland Hills, CA)Career High Score: 5,000 points.Career Sick Score: 15,000 points.Career Level Objective: Collide with five sets of boxes.SchoolSchool(Miami, FL)Career High Score: 7,500 points.Career Sick Score: 15,000 points.Career Level Objective: Grind five lunch tables.MallMall(New York City, NY)Career High Score: 10,000 points.Career Sick Score: 30,000 points.Career Level Objective: Break five mall directories.Skate ParkSkate Park(Chicago, IL)Competition Level.DowntownDowntown(Minneapolis, MN)Career High Score: 15,000 points.Career Sick Score: 40,000 points.Career Level Objective: Break five \"No Skating\" signs.Downhill JamDownhill Jam(Phoenix, AZ)Career High Score: 20,000 points.Career Sick Score: 40,000 points.Career Level Objective: Open five water valves.BurnsideBurnside(Portland, OR)Competition Level.StreetsStreets(San Francisco, CA)Career High Score: 25,000 points.Career Sick Score: 50,000 points.Career Level Objective: Wreck five cop cars.RoswellRoswell(Roswell, New Mexico)Competition Level.[CR]Playable Skaters[CR]Tony HawkStyle: Vert (goofy stance)Tony HawkOllie: >>>Speed: >>>>>>>Air: >>>>>>>Balance: >>>>Signature Moves:360 Flip to Mute (1500 points) - Down, Down + Flip.540 Board Varial (2000 points) - Left, Left + Flip.Kickflip McTwist (4000 points) - Right, Right + Grab.The 900 (8000 points) - Right, Down + Grab.Bob BurnquistStyle: VertBob BurnquistOllie: >>>>Speed: >>>>>>Air: >>>>>>Balance: >>>>Signature Moves:One-Footed Smith (grind, minimum 750 points) - Right, Right + Grind.Backflip (4000 points) - Up, Down + Grab.Burntwist (5000 points) - Left, Up + Grind.

Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the \"collecting videotape\" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by LTI Gray Matter), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from \"T\" to \"E\"). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Enhancements[CR]While THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes.Create-a-SkaterCreate-A-Skater editor menu.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create your own skater, allowing you to play through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar of yourself or a custom edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for your character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.An example of a custom gapThe ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign.Park EditorThe Park Editor's toolsetAlso a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.New grind tricks.Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the \"Manuals\" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash CollectablesCash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]HangarLocation: Mullet Falls, MontanaHangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar.

Much like the name implies, the level is built inside a bullring, where a bull runs around leaving piles of poo behind.Chopper DropLocation: HawaiiChopper Drop is one of two secret levels.It features a half-pipe built on a platform out in the ocean. The player drops from an airborne helicopter onto the half-pipe which features a jump at the end of the platform.Skate HeavenLocation: SpaceSkate Heaven is the second secret level. It is set in \"heaven\" which, of course, is in space. It features an inane amount of skateboarding structures like half-pipes, bowls, stairs, rails, gaps, ledges, rails, benches, snake-runs, tunnels and flatland areas. The level is built around a volcano and if the player hops out of the level, an ominous voice (Most likely to symbolize God) either laughs at the player or proclaims \"You suck\" . In the Game Boy Color version, the volcano is absent, but there are different colored nebulas in the distance instead.Secret LevelsWarehouse (PC Only)Location: Woodland HillsWarehouse is primarily an all-around level. It's situated in a dark warehouse and features a hill drop, walls decked with quarter-pipes, a boxed-up taxi cab and a large half-pipe sitting underneath a glass-walled overhang.This level was originally in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.Skate Park (PC Only)Location: ChicagoSkatepark is an all-around level. It's situated in a large indoor skatepark with one half being dedicated to street skateboarding and the other half to vert. It features a large half-pipe, an equally-large U-shaped bowl, a funbox and two long, high-risen rails. This one of 3 competition stages.This level was originally in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.Downhill Jam (PC Only)Location: PhoenixDownhill Jam is primarily a street level. It is the second downhill stage level, similar to Mall though much more downhill-strong than the aforementioned level. It's situated in a open-air water dam and features a host of large jumps, gaps, rails and a massive vert half-pipe formed out of the dam's structure.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]You play as Andy, a young boy who apparently lives alone in a large house with several hundred toys.  Andy has forgotten his childhood toys for his newer fancy toys and other gadgets.  Huggy Bear, his old favorite toy, has formed an alliance with several other old favorites to destroy his new toys and kill Andy (don't deny their intentions, it is what they want).  Andy must round up his few loyal and his new ones to defeat the rebel toy army.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Main Rules Toy Commander plays as a 3rd Person action game. You can fly planes, drive cars, pickup trucks, etc. The game has power-ups, these power ups improve weapon strength in pick-ups that are found typically in these type of games. You get missiles, bombs and mines with limited ammo and unlimited machine gun ammo for whenever you run out of ammo in any other gun. The vehicles in Toy Commander also have gas and health ratings, which over time have to be replenished. The gas, if it runs out, means that your vehicle moves slower, risking yourself when in a fire fight. And the health, when it runs out, ends in the player's vehicle being destroyed. The game also uses the Dreamcast vibration pack and also saves itself automatically if set up to an existing Dreamcast VMU. SingleplayerIn Toy Commander, the singleplayer mode pits the player in a series of missions in each room of the house. The missions range vary, from check point races, which normally have 3 or 4 laps to putting fires out on toy towns and houses. The objective of the single player is to do each of the missions as fast as possible to get the best time and beat the boss in each room. You can also beat each room without having to face the boss at the end, but the experience and difficulty is a lot different if you attempt to break records in order to fight bosses. The way you're shown your missions is quite primitive, with layers of text accompanied by an 3D animated boss, normally to present that they're saying the text.The game doesn't use voices for this area or FMV sequences interestingly enough, and only presents hints to the objective via unusual camera angles and 5 second cut scenes at the beginning of each mission. Each mission you're given a different vehicle to use, normally to help with the task. Sometimes you're given multiple vehicles to make the missions easier to complete or as a necessity to complete the added objectives. It is a good idea that the player uses trial and error for these missions to find the quickest routes, enabling a faster way of completing the mission, depending on what it is. MultiplayerFor up to 4 players in a local splitscreen environment, you can choose which vehicle you want: be it a car, plane, or helicopter to compete in standard deathmatch and capture the flag games. There is also a Cat and Mouse mode, where vehicles must hit each other to get points. Otherwise though, the gameplay is exactly the same. You play in any of the rooms unlocked in story mode and you can pick up a wider array of items and pick-ups than in story mode also. Interestingly, every player has a small base where they can find health and gas upgrades conveniently. Players can also use these bases to change their vehicle when thought necessary, and unlike singleplayer, this doesn't mean simple switching between vehicles, but from a whole list of vehicles in the game. The multiplayer modes also allow players to sabotage each others bases and have turrets and anti-air craft machines that help them defeat the other players. These machine and turrets however can be shot just once and they'll be working on the other side instead. This is the only AI present in the multiplayer modes however.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Trickstyle is set in a future. In the year 2099, tensions between the nations of the world grew to an insane limit This soon led to an Dominance War which led to a serious amount of bloodshed and tears dropped. The governments lost their power, with the few remaining ready to protect earnings and put an end to the violence. This led to a promise of a new world. One that everyone could live peacefully and joyful of what lies ahead. This new world would be put into works as the Reconstructive Age. As the mess of the bleak and wasteful Dominance War ends, a new civilisation, bright and colourful begins.The Reconstructive AgeIn the Reconstructive Age, help was certainly on the horizon. Small companies with little power during the war, such as the Jugaku Corp became rich and famous during the war as they developed the anti-grav technolgy to build up funds. Eventually creating the much demanded Hover-Ride. This made Jugaku the most successful company during that era with them having the most power, money and resources. No one could match their success back then, and at the date Trickstyle is set, they still couldn't now. However Jugaku were a tainted company who caused disasters with their technology, such as the infamous moon base explosion. This horror cause the moon shift on its axis and mass floodings increased everywhere. Bizzarly however, Jugaku were the heroes of this problem as they were ordered to clean up the situation to develop floating platforms for a whole city. They built a Hover-Ride base for Ariel Tokyo winning back the public's heart.The Utopian AgeFollowing the floodings, the One World Confederacy (OWC) was formed. With Jugaku calling the shots and every remaining governement signing up. This new Utopian age promised those who lived in it a perfect society. Crime was unrealistically low, people didn't have to work and everything was made readily available for those living in the new society. The only thing asked in return was loyalty and obedience, which was considered a very small price to pay for such a wonderous living condition. However despite this, people still lived in poverty and terror due to The Fettered States who didn't join up in the OWC. Places like Belfast, Amsterdam, Moscow and Bangkok existed as a place for bandits, mercenaries and lawless states to roam free among the unlucky people who lived there.The Trickstyle Pro-TournamentThe OWC did have problems of its own however. Where the few people worked full time, most people stayed at home, bored out of their minds and looking for a way to enjoy themselves. Then came hoverboarding, a dangerous, but ultimately blazing fast and exciting sport for the kids who had nothing better to do. It was considered cool and a way of stopping problems such as riots, strikes and rebellions. Jugaku noticed this and turned hoverboarding into a competiton, a competition known as the Trickstyle Pro-Tournament. The tournament provided athletes everything they needed to compete: prizes, facilites and equipment.The first winner of the competition was a man named Shin, who continued to win it five years in a row. He also became the first and last Jugaku sponsered athelete. The races were everywhere, but the real home of hoverboarding was ariel Tokyo, where the last race is always held every year. Thousands of people across the globe make the journey to see the last race, just simply due to the significance it has on the tournament. In fact, the reward of this Trickstyle is the prize of being the mayor of any OWC city of the winner's choice, just to add excitement and hype over the eventual end of the events in the game.[CR]",

                "plot": "In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger Hearts. Despite their awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop unique personalities. Of three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two years ago.[CR]The story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear (who took on the personality of Exelica's big sister) are summoned to quell a mysterious rebellion of military machines against their human creators.[CR]Trigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and is composed of 5 stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart's most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros.[CR]In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players.[CR]The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player selectable fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper C'r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the game.",

Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license. [CR]UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.[CR]The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.[CR]In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:[CR]Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams.  In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice.  The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams.  The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.[CR]National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests.  Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way.  This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result).  The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals.  Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded.  The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward.  The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.[CR]National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers.  The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once.  The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals.  Penalty shootouts settle ties.[CR]Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.[CR]8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition.  The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.[CR]Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Unreal Tournament is an arena-based first-person shooter developed by Epic Games and Digital Extremes and published by GT Interactive for the PC in November 30, 1999. Originally planned to be a multiplayer add-on to the original Unreal, Unreal Tournament became a fast-paced multiplayer-oriented spinoff that spawned its own series of games.Primarily a multiplayer game for up to sixteen players, Unreal Tournament includes a variety of game modes, including standard Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch (with up to four teams), Last Man Standing (Deathmatch with limited respawns), Capture the Flag, Domination (where up to four teams must maintain control of three control points), and Assault (a two-team mission-based mode). The game also includes a single-player campaign where you must progress through over 40 matches to reach the final battle with the tournament champion, Xen (who is unlockable when you win the tournament).[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Unreal Tournament offers a variety of different game modes consisting of classics such as Deathmatch and Capture the Flag, but also brought an entire new game mode onto the table with Assault.DeathmatchClassic free-for-all gameplay. Reach a target number of frags to win.Team DeathmatchSimilar to deathmatch but with teams. The first team to reach target number of frags wins.Last Man StandingSimilar to deathmatch but with a limited number of lives. Last player alive wins.Capture the FlagTeams compete to capture the opponent's flag and return it to their base. First team to reach target number of flag captures wins. If the score is tied when time runs out, the match enters into a sudden death mode where the first team to capture wins the match.DominationSimilar to the well known \"King of the Hill\" mode in other games, Domination maps contain three control points that must be captured and held by teams in order to gain points. First team to reach target number of points wins. Each control point is scored and controlled separately, so teams need not control all three to begin scoring.AssaultThe closest thing UT99 has to missions, assault mode tasks each team with a set number of objectives. One team is attacking while the other is defending and trying to prevent the attacking team from completing their objectives. If the objectives are completed within a time limit, the attacking team wins, but if the time runs out without the objectives being completed the defending team takes the win. After every round, attacking and defending teams switch sides. If the attacking team wins within the time limit, when the sides switch, the new attacking team must complete all the objectives faster than the previous team in order to win.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]One of the most interesting parts of Unreal Tournament is its weapons. Each weapon has a primary and secondary fire that can work together to create devastating combos.PictureDescriptionTranslocatorClassification: Personal Teleportation DevicePrimary Fire: Launches the destination module. Throw the module to the location you would like to teleport to.Secondary Fire: Activates the Translocator and teleports the user to the destination module.Techniques: Throw your destination module at another player and activate the secondary fire and you will teleport to your opponent's exact position, killing them instantly.Description: The Translocator was originally designed by Liandri Corporation's R&D sector to facilitate the rapid recall of miners and equipment during tunnel collapses and other emergencies.Impact HammerClassification: Melee PistonPrimary Fire: Charges up to smash opponents for massive damage.Secondary Fire: Damages opponents at close range and has the ability to deflect bullets.Techniques: Fire at the ground while jumping to increase jump height.Description: The Impact Hammer was originally designed for sub-surface drift mining but numerous mining accidents demonstrated the Hammer's devastating effects on the human body and it was adopted into combat use.ChainsawClassification: Melee BladePrimary Fire: Hold down trigger to rev up the chain covered blade. Drive this blade into opponents to inflict massive damage.Secondary Fire: The revved up blade can be swung horizontally and can cause instant decapitation of foes.Techniques: The chainsaw makes a loud and recognizable roar and can be avoided by listening for audio cues.Description: A chainsaw.EnforcerClassification: Light PistolPrimary Fire: Accurate but slow firing instant hit.Secondary Fire: Sideways firing mode, shoots twice as fast and half as accurate as primary fire.Techniques: Collect two enforcers to dual-wield for twice the damage.Description: The Enforcer pistol was designed by Axon Research Corporation and has become known for it's dependability in battle.Bio RifleClassification: Toxic RiflePrimary Fire: Wads of Tarydium byproduct are lobbed at a medium rate.Secondary Fire: When trigger is held down the Bio Rifle will create a much larger wad of byproduct that will burst into smaller wads which will adhere to any surfaces.Techniques: Byproducts will adhere to walls, floors, or ceilings. Chain reactions can be caused by covering entryways with this lethal green waste.Description: The GES Bio Rifle is one of the most controversial weapons in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the Bio Rifle has long been the subject of debate over its usefulness.Shock RifleClassification: Energy RiflePrimary Fire: Instant hit laser beam.Secondary Fire: Large, slow moving plasma core.Techniques: Shooting the secondary fire's core with a primary beam will cause a small spherical explosion, killing most nearby opponents instantly.Description: The ASMD Shock Rifle sports two firing modes, and while these modes are each deadly in their own right, used together they can neutralize opponents in a devastating shockwave.Pulse GunClassification: Plasma RiflePrimary Fire: Fires fast-moving green orbs of plasma.Secondary Fire: A bolt of green plasma lightning is expelled with limited length.Techniques: Moving back and forth while using secondary fire increases the damage due to what is known as the \"Saw Effect\".Description: The Plasma Rifle has the highest firing rate of any in the game. Due to this, the Plasma Rifle is great for when retreating around corners.RipperClassification: Ballistic Blade LauncherPrimary Fire: Razor sharp titanium discs are launched at a medium rate of speed. Shots will ricochet off any surfaces for six rimes before disappearingSecondary Fire: Explosive discs are launched at a slower rate of fire.Techniques: Aim for the necks of your opponents and shoot around corners if you suspect there's an enemy.Description: The Ripper launches spinning saw blades that have huge headshot potential. Users are rewarded for accurate shots.MinigunClassification: Gatling GunPrimary Fire: Bullets are sprayed forth at a fast rate of fire and good accuracy.Secondary Fire: Minigun fires twice as fast and half as accurate.Techniques: Secondary Fire is much more useful at close range but can waste a lot of ammo.Description: The Minigun is a 23mm rotary cannon capable of firing both high-velocity caseless ammunition and cased rounds.Flak CannonClassification: Heavy ShrapnelPrimary Fire: White hot chunks of scrap metal spray out in a wide spread.Secondary Fire: A flak grenade is launched out of the gun with a high arc, exploding on impact.Techniques: The Flak Cannon is most useful in close quarters combat.Description: The Flak Cannon, created by Trident Defensive Technologies, is one of the most popular weapons in the tournament. It is banned from most military conflicts for high incidences of maiming and collateral damage.Rocket LauncherClassification: Heavy BallisticPrimary Fire: Slow moving but deadly rockets are fired at opponents. Trigger can be held down to load up to six rockets into the barrel which can then be fired in either a flat, horizontal pattern or a tight spiral.Secondary Fire: Up to six grenades can be lobbed from the barrel.Techniques: Keeping this weapon aimed at an opponent will cause it to lock on.Description: The Rocket Launcher is extremely popular among competitors who enjoy more bang for their buck.Sniper RifleClassification: Long Range BallisticPrimary Fire: Fires a high powered bullet.Secondary Fire: Zooms the rifle in, up to eight times normal vision.Techniques: Great for long distance headshots.Description: The Sniper Rifle's high-caliber round is lethal at any range.

Despite coming out earlier, it was actually derived from the Playstation 2 version of the game with more features dropped due to system limitations. The game allowed for online multiplayer for up to eight players by utilizing the Dreamcast Modem or Dreamcast Broadband Adapter sold separately. The game also offered up to four player split-screen multiplayer offline with four controllers. Depending on the amount active players for split-screen modes, certain levels will not be available for selection due to their size and system limitations. Only one player per console can play online. The game also makes use of proprietary Dreamcast Keyboard and Dreamcast Mouse accessories as well as the MadCatz' Panther DC.The game saw several modifications such as levels altered or sized down due to the system hardware. HUD elements are now represented by health bars and icons rather than numbered percentages. The female, robot and Nali War Cow avatars are removed. The game has also been censored due to standards placed by Sega. For example, the murals of naked women in the training level are redrawn. An exclusive level is available for paying members of SegaNet.Playstation 2The Sony Playstation 2 version was developed in-house by Epic Games.The hardware allowed to lift some of the limitations seen on the Dreamcast version such as more complicated geometry, effects, crisper sound and retained the female and robot avatars as well as the Assault gametype. Four player split-screen multiplayer can be played with the use of the multi-tap peripheral or by plugging in USB-compatible keyboard or mouse perhiperals and map them to each player. More than one keyboard or mouse can be plugged into the system with the use of USB hubs. However the port does not retain online multiplayer.Players can map multiple keyboard and mice for better precision.Instead this version is compatible with the Playstation 2's iLink Cable. Up to two systems can link together. The instruction manual states up to four systems can link up, however the main menu only allows for two players. To allow for up to four systems to link together, link the systems via an iLink hub, then one player will need to host a server, then during gameplay pause the game and enter the following code:LEFT, CIRCLE, LEFT, RIGHT, SQUARE, RIGHT.The game will then unpause and display the \"Waiting for Other Players,\" message. Then the other three players can join the game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack was released November 22nd 1999, there are no particular order for the tracklist.1.\"Opening\"Alexander Brandon & Michiel Van Den Bos1:232.\"Menu\"Alexander Brandon2:003.\"The Course\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:284.\"Nether Animal\"Michiel Van Den Bos5:005.\"Into the Darkness\"Alexander Brandon2:436.\"Mechanism Eight\"Andrew Sega6:147.\"Run\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:298.\"Mission Landing\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:139.\"FireBR (Fire Breath)\"Tero Kostermaa & Kai-Eerik Kompaa3:1510.\"Lock\"Alexander Brandon2:4411.\"Foregone Destruction\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:1412.\"BotMCA #10\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:1213.\"Razorback\"Peter Hajba4:4314.\"Cannonade\"Michiel Van Den Bos1:5515.\"Enigma\"Dan Gardop\u00e9e3:2416.\"Save Me\"Alexander Brandon1:5117.\"Underworld 2\"Alexander Brandon3:0918.\"Seeker\"Dan Gardop\u00e9e3:2619.\"Skyward Fire\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:5620.\"Colossus\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:1721.\"BotPack #9\"Michiel Van Den Bos4:4922.\"Go Down\"Alexander Brandon2:5923.\"Three Wheels Turning\"Alexander Brandon2:2524.\"SuperFist\"Alexander Brandon1:5725.\"Phantom\"Alexander Brandon & Michiel Van Den Bos5:5026.\"Organic\"Alexander Brandon3:0327.\"Room of Champions\"Alexander Brandon2:1528.\"Ending\"Alexander Brandon1:09[CR]Original/Official System Requirements[CR]LinuxOperating System: Linux 2.2.x with glibc 2.1CPU: Intel Pentium IIMemory 64 MB ; Recommended: 128 MBHard Drive Space 550 MB of free spaceNetwork Internet connection required for online multiplayerWindows MinimumOperating System: Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT 4.0 (will also run on XP/Vista/7/8 and even server versions without a problem).CPU: Intel Pentium 200 MHzMemory: 32 MBHard Drive Space: 120 MB of free spaceNetwork Internet connection required for online multiplayerWindows RecommendedCPU: Pentium II 266 MHzMemory: 64 MBHard Drive Space: 605 MB of free spaceNetwork Internet connection required for online multiplayerMacintoshOperating System: Mac OS 7.6 or higherCPU: PowerPC 603e 200 MHz or fasterMemory: 64 MBHard Drive Space: 120 MB of free space[CR]",

It was the first game developed by Mucky Foot Productions, and was published by Eidos. the game features both hand-to-hand combat and firearms, as well as large maps that can be freely roamed across.Another game, Urban Chaos: Riot Response, was released by Eidos in 2006, but other than a shared title, the two games are unrelated.It has been re-released digitally on PlayStation Network for PS3, PSP and PS Vita, and PC through Steam and GoG.com.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The plot itself is split into two parts. The player initially takes on the role of police officer D'arci Stern, a new recruit in the Union City Police Department. Throughout the course of the game, Stern butts heads with a criminal gang known as the Wildcats, who are growing in power with disturbing speed. Through her contact with a man who identifies himself only as \"Roper\", Stern realizes that their eventual goal is to take over Union City. As D'arci makes her way deeper into the criminal underworld and uncovers more information about the Wildcats, she discovers that the gang has connections to mayoral candidate Bane, as part of their overall plans to wage war against the UCPD. As a Wildcat riot breaks out, the UCPD largely manages to bring the city back under control, mostly through D'arci's direct intervention.The second part of the plot deals with a criminal investigation into a brutal murder. D'arci discovers that the murder was carried out by Bane's mysterious bodyguards, the men in black. She also learns that he will stop at nothing to achieve power far beyond that of a city mayor. It turns out that Bane is involved with an ancient evil and preparing to invoke a dark ritual. While the rest of the UCPD is busy quelling the rioting Wildcats, D'arci and Roper must hunt Bane down and stop him before he completes his ritual and brings Hell to Earth.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]Windows 95/98/Me/XP/7;Pentium 233 or above;4x CD-ROM drive;32MB RAM (Rec.), 64MB (Rec.);4MB DirectX 6.1 compatible graphics card;DirectX 6.1 compatible sound card;150MB free hard drive space.[CR]",

What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.[CR]The standard racing game modes are here:  Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race.  One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition.  You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events.  Some example events are the long jump and the slalom.[CR]The selection of cars is quite diverse.

Sadly, one of the heroic Vigilantes, Slick Clyde, rises as the leader of the OMAR oil conglomerate in the far future. Sidburn's rogue gunnrunners may have failed to capture the United States for their Oil conglomerate, but Slick Clyde decides to use the power of time travel to go back to the 1970s and try again to recapture the United States. Clyde travels back with the cybernetic hitman Dallas 13 and the silent assassin Obake to kill Convoy and take over America.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As in the previous game 2nd Offense is a car combat game. Each vehicle has a machine gun with unlimited ammo, and can also pick up more powerful limited use weapons like missiles and mines from pickups throughout the level. Each weapon pickup has a normal firing mode, and two special firing modes that are activated by taping in specific directions before firing. For example, a missile can be ignited but not launched, turning it into a rocket-powered nitro. Each character also has a special weapon unique to their vehicle.A new addition to this sequel are vehicle traction replacements. By driving over a ski, aqua jet, or hover icon in a level a vehicle's tires will be replaced. Skis offer better traction over snow, aqua jets can drive over water without sinking, and the hover attachment enables a car to fly.Each stage in the game has a specific objective for each faction: a target must either be protected for the Vigilantes, destroyed for the Coyotes, or a non-destruction related objective must be met for the Drifters. Sometimes items must also be collected and delivered. As well all opponent vehicles must be destroyed. Almost every object in a level can either be destroyed or damaged by weapon's fire. Some will drop special weapons when broken, while others will change the level, such as the giant model doughnut on a cafe which will fall off and roll around the level after the cafe is destroyed, or bridges that collapse after being weakened.Destroyed vehicles drop upgrade points that increase a character's car's parameters; at 50 points in a stat the vehicle is upgraded with an accessory and at 100 in all four stats the vehicle is upgraded to a completely new design.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Coyotes:Dallas 13Nina LocoMoloLord Clyde (unlockable)Obake (unlockable)Boogie (unlockable)Vigilantes:SheilaJohn TorqueFlying All Star TrioHouston (unlockable)Convoy (unlockable)Dave's Cultsman (unlockable)Drifters:Garbage ManAstronaut Bob OR.

Meteors will occasionally fall from the sky, especially if the observatory is destroyed. An extra large meteor will sometimes fall into a crater, and if destroyed will unleash a giant ant.Winter Games, UtahA mountain ski resort, complete with slalom, long jump, and half pipe. Cars can also ride the ski lifts.Ghastly Bayou, LouisianaA remote swamp location complete with abandoned plantation house, graveyard, and levy. Ghosts will attack nearby cars if their tombstones or crypts are destroyed, and the entire level will flood if the levy is opened.Launch Site, FloridaAn island launch pad for the space shuttle. Players can manually launch the space shuttle, or even launch themselves by driving around the tower's rear. On their return to earth they can pick up floating health and weapons in the sky. Highly explosive fuel containers are located throughout the island, and hungry sharks swim around the island's edges.Steel Mill, PennsylvaniaThe steel mill has a train that circles around the level endlessly. The train can be destroyed, or will crash itself if it run into a destroyed bridge. If parts of the mill are broken they will leak liquid metal on to cars passing nearby.Nuclear Plant, MinnesotaThis plant consists of two reactors and a field of generators, turbines, and transformers. If a reactor is shot is will go critical and detonate, dealing massive damage to any nearby vehicles. The turbines and transformers are also dangerous, capable of shocking any nearby cars if they're charged up.Alaskan Pipeline, AlaskaAn oil drilling and refining plant. The pipeline acts as quick transportation for cars, sucking them in and depositing them elsewhere in the level. Pools of crude oil will also slow down any vehicle that drives into them, and can be ignited with special weapons.Pacific Harbor, CaliforniaA major shipping location with cranes and sea access. A massive bridge runs the length of the level, and, of course, can be destroyed.Old Levels:All the levels from the first Vigilante 8 game can be played on the PS1 and DC versions of the game. On the PS1 the V8 disc must be hotswapped into the system while the game is paused. The disc will be read, the game will notify the player that the old levels have been unlocked, and the V8:2O disc will then need to be replaced. On the DC the code OLD_LEVELS only has to be entered.Secret Base, NevadaSand Factory, UtahOil Fields, New MexicoAircraft Graveyard, ArizonaGhost Town, New MexicoHoover Dam, Arizona/NevadaValley Farms, CaliforniaCasino City, NevadaCanyon Lands, UtahSki Resort, Colorado[CR]",

The game can be controlled by the use of various peripherals like the light gun or PC mouse. The player does not manually control camera movement, but has to skilfully shoot the scripted enemies and avoid killing civilians. The player gets rewarded with extra points for disarming opponents by performing 'justice shots' or drowning them with a hail of bullets by performing '3 point shots'. Virtua Cop's sequel provides gamers with two modes - 'arcade' and proving ground. The first one allows players to choose from one of three available stages of various difficulty level in any order. The second one serves as a shooting ground with 3 fields to choose from. After each segment of the game the players can see their statistics which involve: score, the number of killed gangsters and civilians, total number of shots, the number of successful shots and overall accuracy. Apart from killing villains the game features numerous destructible surrounding elements (you can even play drums!), which lower the overall accuracy, but are cool enough, that it is often hard to resist not to shoot 'just one more window'. There are also in-game upgrades that are hidden in these destructible elements. By shooting them the players can gain access to extra lives, magnums, rifles, automatics, shotguns, machine guns and more.[CR]Selectable stages[CR]Stage select.The game features only three selectable stages, but each of them has alternate routes to follow. Each major stage ends with a boss battle.File 1: Big Chase!

(Medium)- On Deck- BridgeBoss: Aero-Divers - five soldiers with jetpacks. They shoot rockets.File 3: Railline Shooutout! (Expert)- Arcade Line- Saturn WayBoss: Garse Bradley - basically it is a general operating a heavily armored tank.After successfully shooting through all three episodes awaits the final battle with 'the Mastermind' - a supervillain wearing a jetpack.[CR]",

                "plot": "Virtua Fighter 3 is the third game in the Virtua Fighter series of 3D fighting games by Sega-AM2 and Yu Suzuki. Originally released as the first title for the Sega Model 3 arcade board in 1996, the game was highly praised for its advanced graphics engine, featuring an unprecedented amount of environmental and character details. Some of the graphical advances introduced by its groundbreaking 3D graphics engine include specular shading, T&L lighting, cloth physics, particle effects, inverse kinematics, facial animation, eye movement, and multi-sample anti-aliasing.When the game was unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in early March 1996, Computer and Video Games described it as \"the most astounding display of video game graphic muscle ever in the history of this industry.\" The E3 demonstration in May 1996 left an equally strong impression on spectators.An updated version of the game, Virtua Fighter 3tb (\"team battle\") was released in arcades in 1997; this version was later ported to the Dreamcast console by Genki in 1998.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] changes[CR]Virtua Fighter 3 played very similar to prior titles in the series, with the exception of the addition of a fourth button, Dodge. By combining the button with various movements on the joystick, a player could attempt to evade attacks made by their opponent.Another major gameplay change is that now, for the first time in the series, the stages featured stairs, slopes, and even walls, contrasting sharply with the previous flat, wall-less environments in previous Virtua Fighter games.Two new characters, fan dancer Aoi Umenokouji and sumo wrestler Taka-Arashi, are introduced in Virtua Fighter 3. While Aoi would return in later games in the series, VF3 is Taka-Arashi's only appearance.In the updated \"team battle\" version of the game, players could make teams consisting of different fighters and use fight against other players' teams, not entirely unlike King of Fighters.There was also an option to fight in the first-person perspective in Virtua Fighter 3tb. It was interesting to try, but not at all practical considering the quick nature of fights.[CR]Sega Model 3 arcade hardware[CR]Virtua Fighter 3 served as the debut title for the Sega Model 3 arcade system board, which at the time of its release in 1996 was the most powerful gaming system released up until that time, and it would remain the most powerful gaming system up until the release of the Dreamcast console and its Sega Naomi arcade counterpart in 1998.The technical specifications for the Sega Model 3 (Step 1.0) arcade hardware used for the game. It consists of three boards: the main CPU (Central Processing Unit) board, the graphics/video board, and the ROM (Read-Only Memory) board. It was also possible to add an optional MPEG sound board to improve the audio.ProcessorsMain CPU (Central Processing Unit) processor: Motorola PowerPC 603e (32/64-bit) @ 166 MHz Instruction performance: 235 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Floating point performance: 332 MFLOPS (Million Floating-point Operations Per Sec)GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processors: 2x Lockheed Martin Real3D/Pro-1000 (64-bit) Floating point performance: 1000 MFLOPS?Sound CPU: Motorola 68EC000 (16-bit) @ 11.3 MHz (2 MIPS)Sound chips: 2\u00d7 Yamaha SCSP / YMF292-F / FH-1 128-step DSP (Digital Signal Processor) Interfaces: MIDI, FM synthesis, PCM, DACFeatures: 4-channel surround sound, 64 voices, 64 PCM channels, 16-bit PCM audioSampling rate: 44.1 KHzMemoryMain RAM (Random Access Memory) memory: 8 MB RAM @ 66 MHzBackup RAM: 64 KBAudio RAM: 1 MB (512 KB on each SCSP sound chip)Audio ROM (Read-Only Memory) memory: 16.5 MB (on SCSP sound chips)Graphics ROM: 64 MBGraphicsResolution: 640 x 480 pixels, non-interlaced (progressive scan), Z-bufferingColours on screen: 16.78 million (24-bit colour)Geometric performance: Geometrizer: 2,000,200 triangle polygons/sec, 1,000,100 rectangle polygons/secRenderer: 60 million pixels per secondTextures: 16 million coloured textures per secondGraphical capabilities: Texture mapping, trilinear filtering, mipmapping, specular reflection, Gouraud shading, flat shading, anti aliasing, alpha blending, perspective texture mapping, trilinear interpolation, micro texture shading, high-specular Gouraud shadingVideo: Full color texture mapping, tri-linear interpolation, micro texture, shading high-specula gouraud shading , fix shading, flat shading, texture & edge multi layered anti-aliasing (multi-sample anti-aliasing), lighting effects, parallel light, 4 spot light, pin spot light, special effect zoning-fog, 32 levels of translucencySpecial effects: Zoning fog, 32 levels of translucency, clipping, model & texture LOD, fade in/out, 4095 moving modelsLighting: Parallel light, 4 light sports, pin-point light, specular shading, T&L lightingOther features: Cloth physics, particle effects, inverse kinematics, facial animation, eye movementOptional MPEG sound boardDSB1 hardware: Sound CPU: Zilog Z80Sound chip: NEC uD65654GF102DSB2 hardware: Sound CPU: Motorola 68000Sound chip: NEC uD65654GF102Features: MPEG streaming audio support, play back music in stereo, stream mono music from left and right channels separately[CR]Home console ports[CR]A home port of Virtua Fighter 3 was originally announced for the Sega Saturn but was never released. According to popular legend, two different versions of the game were developed by Sega AM2, but both were rejected for release by Sega, who had decided to abandon the 32-bit Saturn in favor of the Dreamcast. While it is not known if there are any prototypes of Saturn VF3 floating around, countless websites devoted to tracking down unreleased videogames contain phonebooks worth of information on the ill-fated title, and many hope that the game will someday be leaked to the public. It is speculated that the game would've looked and performed very similar to the Saturn version of AM2's Shenmue, which was also canceled and later released on the Dreamcast.While AM2 was busy working on Shenmue and the Saturn version of VF3, Sega contracted Japanese developer Genki, most widely known for their Tokyo Xtreme Racing series, to create a version of VF3tb for the Dreamcast. Genki reprogrammed the game from the ground up for Sega's Naomi arcade board (roughly the arcade equivalent of a Dreamcast) using as many of the Model 3 version's resources as possible, then ported this version to the Dreamcast. As a result of this porting method many elements of the home port were changed drastically from its arcade counterpart. Most noticably, the graphics took a huge hit on the Dreamcast, with character models having a lower polygon count, certain arenas having very noticable enivornmental glitches, and, in the original Japanese release, glitchy character shadowing.The Dreamcast version of Virtua Fighter 3tb was meant to be a launch title for the Dreamcast in the US, but extra development time was spent fixing many of the Japanese version's bugs. The port was hugely successful in its native Japan but less so in the US, where the arugably more-polished launch title Soulcalibur outsold VF3.[CR]",

Taking a more complex route than the WCW world tour series. The control scheme mimicked more of a fighting game, rather than a traditional wrestling game. The game required a button sequence to pull off moves. For example: Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver required the following button sequence:Down, Up, Down, or Up, Down, Up (depending on location) + C Left on the Nintendo 64.[CR]Career Mode[CR]Using any wrestler from the roster you compete in 3 title runs, starting from the European title, Intercontinental title, and the WWF title, going through the list of wrestlers in various matches and different situations. After winning the title, you defend the title against the top 5 wrestlers. Also in the career mode, you can do a tag team career mode with a computer character. By completing the career mode, you can unlock more wrestlers and cheats, which can be accessed in the cheat menu option.[CR]Create a Wrestler[CR]The create a wrestler or C.A.W had a robust set of features. The player could choose from a wide range of options including : Gender, Attributes, Moveset, Entrances, and Taunts.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling video game that was made specifically for arcades and released in summer 2000. The game's title is based around the  WWF's yearly pay-per-view event of the same name. This was  THQ's 3rd effort under the World Wrestling Federation banner since signing a 10-year contract to make WWF (which became World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002) games. Despite being created for arcades, a console port for the  Sega Dreamcast was created and released to stores in North America on August 15, 2000, a few weeks after the machines were sent out to arcades. A European version was released for the Dreamcast on September 22, 2000. A Japanese version was released for the Dreamcast on April 26, 2001. Yuke's developed both versions, though publishing rights were split.  Sega published the arcade version while THQ published the Dreamcast version. The arcade version ran on the Sega NAOMI hardware. The arcade cabinet had a dual monitor design to allow up to four players to play simultaneously; two on one screen, two on another. The Dreamcast version also allowed for four simultaneous players.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]WWF Royal Rumble was a ground-breaking wrestling game in terms of technical capability. Previously, wrestling games in the  PlayStation/ Nintendo 64 era had been limited to only being able to allow four wrestlers on screen at once. Royal Rumble more than doubled this amount. Running on the Sega NAOMI hardware, it allows up to nine wrestlers to be on screen at the same time. While not so eye-opening for an arcade game, the Dreamcast (which contained hardware very similar to Sega NAOMI) very impressively was able to replicate the arcade's ability to allow nine wrestlers on screen at once. Royal Rumble was the first console wrestling game in the 3D era to break the barrier of having more than four wrestlers on screen at the same time. Beyond that though, there wasn't much else to the game. At a time when console wrestling games and technology were heavily evolving to allow some of the more iconic gimmick matches of the 90s to be simulated in a video game, such as the cage match and the ladder match, many were excited to see what the Dreamcast would be capable of. However, THQ decided to make the Dreamcast version a straight port of the arcade version. Thus, it was critically panned due to its lack of game modes and small roster of WWF wrestlers compared to other games that had already been on the market for months, such as  WWF WrestleMania 2000 for the Nintendo 64 and  WWF SmackDown! for the Sony PlayStation. Game ModesThe only two modes in the game are Exhibition and Royal Rumble. In Exhibition mode, the player chooses a wrestler to play as in a series of singles matches only. He or she is also given the option to select a partner of sorts, despite only being able to wrestle singles matches. The partner is used for selective interference at the command of the player. In singles matches, if the match is nearing the time limit, the ring will fade from the background and the wrestlers will be transferred to a backstage area, such as a kitchen, a boiler room, or a parking lot.In Royal Rumble mode, the mode is patterned around the yearly event but is not directly replicated. Instead of merely surviving, you must be active in eliminating people. You begin the match as your selected character. You have a three-minute timer on the screen. The object is to not get eliminated or let the timer run out. An elimination requires being thrown over the top rope and hitting the floor with both feet. Eliminating wrestlers adds 20 seconds to the clock. Eliminating a wrestler with a \"S\" near their feet will add 40 seconds to the clock. In the arcade version, if you get eliminated or the timer runs out, you must insert a credit to continue. In the Dreamcast version, you merely press start to continue. This mode is where the small roster becomes noticeable, as you'll see a handful of wrestlers reappear later in the match. The match requires 30 wrestlers and there are only 19 or 21 wrestlers, depending on the version you are playing. Up to nine wrestlers can be in the ring at one time in this mode. MetersThe game has both an energy meter and  super meter for each character. When the energy meter is completely depleted, the match automatically ends in a knockout. When the super meter is filled, a \"S\" is gained. You need three S's to perform your character's  finishing maneuver. You can also use a S to escape elimination from the Royal Rumble or kick out of a pinfall where you normally wouldn't be able to. [CR]Playable Roster[CR]The arcade version has 19 playable characters, while the Dreamcast version has 21.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Board and Game PiecesA game of Wetrix is played on a flat, square 3D platform that occupies the majority of the screen. The player can use various game pieces to raise and lower the landscape to contain and control water on the board. The game pieces are as follows:UppersRed, upwards facing arrows that raise the landscape by one level. They come in four standard shapes: a straight line, a T shape, an L shape and a square ring. These are one of, if not the most common piece in the game; and in most game modes, several of these will fall initially to let the player build a perimeter before any water or other pieces fall.DownersGreen, downwards facing arrows that lower the landscape. They come in two standard shapes: a small square and a straight line. No matter how high the downer connects with land, it will lower the land to the lowest point that any part of the downer touches. As such, if a downer is placed on a completely flat surface, it will have no effect.Water BubblesBubbles of water that break open upon contact with any piece of land. They come in various sizes. When water spills out of the bubbles, it behaves like water, flowing across the ground and attempting to fill the shape of its container. If water leaks over the edge of the board, blue arrows will flash to indicate where the spillage is occurring.FireballsBalls of fire that evaporate water, thaw ice and destroy land. They exist in only one form. When fireballs hit a body of water, they will continue moving to the ground, evaporating the water as they go. Depending on the land surrounding and underneath the water, some water may still remain. If a fireball hits dry land, it will explode, clearing the point of contact to the ground and creating a sloped crater around it. Fireballs will also thaw ice, though a second fireball will be needed to evaporate the water.BombsBombs, though not of the giant variety, that blow holes in the landscape. They exist in only one form. When a bomb hits land, no matter how high, it destroys the point of contact, leaving a hole in the land where it landed and slightly deformed terrain in the immediate surroundings. The hole can be expanded by downers and repaired by uppers. If a bomb is placed in an existing bomb hole, a re-bomb is triggered: three additional bombs are dropped on the field at random. If one of these bombs land in an existing bomb hole, another re-bomb is triggered.Lakes and The DrainAny body of water on the game board is counted as a lake. Even if the water has no walls around it and is flowing towards the perimeter, it is counted as a lake.On the right side of the screen is the Drain Meter, which represents how much water has flown off of the board. When the drain is nearly full, it will begin blinking to notify the player. When the drain fills completely, the game is over. The player can evaporate lakes to reduce the drain meterThe Earthquake MeterOn the left side of the screen is the Earthquake Meter, which represents how much land has been added to the starting game board. As the land is raised, through action of the player or certain game modes, the Earthquake Meter fills; similarly, when the land is lowered, the meter empties.When the meter is nearly full, it will begin shaking violently, blinking and beeping to notify the player. If the Earthquake Meter fills completely, the board shakes, warping the landscape, and the meter resets. The game does not end if the Earthquake Meter fills, however an earthquake can often lead to a full drain; and if not, the player will be left in a position extremely difficult to recover from. In this way, the Earthquake Meter can be seen as a bigger danger than the Drain Meter.Levels, Smart Bombs, Ice Cubes and MinesAs games progress, a timer in the upper-right corner of the screen will run. After a few minutes, a chime will play a couple of times and the game's level will increase. With each level increased the background and land change their colours and the speed at which pieces drop increases. The highest level in any game is level 10.Smart BombsIf the player has at least five lakes on the game board when a level up occurs in certain game modes, they will be rewarded with a smart bomb. When activated, a smart bomb resets the game board to a flat, empty state, empties the Drain Meter and Earthquake meter, and queues several uppers in the piece queue, similar to the beginning of the game. The score, level timer and current level are not reset, though, allowing the player to come back from a potential game over.Ice CubesFrom level 2 onwards (excluding levels 4 and 8), ice cubes will periodically fall onto the largest body of water on the board. If the cube hits a body of water, it will freeze over. After a length of time, the ice will thaw and the water will flow freely again. If the ice hits dry land, however, the player will receive bonus points. The player can also use fireballs to thaw the ice instantly.MinesOn levels 4, 8, 9 and 10, multiple mines will periodically fall into a single body of water. The mines float in the water for a short amount of time and are predominately harmless. They can be split up into separate lakes and forced onto dry ground without risk. However if the player evaporates a lake with mines in it, the mines will explode, stopping the evaporation and leaving holes akin to those made by bombs where the mines were.Scoring, Duckies and RainbowsMore often than not, the objective in a game of Wetrix is to score as many points as possible. Points can be gained from dropping game pieces onto the board before they land on their own, letting ice land on dry land, repairing holes in the landscape and thawing ice. The main method of gaining points, however, is evaporating lakes.All scores in a game of Wetrix are calculated based on how well the player is doing in the current game. Base scores are initially multiplied by the number of lakes and the current level. From there, two different types of multiplier can increase scores dramatically.RainbowsIf enough water is contained on the game board, a rainbow will form across the board. When the rainbow is active, all scores are multiplied by 10. Only one rainbow can be present on the game board at any one time.Rubber DuckiesIf any lake on the board has a water level reaching two layers of land deep, a rubber ducky will begin swimming in it. Only the depth of the lake is important; the lake can be as large or as small as is necessary. When a rubber ducky is on the board, all scores will be multiplied by two, stacking with each additional ducky that appears. For example, if a fireball evaporates a lake for what amounts to 10,000 points, a rainbow is active and there are four rubber duckies active, the score will be:10,000 - x10100,000 - x2200,000 - x2400,000 - x2800,000 - x21,600,000Rankings and Tile SetsAt the end of a game, the player is given a rank (beginner, ok, good, excellent, expert, super, master) based on either the score earned in that game, the playtime in that game or the level reached. If the player can earn a minimum rank across all modes that award ranks, the player is given alternate sets of game pieces.Tile Set 1The default tile set, available from the beginning of the game.Tile Set 2Awarded for a rank of \"ok\" across all game modes, this tile set replaces most uppers and downers. While the straight, I-shaped piece remains of both types, new pieces include triangular pieces, straight pieces of half the length as the I-shaped piece and a square upper, similar to the square ring piece, however with only a small hole in the centre.Additionally, the piece queue icon in the lower-right of the screen can be inaccurate, with pieces shown as downers in the piece queue appearing in the game as bombs.Tile Set 3Awarded for a rank of \"expert\" across all game modes.Tile Set 4Awarded for a rank of \"super\" across all game modes.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]There are several game modes in Wetrix.Classic ModeA no-frills game of Wetrix. The player starts at level 1 and plays to earn as many points as possible until the drain fills up. Smart bombs can be earned at level-ups. Ice cubes and mines appear normally.Pro ModeA much more challenging game of Wetrix. In Pro Mode, the game begins at level 5. Additionally, bombs fall in pairs. Despite this, the player is still playing to earn as many points as possible. Ice cubes and mines appear normally.Multiplay ModeA two player, split-screen game of Wetrix. Each player is given a game board of their own to play a game of Wetrix on. Whichever player's drain fills first loses. By evaporating water, each player can build up an attack meter across the bottom of their screen. Then, depending on how much power has been built up, players can either send ice cubes, water, an earthquake or bombs to affect the other player's game.Handicap ModeIn Handicap games, special rules are in play that affect the board. With each level up, the rules will be reapplied.Ice Layer A/BThe game begins with a layer of ice on the board. After a short amount of time, it will begin thawing. At level up, all water on the board is replaced with the ice layer.Raised Land A/BThe Earthquake Meter is partially filled at the beginning of the game and cannot be lowered. At level up, the floor raises slightly.Random LandThe game begins with various parts of the board raised to varying small degrees. At level up, the board partially resets; all pieces disappear and the land is reset, however the random areas of the land that are raised are determined by what areas of the board had pieces placed down before the level up.Random HolesThe game begins with several bomb holes already in the board. At level up, all water disappears, a new set of bomb holes are placed in the ground and the player is given a set of uppers to repair them before more water returns.Half-Full DrainThe drain begins half-filled at the start of the game. At level up, the drain will reset to its half-filled state, regardless of how much water was there before.Challenge ModeIn Challenge games, the player is presented with highly demanding game scenarios, but is also given a rare \"win\" condition. High scores are generally much more difficult to attain in this mode than any other.1-Minute ChallengeThe game only lasts for one minute. However, the game begins at level 10.5-Minute ChallengeThe game only lasts for five minutes. However, the game begins at level 4.100-Piece ChallengeOnly 100 pieces fall before the game is over. However, the game begins at level 8.500-Piece Challenge500 pieces fall before the game is over. However, the game begins at level 4.Preset A/BThe game begins at level 1 and proceeds like a normal game of Wetrix in Classic Mode. However, the pieces always fall according to a preset pattern. When the pattern is complete, the game ends.Practice ModeIn Practice Mode, the player can choose between playing a practice game of Wetrix or playing through one of eight tutorials.The practice game plays like a normal game of Wetrix, but removes the rain, levels (and, consequently, ice cubes and mines) and falling pieces. The player can still fill the drain and lose, but is given a more slower-paced environment to practice strategies.The tutorials teach the player basic game mechanics, preparing them for the first few levels of Classic Mode. The player can play the tutorials normally, or in a split-screen view, with a computer-controlled demo playing alongside them, showing a possible, if not recommended way to complete the tutorial.[CR]",

The objective of the game is to kill the other team of worms with a variety of conventional and bizarre weaponry - varying from shotguns to exploding sheep.[CR]Weaponry[CR]Axe: Takes half of a worm's health off but will not kill a worm unless they are on one HP.Handgun: Only a maximum damage of 30; however, players get Five shots.Uzi: Does a maximum damage of 50.Shotgun: Very effective at close range and can fire more than once in a turn.Minigun: Upgrade to the Uzi and does maximum of 75 damage.Longbow: Can be used to knock opponents off edges. Players get two shots with the longbow.Prod: Does no damage and only moves the enemy a small amount.Suicide Bomber: If used, the worm will blow themselves up. This does a tiny bit of damage but also releases fumes that make the enemy sick.Kamikaze: launch the worm in enemy\u2019s direction. Does maximum of of 30 damage.Air Strike: Missiles dropped from the air. The angle of the strike can be chosen and each missile does a maximum of 25 damage.Napalm Strike: Napalm missiles dropped from the air which will explode into napalm above the ground coving it in fire. Napalm is affected by the wind.French Sheep Strike: Exploding sheep are dropped over an area and do large amounts of damage.Mine Strike: Drops 5 mines onto the landscape or onto enemies.Bazooka: Shoots a rocket which is affected by the wind. Can use this to hit worms who are in difficult places or behind cover.Homing Missile: A missile that homes onto enemies. Players select the area to be hit, then the power. The missile will automatically home in on this position.Homing Pigeon: Much like the Homing missile but does much more damage.Sheep Launcher: Launches an exploding sheep. They jump around before they explode; they do a maximum of 75 damage.Grenade: The power and length of fuse can be set to ensure maximum damage. Grenades tend to bounce around a lot and are useful for hitting worms hidden in holes.Cluster Bomb: Like the grenade but instead the bomb explodes into smaller cluster bombs which also explode. Only does 15 damage per cluster bomb and is well, pretty useless.Banana Bomb: One of the most powerful weapons in the game! The Banana Bomb is much like the Cluster bomb but it separates into 5 smaller banana bombs on contact. Each of these can do up too 100 damage.Earth Quake: Shakes the ground causing worms to fall off ledges and sometimes into the water.Fire Punch: A massive punch that and is useful for knocking worms off ledges or into explosive objects.Dragon Ball: Very similar to the fire punch but the worm launches it self towards the enemy and therefore does not have to be next to him to make it effective.Dynamite: One of the most likely the most used weapon and it's very simple: Just place the dynamite and run. Does a maximum of 75 damage.Mine: Places a mine on the ground which will be set off by any worm coming close to it. Can also be placed on top of worms to explode instantly (after a small countdown).Sheep: Lets loose a sheep which bounces along the land and can be exploded at any time.Super Sheep: Much like the normal sheep, however the super sheep can be controlled whilst in the air.Aqua Sheep: The same as the super sheep, except this can go underwater.Mortar: This has a huge range but is very inaccurate. Shoots a cluster bomb which explodes into further clusters of bombs doing a maximum of 15 damage each.Mole Bomb: Let loose a mole which borrows into the ground and can be detonated at any time. Useful at creating a quick shelter underground or to flush out worms already below ground.Mail Strike: Drops five letters onto enemies.Mole Squadron: A group of mole bombs dropped from the air, which behave like any other type of strike. However, they can be detonated at will.Blowtorch: Used to dig through the ground to create shelter. Can also be used to attack other worms at close range. Does a maximum of 35 Damage.Pneumatic Drill: Much like the blowtorch but can only dig vertically downwards.Girder: Creates a girder which will protect worms from incoming attack. Can also be used to reach inaccessible areas.Baseball Bat: Can knock worms off cliffs and does a maximum of 30 damage.Ninja Rope: A rope that can be used to swing along the landscape and reach inaccessible areas. Normally has unlimited uses and can be used to escape after a weapon has been places (mostly dynamite). Players can also drop weapons while using the ninja rope.Bungee: Used to bungee down the side of cliffs without taking any damage or ending the turn. Can be used for reaching inaccessible areas.Parachute: Can be used to jump large gaps in the terrain. Weapons can also be dropped while using a parachute. This is heavily affected by the wind.Teleport: Players select a location and then teleport there.Super Banana Bomb: Much like the banana bomb, but more powerful.Holy Hand Grenade: Much like the hand grenade, but does a huge amount of damage and can blow huge holes in the landscape.Flame Thrower: Shoots flames and does a maximum of 125 damage. The flame is affected by the wind.Salvation Army: Releases the forces of the salvation army (characters with drums). They move slowly along the ground and explode on their own after a while. Can also be detonated at will before this.Priceless Ming Vase: Places an ancient vase from the Ming Dynasty on the playing field which explodes.Petrol Bomb: Much like napalm, but on a much smaller scale. Once the petrol bomb explodes it releases fire, which burns the landscape and any worms present.Skunk: Releases a skunk. The skunk runs along the landscape and releases gas. This makes all worms in the area ill, causing them to lose health each turn.Scales of Justice: Redistributes the health of all worms on a team, making them all equal.Carpet Bomb: Releases carpets from the air which behave like any other air strike, but once they hit the ground, they can bounce and explode up to five times.Mad Cow: Launches a cow along the ground, which explodes after a certain amount of time. It does up to 50 damage.Old Woman: Players release and old woman that causes a maximum of 75 damage.Concrete Donkey: Drops a massive concrete donkey from the sky. Once it hits land, it stomps around destroying everything until it reaches the sea.Patsy's Magic Bullet: Fires a silver bullet that functions like the Homing Missile, however, its flight path is extremely accurate and much more sensitive to the contour of the terrain.Indian Nuclear Test: Causes the water to rise and makes everybody on the map sick, losing 2 health after each turn.Armageddon: Destroys nearly everything with a randomized meteorite strikes. Although extremely destructive, it is possible to survive this attack.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR]General[CR]Worms World Party, the seventh game in the Worms series, was released in 2001.As with previous Worms games, its a side scrolling turn based strategy game where the player controls their team of well armed and athletic worms against up to 5 AI or player teams.The game has various modes, from a fairly simple deathmatch mode, to a mode where after each win, either a worm is taken off the team or a worm is added to an AI team, thus making it much more difficult and rewarding with each successive win. There is also a training mode to help perfect the art of a wind guided rocket shot, there's also a story mode and various fun multiplayer modes including online and offline local play with up to 6 players off and online.There is over 1000 game styles, and an infinite number of custom maps and game types may be added.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]For slimy invertebrates, the worms are very agile and skilled in the art of jumping, even doing a backflip jump to get onto even higher ledges, and among other things they are able to parachute and use ninja ropes to reach otherwise unreachable places.Weapons greatly range from a bog standard shotgun or handgun, to the much more fun to use banana bomb, sheep bomb, holy hand grenade and... The DONKEY, the Donkey is well.. a huge stone donkey that can be command to fall anywhere, bouncing up and down upon impact and blowing the general area to shit until it reaches water, usually taking a few unfortunate worms with it.Sudden Death occurs either after an Indian Nuke Test is used, when the game gets too long or after a player initiates it (local multiplayer only).[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Online worm fun is where it kicks off, from:creating custom team for online & offline modes,Name each team member and use any sort of soundsCan have a custom national anthem play upon winningUpon being shot worms will cry out in any accent of choosingGravestones are changeable and can even create custom gravestonesMapsSoundbites and pretty much everything from scratchSometimes players come across a team with a cock as their gravestone and harry potter sounds, which is always fun, and also create custom maps, be it a simple maze with explosive barrels everywhere, or for the more skilled and being savvy, create an awesome map like Pamela Anderson stretched out naked for the team of slimy critters to wriggle all over before blowing her bazooka's off with.. a bazooka. In general pretty much everything can be edited and personalized.Most online games involve frequent use of the ninja rope, the community has perfected their ninja skills, roping from one side of the landscape back and forth collecting items and zooming through impossible looking gaps to land gracefully on a ledge before dropping a dynamite and swinging off again.[CR]Shopper, WxW, Rope-race and Fly[CR]Pretty much every online match will consist of one or more of these game rules. All were made up by players, these rules don't have to be followed, but the other players can punish other players, as explained below.Shopper is a game type where:CBA (collect a crate before attacking)AFR (Attack From rope)KTL (Kill the leading player)ABL (Attack anyone except the one in last place)If a player breaks one or more of these rules then that player is the Cow. The other players should say \"Cow\" on the in-game chat to notify a break in the rules. The \"Cow\" will have to skip their next turn in accordance to the rules. If he or she doesn't skip, the other players may KTC (Kill the Cow) in which all players attack the Cow to remove him or her from the game and generally embarrass them.WxW is pretty much the same rules as a shopper game, except a lot more skill is required and must touch a certain number of walls before attacking, usually using a ninja rope, leaving very few precious seconds to attack before running out of time, if there's no damage to the player whilst swinging..Rope-Race is usually played in a maze style map containing a start point and a finish. It begins by placing worms at the start, no rope knocking (jumping from a rope to hit an enemy worm, usually into water) and first to the finish wins. Another version of this is Time-Trial Rope-Race, in this game type, there is no timer to complete the level. Once all worms have had a single turn, whoever made it to the finish in the least amount of time wins and is hailed champ!!Fly, Like WxW, Fly is based on the same rules as a Shopper game, but an extra rule FBA (Fly before attacking) is added. The player must \"Fly\" over the center point of the map using a parachute or ninja rope, or any other way the player manages to do so, it will most likely be a high or wide object. Techniques of flying include letting go of the ninja rope just after bouncing off a wall to send the worm flying, or swinging around a loose pixel created from an explosion.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]WWP has 60 Weapons and utilities in all including:Bazooka - Standard weapon with infinite ammo in most game modes, wind speed and direction strongly effects it.Grenade - Can be tossed in any direction. Player is able to set the timer from 1-5 seconds, no wind effects.Cluster bomb - A red grenade that scatters a cluster of explosions upon detonation.Mine - Proximity mine that can be dropped anywhere. When a worm gets near, it explodes unless its a dud.Banana Bomb - Same as cluster bomb only with bananas that are much more powerful and bounce.Shotgun - The only weapon that can be fired twice in each round, good for taking down two low health enemies.Uzi - Spray of bullets, not very useful for killing but good for knocking enemies into water or barrels.Dynamite - Very powerful but cannot be thrown, but can be dropped from a rope or parachute.Sheep - A Fluffy little sheep that packs a powerful punch when detonated.Homing Missile - Affected by wind, like a bazooka but it travels to where the cursor is placed.Air strike - Can be launched from anywhere in the level. 5 missiles that fall from the sky onto the player's target.Girder - Allows the worm to place a horizontal, Diagonal or vertical platform anywhere in mid-air.Blowtorch - Can be used to burn other worms or burn a tunnel into the terrain.Fire Punch - A vertical melee attack that cuts through terrain.Dragon Ball - A horizontal, close quarters attack.Kamikaze - The worm sacrifices its own life, if aimed correctly, can take out another player, cuts through terrain.White Flag - Used to give up and therefore lose the game.Ninja Rope - Allows a worm to climb, swing, and rappel around the terrain.

Ending turn upon arrival.Holy Hand Grenade - Huge explosion causing a lot of damage to any worm unfortunate to be in range.Pneumatic Drill - Only useful for drilling holes to hide in, or drilling through an enemies squishy head.Mortar - Can't control the power of this as it just fires straight, pretty hard to use with no prior knowledge of how this works.Super Sheep - Like sheep except another press of the action key/button makes it fly and controllable in mid-air.Cattle Prod - Extremely low damage, just a little poke, mostly used for humor to poke enemies over a ledge into water.Napalm - Like air strike but with fire, strongly affected by wind.Homing Pigeon - Similar to the homing missile, the pigeon is better as it can move to avoid colliding with scenery and can reach tighter places.Letter Bomb - Like Napalm and Air Strike but it drops several letters/envelopes causing large explosions, strongly affected by wind also.Longbow - Mid Damage ranged weapon, inaccurate at range.Handgun - Causes small damage to worms and terrain, not worth using unless as a last resort or to finish off an enemy.Mini-gun - Powerful enough to create a worm sized hole in the terrain and if every bullet hits.. maybe to kill.Battle Axe - Close range, low power melee weapon.Mole - Mole Jumps and burrows into land, it also explodes.Mad Cow - Release a troop of timed cows, each causing a massive explosion.Old Lady - Slow but deadly old woman, detonate for huge explosion.Baseball Bat - Smack a worm and watch it fly, great to use at the start to get rid of one full health worm via water.Bungee - Jump from a ledge using this, and will hang there like a worm on a fishing hook, doesn't use move and can drop explosives.Fast Walk - Exactly what it says, lets the worms travel faster for one turn.Skip Go - If hiding safely in a hole, use this to skip the move.Low Gravity - Lets the worm jump higher and further.Jet pack - A jet pack with a limit of 30 flight time, continuous flight would be about 7 seconds.Worm Select - Gives the ability to switch between worms and then attack.Skunk - Like all animals its explosive, but as this releases toxic gas from its arse that makes all infected worms lose 5 health each turn, the explosion is smaller.Donkey - A huge concrete donkey that falls where it is command to, blows up terrain with each impact and bounces straight up and down until it reaches water, on smaller fort maps this could take out the whole enemy team.Indian Nuclear Test - Sudden Death, Rising water and poison water, get too close to the water and get sick, combined with sudden death its lethalSuicide Bomber - Best used for the player's favorite enemy and it is self detonated, if that isn't enough it also infects the enemy with sickness(same as skunk).Sheep Launcher - Launches sheep resulting in massive terrain and worm damage, Best shot high to avoid bouncing past the enemy.Aqua Sheep - Exactly like Super sheep but can also go underwater.Molotov/Petrol Bomb - Explodes on impact causing a small or large area of log lasting flame, depending on the surface its thrown on, it can spread quite a bit.Flame thrower - Affected by wind, shoots flames, great for damaging and moving worms over a ledge or closer to a barrel to then explode, Short range.Laser Target - Gives team a dotted aim line, great for sniping with a shotgun.Invisibility - Online only, makes the worm invisible to the enemies.Earthquake - Only use this if the worms are in a safe place, not near mines, water or high falls, shakes terrain usually resulting in worms going for a swim.Mine Strike - Drops 5 Mines onto the player's target, mines bounce and scatter on landing.Mole Squadron - 5 moles dropped where the player chooses, excellent if the player wants some holes dug, moles explode on impact after digging (either dig into water or drop into an underground cave and explode).Scales of Justice - Adds 2 teams health together and splits it evenly, good for stealing health from enemy worms.Super Banana Bomb - Like cluster Bomb, only with the super powerful Banana, after initial explosion 5 more bananas emerge.French Sheep Strike - 5 Sheep fall where the players want, really funny to watch.Priceless Ming Vase - Ming Vase AKA Super Dynamite, pretty much the same but more powerful.Carpet Bomb - 5 exploding and powerful Carpets/Rugs where the player command, more efficient than French Sheep.Magic Bullet - Even more advanced than the homing pigeon, this beast will find its target, unless they're hiding in an underground cavern.[CR]System Requirements[CR]Pentium 100MHz (Minimum)Pentium 200MHz (Recommended)Windows 95/98/Me/XP2X CD-ROM Drive (Minimum)8X CD-ROM Drive (Recommended)32Mb RAM (Minimum)4MB DirectX compatible Graphics Card (Minimum)DirectX compatible Sound CardInternet Connection (optional)[CR]",
