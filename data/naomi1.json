Sega first demonstrated NAOMI publicly at the 1998 Amusement Machine Show (an annual trade show hosted in Tokyo by the Japan Amusement Machinery Manufacturers Association). After the show, Sega released the first NAOMI title to the Japanese market: The House of the Dead 2.[CR]NAOMI uses some of the same electronic components as the Dreamcast home game console.  However, NAOMI has twice as much system memory, twice as much video memory, and four times as much sound memory.[CR]Some NAOMI titles read game data from a GD-ROM optical disc, which is also the Dreamcast software medium. Game data can also be stored in a 168-megabyte bank of solid-state ROM. GD-ROM support requires a specialized DIMM board in addition to the GD-ROM drive.[CR]A modified version of the NAOMI was used for the Sammy Atomiswave.",

Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.[CR]Guilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.",

This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.[CR]When an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.[CR]The game features a two-player mode.

                "plot": "Rhythm Tengoku is a rhythm game developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released on August 3, 2006, and was the last game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. An arcade version of the game was reprogrammed and published by Sega on September 20, 2007. Both versions were released in Japan exclusively. The game has spawned three sequels; Rhythm Heaven, Rhythm Heaven Fever, and Rhythm Heaven Megamix. It began as an idea created by its composer and supervisor Tsunku who proposed it to Nintendo due to his belief that they could do a better job with it than he could.[CR]Rhythm Tengokus gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm (in some rhythm games as a character) until the end where they are given a score based on their performance. The gameplay and music were both well received by critics and consumers. Parallels have been drawn between it and the developer's previous work on the WarioWare series.",

The game naturally playes in a familiar manner with the usual gameplay mechanics in place, but it's the extra details that make Sega Tetris such a fun title. The addiction of bizarre cartoon characters that dance and gyrate by the play board as you move the Tetriminos around is interesting, and the way they hit the blocks to destroy any lines you make can be amusing.",

X-ism is a simple style based on Super Street Fighter II Turbo, in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single, but powerful, Super Combo move. The third style, V-ism (or variable style), a unique style that allows the player to perform Custom Combos similar to the ones in Street Fighter Alpha 2. In X-ism, players cannot air-block nor use Alpha Counters.  The game also introduces a Guard Power gauge which depletes each time the player blocks - everytime the gauge is completely depleted, the player suffers a \"guard crush\" (in which the gauge itself decreases in size, thus causing the player to gradatively lose ability to block attacks as the guard gauge keeps decreasing) which leaves him/her temporarily vulnerable for an attack.",

The game can be played in four different screen modes, with one mode mimicking the narrow arcade version. A ship from Triangle Service's previous release, XII Stag, is hidden in the game and can be unlocked by holding the X button before selecting a stage in Stage Attack mode. The power-ups can be used to upgrade each separate weapon respectively.[CR]There are 6 levels in the game, they get progressively harder until the last stage which consists of only two bosses. Two unlockable modes become available when the game is completed, they are Omake mode and Lifting mode. Omake mode is a short level which has denser bullet patterns than the normal game, lifting mode is where you have to juggle a stone on your ship to score points",

You actually get to ride a replica of a Yamaha WaveRunner on water, while you race against other 7 other opponents. The game plays like Sega Rally Championship around some veins, but does something different which makes the game fresh, such as riding on a jet ski instead of cars. The game also relies on doing tricks on ramps which somewhat affects your scoring. There are three courses in game, ranging from Novice (beginner course), Intermediate (advanced course), and the Expert course.",
