This is the same platform, converted to the cheaper CD format.  The unit's 1X CD-ROM drive is slow, with very long loading times of up to 56 Mbit of data per load. The system can also play Audio CDs. All three versions of the system have no region-lock.[CR]The Neo Geo CD was launched bundled with a control pad instead of a joystick like the AES version. However, the original AES joystick can be used with all three Neo Geo CD models.[CR]Developer:  SNK[CR]Manufacturer:  SNK[CR]CPU:  Motorola 68000[CR]Memory:  64KB RAM, 74KB VRAM[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2610[CR]Display:  320x224[CR]Media:  CD[CR]Max.

However, his crescent blade hasn't touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it won't be long before hewould fall. \"Fool, you will become one of my family\" resounded the opponent's voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand.[CR]The Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggest. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.",

After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.",

One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the \"charge meter\", which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. \"Charge moves\" are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.[CR]The characters and stages are inspired by the Double Dragon movie featured prominently in the game's intro. This includes the appearances of a submerged Hollywood, the Dragon Mobile vehicle, Billy and Jimmy's ability to transform themselves and the inclusion of Koga Shuko as the game's final boss. However, the game's characters are depicted in a more anime-like style and only six of the game's twelve fighters are actually featured in the movie; Burnov and Duke are from previous Double Dragon games and rest were created specifically for this game. This game is dedicated to Kaneto Shiozawa, who died in 2000 and Daisuke Gri, who died in 2010.",

Now Terry, Andy, Joe, Mai and Geese are back in South Town to battle five new characters and three bosses. All of them have their own reasons of coming to South Town, but in the end, everything links to a scroll that reveals the secret to the lost ancient martial arts.[CR]Fatal Fury 3 was a pretty big improvement over its predecessors, introducing brand new re-drawn character sprites (yet again) and better overall animation quality. Of course, a handful of colorful new characters join the roster, in addition to some new 2D environments.[CR]The two-plane gameplay was upgraded to a three plane format known as the Oversway System. Players fight primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or \"oversway\" into either of the sway lines at the background or foreground . Attacks between planes have returned but are now called \"Oversway Attacks\" and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special & super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round.[CR]Along with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they'll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both. Overall,  Fatal Fury 3  was easily the best presentation of the series to date.",

There are no real world teams to contend with, and no real world stats that matter aside from the game's score and the game's time. There are also no substitutions.[CR]Football Frenzy uses the Neo Geo's sprite scaling capabilities to provide either panned out or close in views depending on the action going on. The game is played from a top down perspective, but tilted to an angle so player profiles are more easily visible. Only a small portion of the field is visible at any time; to aid in orientation the game provides both a wireframe field with the current viewable portion indicated on the bottom of the screen, and a bar with sliding coloring indicating the current ball position on the field.",

Lo and behold, Data East had the audacity to make a sequel a year after the release of the original, even after Capcom tried to sue them for ripping off SF2.[CR]Fighter's History Dynamite (also known as Karnov's Revenge) is at least an improvement over the original. The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie & Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn't changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay.[CR]While playing Karnov's Revenge, there's just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn't offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre. Although, you could unlock a special fight against a bull if you beat the game without losing a single round, but who the hell would want to play this game for that long?",

Rugal has his secretary travel to eight destinations around the world and invite fighters to his new tournament. Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality, participating this time. Most characters come from other SNK games, such as Team Italy, which is composed of three heroes from the original Fatal Fury: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi. The two heroes from Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia) are featured along with their mentor and Ryo's father (Takuma Sakazaki) make up Team Mexico. Team Korea features Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury 2 as the leader of two convicts he's trying to reform Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, while Team England is a mix of female fighters from Fatal Fury 2 (Mai Shiranui) and the Art of Fighting series (Yuri Sakazaki, King). The two heroes from Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou) form Team China along with their mentor, Chin Gentsai. Similarly, Team Brazil features the heroes from Ikari Warriors (Ralf and Clark) along with their commanding officer Heidern. Additionally, the game features two teams composed entirely of original characters: Team Japan featuring Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon, and Team USA composed of Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler.",

Each level consists of a short side-scrolling portion in which the player's monster must deal with things like attacking tanks and ships. At the end of the side scrolling portion the alien boss monster appears for a fight.[CR]The buildings and vehicles in the stages sometimes give up certain items when destroyed. The best type to collect is the power-up icon; up to two of these can be collected to boost the monster's strength. There are also icons that make monsters move faster or slower, drain collected power-up levels, explode for damage, or just provide points. Accumulated power-up levels carry over into subsequent stages.",

                "plot": "In 2028, General Donald Morden launches an all-out, global attack against the Regular Army. With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily.[CR]The attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high-ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army's intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever.[CR]Meanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile.[CR]The announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named \"Resistants\" are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat-ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter-offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks.[CR]Seeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion.[CR]The player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and \"Metal Slug\" tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.[CR]The protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.[CR]During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.[CR]There are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases.",

It is up to the Peregrine Falcon squad, who are now joined by two new characters: Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina Germi of the Sparrows Intelligence Unit, to save the day.[CR]As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden has allied with Martians to help facilitate his plans. In the final level of the game, the tables are turned when Morden comes under attack and is betrayed by his Martian allies and taken prisoner by them. An ad-hoc alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon squad and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat. After a long battle, they succeed in defeating the Martians' Mothership, driving them off the Earth. Morden seems to have fallen from the ship, strapped to a solid iron plate. While his soldiers celebrate, the plate loses its balance and crushes him.",

All the characters in Ninja Master's fight with their weapon of choice, but you can freely choose to put your weapon away and go mano a mano. This does not have a major impact on speed or attack power, but changes the movesets significantly changing the way even basic attacks work.[CR]Uses 2D sprite-based graphics and features 1P or 2P Vs gameplay.",

In terms of weapons-based fighters, theres no comparing this game with the brilliant 3D visuals and the fluid offensive-and-defensive gameplay of last years Soul Caliber III, they are of different decades. The original Samurai Shodown came to market the same year as the first Mortal Kombat, and though it offered no finishing moves, the screen was frequently painted red with the arterial spray of blood from the losing character.[CR]In this fifth iteration of Samurai Shodown, however, some of that intensity, and blood, isnt as prevalent. There are a total of 26 characters to choose from, and the series best are represented --  Haohmaru, Hanzo, Jubei, Genjuro, Nakaruru (and her bird). Of course, it wouldnt be an SNK title if there werent some truly bizarre characters as well. Kusaregedo, an oversized mutant with a purple vomit attack, would be a more appropriate character for Ghost Hunter. And true-to-form, the story mode ultimately pits you against Gaoh an overlord who has (wait for it) demon-transformation powers.",

The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.",

The regular mode is like the single-player mode of other fighting games, except that players don't square off against one character.[CR]Instead, players will face off against groups of three characters at a time. Players will fight each character for one round, with the requirement for advancing being to win two of the three rounds. After fighting five sets of three characters, players then face a series of characters in single combat until the ending fight with Zeus.",
