The initial game, which did the rounds on ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and the like, spawned a flurry of clones and sequels, eventually reaching the Game Gear with this unlikely installment in which CJ has been falsely accused and sentenced to imprisonment in London Zoo--not usually an institution known for its efforts in punitive confinement.[CR][CR]CJ rises to the challenge over six equally implausible levels\u2019 worth of peanut-spitting and umbrella-parachuting, culminating in his triumphant return to the African savanna--where presumably he is ostracized for his clothes-wearing, umbrella-twirling ways.",

Like its Nintendo counterpart, you sprinted down the asphalt, bumping, grinding, and exchanging item-based attacks.[CR][CR]Sonic Drift 2 was a big step up from the first. It had seven characters over the original\u2019s four, more varied tracks, and featured much more aggressive AI. Dr. Robotnik\u2019s Egg Mobile was still pretty dominant though. It made you wonder why Sonic didn\u2019t just get out and run.",

The main Mickey sprite is large and full of expression, with the environments appropriately bold and detailed, demonstrating just how far Sega had come in terms of getting the most out of the hardware since Castle of Illusion a couple of years beforehand.[CR][CR]But it's the level design that elevates Mickey above even Sonic to take the crown as Game Gear's best game. With an ever-expanding move set allowing the mouse to revisit previously-passed areas and discover hidden items, the game even has longevity beyond the final boss as you seek out every last hidden bonus in search of the perfect completion run. The soundtrack is full of some of the 8-bit machine's finest tunes and there are plenty of Disney cameos along the way too. They simply don't make 'em like this any more, which is a real shame. This is AAA-quality gaming, just in 32 colors on a tiny, fuzzy, 2D screen. And it's wonderful.",
