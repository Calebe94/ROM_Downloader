Many Americans overlooked the system as the NES ruled home gaming, while Sega saw huge success in the UK and the rest Europe, as well as very sustained popularity in Brazil. No matter where you experienced it, the Master System's library is worth remembering, not only for its place in Sega history, but for its surprisingly strong selection of games.[CR][CR][CR][CR]Thanks to console's extra long lifespan, the Master System saw a number of great originals along with some quality ports of arcade and Genesis hits like Sonic, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. The countdown begins with a particularly memorable Sega racer..",

Platformers were in ready supply on the SMS, but the comparatively human scale of Strider and adversaries give this one a realistic, even cinematic flair.",

But the latter never experienced the thrill of inching their way through U.S. Gold\u2019s unforgiving network of high-tech hurdles.[CR][CR]Conceived years before Tom Cruise revived the Mission: Impossible brand, this off-licence imitator nevertheless employed similar themes of infiltration and espionage, with the added emphasis on bottomless-pit peril that was de rigeur in platformers of the day. With its origins on home computers like the C64 and Amiga, Impossible Mission\u2019s particular flavor of single-screen platforming remains a tighter, more challenging proposition than many console-exclusive examples of the form.",
