During its years of absolute handheld dominance, the GBA produced some of the best games ever to hit the portable market. Many of them were ports of Super Nintendo games (which we're mostly leaving out of this collection), but plenty were able to stand up to the best of other consoles on their own merits. With so much quality to pick from, it's not easy to single out the 50 best. But we pulled it off, and here are the results...",

And a challenge it is: With more than 60 stages plus the usual unlockable score-attack minigames, it's a good thing the developer's come up with a control scheme that makes some allowance for the GBA's non-analog inputs.

Like the rest of the series, it's another excursion into a brightly colored anime dreamscape--the setting for a series of tight, imaginative 2D platforming challenges. Give it a whirl and rescue poor Klonoa from the ignominy of hosting his own Beach volleyball tournament",

A bizarre little action-platformer gem, Ninja Five-O (or Ninja Cop in the UK) had a lot in common with the original Shinobi games, as ninja officer Joe Osugi slashed and shurikened his way through bank robbers and terrorists--some of which had hostages, and many of which used some form of cover.[CR][CR]Never mind the action, the upgradable ninja powers or the maze-like levels, though. The game\u2019s real appeal came from its grappling hook, which clearly aped Bionic Commando, but added a little more flexibility and inertia, enabling you to do things like latch onto the bottom of a platform and swing over the head of a bad guy above, then shoot him on the way back down. It added a dimension of finesse and freedom that turned what might have otherwise been a dull side-scroller into something memorably great.",

No, but it did come together beautifully. The guns, enemies, levels, and feel were replicated splendidly, introducing a whole new group of gamers to the iconic world of demon-infested Mars. Add in deathmatch over link cables, and you\u2019ve got the best FPS on the GBA.",

The Mini-Marios march through Lemmings-like stages, and you're responsible for building a path to safety for the little guys.

Time for a remake, surely.[CR][CR]Few titles have managed the kind of handheld success story represented by Pokemon: Beside providing a new billion-dollar IP for Nintendo, the original, monster-collecting Game Boy releases (and accompanying anime) captured public attention in a way few video games have done before or since.

It was also extra-hard, even by the standards of older Mega Man games. Despite this, Zero proved popular enough to get three sequels on the GBA.

Better still, once you\u2019d finished the original story, Zero Mission added an entirely new chapter in which Samus is stripped of her armored suit and has to sneak through a Space Pirate ship while relatively defenseless. And if you decided you didn\u2019t like the changes (or just wanted to play the original), Zero Mission included the NES version of Metroid as an unlockable.

It\u2019s still a pretty big deal, actually, if you consider what a challenge it must have been adapting Pro Skater\u2019s kick-flipping, rail-grinding 3D action to a 2D handheld. THPS2 pulled it off brilliantly, though, delivering an isometric, kinda-3D-looking game that felt uncannily like its console counterparts.[CR][CR]The sense of gravity, the responsiveness of the tricks, the depth of gameplay, and even the layouts of the levels were all carried over faithfully from the real THPS2. Sure, it could sometimes be a little hard to make out whether certain objects were convex or concave, and one of the console version\u2019s biggest selling points--its soundtrack--was necessarily left out. But the gameplay was all there, and it was proof positive that the GBA was going to deliver some amazing things in the years that followed.",

The Final Fantasy IV conversion was actually a bit sloppy, and you've already heard about how much we liked FF6. Final Fantasy V Advance gets added kudos for being a strong port of an already-strong game. More importantly, it marked the first time FF5 appeared on its own in the US, as the original entry never made it out of Japan and a later PlayStation release bundled the game with FF6 (and a sub-par translation).[CR][CR]Even without this historical footnote, FF5 has our respect for employing one of the best job systems of all time. Even though the story and characters were silly, the underlying gameplay was more addicting than any other Final Fantasy game to date; instead of predetermined protagonists, you could create a custom-built team of heroes who could adapt to any challenge. This feature was introduced in FF3 (which also languished in Japan until 2006), but FF5 evolved it and made it truly notable. Sure, the job system takes some of the characters' personality away, but hey, we\u2019ve got eight other FF games chock full of defined characters--who cares if one values gameplay over story?",

If you could get all the needed elements together, it was possible to swipe special cards through the e-Reader and transfer new items, levels, developer play-throughs, and even gameplay elements from other Mario games into SMA4. Being able to play through SMB3 with Super Mario World\u2019s cape feather, or the throwable turnips of SMB2, breathed new life into the game and helped make SMA4 much more than just another remake.",

Strong enough to spawn its own GameCube sequel, too. Of course, the real draw was still A Link to the Past, which held up remarkably well for a then-10-year-old (and now over 20-year-old) game.

That all changed when FE star Marth appeared in million-seller Super Smash Bros. Melee, after which tons of English-speakers heard of the series and wanted a taste. So Nintendo made sure that the next installment for the GBA would finally give the series some international exposure.[CR][CR]Made by Intelligent Systems, Fire Emblem shares a similar top-down map and turn-based gameplay with IS\u2019s Advance Wars. The narrative focused on warring countries in a classic fantasy setting, and you had to learn the seemingly simple rock-paper-scissors-style advantages and disadvantages of every class to stand a chance. Some no doubt disliked the fact that if a character died in a fight, they were gone forever, so every mistake either meant accepting that loss or completely restarting an hour-long battle. Ultimately, though, that loss made every decision hugely important. And isn\u2019t that the whole point of a strategy game?",

Despite those doubts, Super Circuit encapsulated that classic gameplay by combining new ideas with much of what made previous entries great.[CR][CR]The racing was the same simplistic car combat that featured racers blasting one another with shells and banana peels, and the race tracks were just as familiar. The game had 20 new tracks, but it earned the Super in the title by recreating all 20 courses from the original Super Mario Kart. And while the prerendered graphics haven\u2019t aged too well, the racing remains as tight as ever.",

Blazing fast and brilliantly 2D, it nailed all the core elements that made Sonic great, even if it did feature Tails and Amy Rose as playable characters.[CR][CR]Not even Sonic\u2019s usual menagerie of sidekicks could ruin this one, though. (And to be fair, playing as them could be kind of fun.) Sporting slick new sprites and smooth animation, it had everything that made the 16-bit Sonic games great: the intense speed, the giant levels that could be freely explored or just blasted through in seconds, and the simple joys of jumping on springs and tearing ass through loops. It also featured the tiny chao garden mode, enabling you to transfer your teardrop-headed Chao virtual pets between Sonic Advance and the GameCube Sonic Adventure games. As interesting as that is, though, it\u2019s the simple, near-perfect hedgehog action that makes this one great.",

A product of the combined efforts of 2D-gaming gods Treasure and Crazy Taxi creators Hitmaker, Omega Factor was enormously fun, deep, and generally much better than any cartoon-licensed game really has a right to be.[CR][CR]That\u2019s partly because Omega Factor wasn\u2019t a licensed game in the strictest sense. It featured Astro Boy and his usual cast of supporting characters, but produced an entirely new, surprisingly dark story that revolved around time travel and included just about every character ever invented by legendary Astro Boy creator Osamu Tezuka. The actual gameplay was great as well, mixing together platforming, brawling, and space-shooting, frequently all at the same time. Given that the GBA was host to a seething mass of (mostly) mediocre licensed games, it\u2019s not a stretch to call this the best one on the system.",

If you\u2019ve played WarioWare, however, you already know just how endlessly fun the concept is: An assortment of microgames, each about 2-3 seconds in length, flashes before you in rapid succession. The challenge comes from figuring each one out (usually from a one-word hint, like Pick!) before the time runs out, after which you move on to the next.[CR][CR]While that might sound pretty bare-bones to someone who\u2019s never played WarioWare (you know there has to be someone out there), the concept turned out to be rich in personality, with each microgame collection built around coherent characters, themes, and (simple) storylines. The microgames themselves, meanwhile, are hugely varied and numerous, and yet they\u2019re usually weird enough to stick out in players\u2019 minds for years afterward.",

That X-factor was Luigi.[CR][CR]The interplay between the brothers was fantastic, whether juxtaposing Mario\u2019s courage with Luigi\u2019s cowardice, or using their numerous special abilities in and out of battle. The two guys were as malleable as Silly Putty, and whether it\u2019s Luigi squishing Mario to half his size, or Mario somehow turning Luigi into a surfboard, the title was exceptional because of those two working together. It was only improved by a top-of-the-line translation that always kept the game funny, and a copious amount of Mario fan-service. And don\u2019t even get us started on the supremely awesome bad guy Fawful. Even though it stars the most familiar plumbers on earth, Mario and Luigi was one of the most original games the GBA saw.",

While not being able to transfer your shiny Gyarados was a huge bummer at the time, we have Ruby and Sapphire to thank for the richness and depth we continue to enjoy in the series today.",

Circle of the Moon was an amazing (if hard-to-see) launch game, and Harmony of Dissonance had some nice visuals, but Castlevania\u2019s real pinnacle didn\u2019t come along until Aria of Sorrow. Set in the year 2035, it focused on a new hero, Soma Cruz, who by the end of the game was revealed as nothing less than a reincarnation of longstanding series villain Dracula.[CR][CR]As, essentially, a reformed Dracula, Soma brought a unique approach to the action, in that he gained new powers and attacks by absorbing the souls of defeated enemies. He was also capable of things the previous GBA games\u2019 whip-wielding heroes couldn\u2019t do, like flying, summoning monsters, and shooting guns. Really, though, everything about Aria of Sorrow was an improvement over the previous games--the visuals looked better, the characters were more interesting, and the play was much more varied, making this easily the best installment of one of the GBA\u2019s most iconic series.",

And even though it came before, Fusion was arguably even more impressive than Zero Mission. Chronologically the last game in the series, it gave Metroid a little more personality than we\u2019re used to, adding a secondary character--Samus\u2019s computer, Adam--and a more coherent story that sees Samus set loose in a space-research station filled with evolving, creature-mimicking X-parasites.[CR][CR]Samus herself got a new look for the adventure, although there was more to it than just adding blue glop to her costume. An X-parasite infection early on in the story forces doctors to fuse her DNA with the baby Metroid\u2019s. This grants her the ability to absorb parasites after destroying their host bodies, which in turn is key to earning new abilities. It was a more conventional turn for the series, but it was fun, and it helped make Fusion one of the greatest revivals of a classic series the GBA ever saw.",

Curmudgeonly Ezlo, the titular Minish Cap, is one of Link's most loveable companions, too. To this day it remains Link's best portable adventure.",

Instead of controlling fanciful mages and paladins, you manufacture and deploy all manner of ground-, air-, and sea-based combat units, like infantry, tanks, missiles, transport copters, bombers, fighters, subs, and so on.[CR][CR]Despite the array of weaponry at your disposal though, the CO characters are really what set Advance Wars apart. Not only are the COs endearing and memorable as characters, but each wields special powers to suit your personal playstyle. For heavy-hitting brute force you could go for direct combat specialist Max, or if you'd rather infiltrate and capture enemy resources to succeed, you could go with infantry specialist Sami. Some tactical games fall into the trap of having an optimal strategy you can exploit again and again, but experimenting with each CO's power really does yield results. The difficulty level is spot-on, too--Advance Wars manages to be nails-tough without being punishing, which is a rare feat among its peers.",
