It is a remake of an text adventure game for ZX-spectrum that has been created by a Czech programmer Frantisek Fuka (Fuxoft) in year 1985. I just polished the original idea and made better GUI so it would be easier to play this just by mouse.[CR]Controls:[CR]- mouse for selecting commands and objects from list[CR]- arrows for quick access to north, south, west and east directions[CR]Do not give up easily. There are lots of death traps, places you can get stuck when using items incorrectly and some red herrings. Game can be ended in more than one way! You get score and number of turns at the end when you get to the finish room. Have fun!"

But worry not, because you are going to fix things now and defeat the great evil you unleashed upon the world.[CR]It's turn-based, so you have as long as you want to think things through and even in the heat of battle our monsters are well trained to wait, seemingly forever, until you have taken your turn.[CR]You start at the shores of Riverside with barely no equipment, a laughable budget and a desire for fame, fortune and making the world a better place. Let's see how this works out for you.[CR]Printable world map: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-9d8MZCrX5cdGBQ0LVlgSxD2lK6vp_zd[CR]This project is open source.

To test that it's working, reload the page after the intro screen. If you see \"Save OK\" on the top left, savegames are working.

To interact with things, just walk into them (huts, fountains, doors, etc, etc).[CR]1. To rest, use food rations: press Z to open menu, select ITEMS, select the food ration, press Z and select USE.[CR]2. Always carry plenty of food. Buy them in General Stores.[CR]3. Always carry plenty of torches to light dark caves and dungeons. Also found in General Stores.[CR]4. Upgrade equipment! You won't go very far with just a dagger and no armor.[CR]5. Save at every opportunity. Fountains and inns allow you to save.[CR]6. Beware of unidentified items. They may be cursed, explode, release poison gas, and all sorts of other bad effects. Plus, if you equip a cursed item, you won't be able to remove it.[CR]7. When you get enough XP, go to a town to train to level up. You will know you have enough XP because the XP meter on the bottom right will be highlighted with an up arrow.[CR][ TECHNICAL DETAILS ][CR]The game engine is 64K of Lua code but the core of the game's logic is written in XL, an assembly-like language I created, which assembles to bytecode that gets put into the cart's Map memory banks (banks 6 and 7). You can look at the XL source code in https://github.com/btco/so12l/tree/master/xl .

[CR]    V/1 - Brush tool. Revives/kills a single cell (using left/right mouse buttons -- can be made bigger/smaller with W and S)[CR]    R/C/L - Rectangle/Circle/Line tools.[CR]    2-6 - Pattern tool, which gives you some premade patterns you can use.[CR]    F - Fill tool[CR]    E - Toggle draw/eraser mode.[CR]About the UI: top left is the number of generations that have passed. Top right is number of cells: living/dead/total. Bottom left is zoom level and mouse position.[CR]If you hate the spacing around the cells, press P, or edit the code in TIC-80 and change the 'use_padding' variable to 'false', to disable it permanently. I placed a few useful variables, like that one, near the top of the code.[CR]Have fun!"
