Menu graphics were similarly digitized.  Game graphics were 3-D polygon, however. Depending on system setup, sound was either PC speaker or produced through your sound card, if you had one.  Players could fly missions as single, one-off flights or fly those same missions in a sequence in the game's campaign. As the game was released during the    Cold War, the stock campaign took place in a fictional conflict in Eastern   Europe after the Warsaw Pact attacks NATO. The campaign was not fully dynamic, but any characters and units prevented from destruction would be available to assist the player in later missions. On the other hand, if a friendly column of tanks was allowed to be overrun by     Soviet T-80's would not be handy in later missions to save the player from pesky SAM batteries.  Most missions involve protecting NATO ground forces from enemy tanks, which is exactly what the A-10 was designed to do. However, Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopters and MiG-27 Floggers make an appearance as well as air-to-air threats.  There were two expansion campaigns to follow. The first continued the Warsaw Pact/NATO conflict. The second, released after Desert Storm in 1991, took place over Kuwait and southern  Iraq.[CR]",

The game is licensed by ABC to use its namesake program, but not by the NFL or NFLPA; subsequently, all the teams have fake names.[CR]The game was originally released for home computers, appearing on the Amiga, PC and Commodore 64. A SNES port developed by Kuusou Kagaku came a few years later with some graphical enhancements.[CR]The game was followed by ABC Wide World of Sports Boxing, another sports game licensed by ABC and produced by Data East.

Handling was based on drifting around corners and slamming into opponents. The vehicles in ATR are all \"buggyish\" in their nature with a futuristic slant on the stylings. This futuristic styling was carried over into some of the assets in the level design leading you to think that the whole game was set in the near future. Unlike many of the top down racers of the time tracks had short cuts which added an element of strategy. As well as shortcuts tracks also had environmental hazards you had to avoid such as oil slicks and small jumps. Tracks also had turns that were not just 90 degrees in nature (a shortcoming of ATR's precursor Overdrive). Pickups such as turbos where littered about the track.Shopping for gearYou could also upgrade your car in ATR with advanced engines, gearing systems, tyres and fuel, all of which could be customised to the terrain you were racing in.ATR also was one of the first games to feature in game advertising. Admittedly all the advertising was for team 17's own games such as ALIEN BREED and BODY BLOWS but this was a precursor to the beast that is in game advertising nowadays.In game advertising circa 1995[CR]",

You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Willy Beamish is a point-and-click adventure game with several odd (especially at the time) game mechanics. It features the passage of time (certain events only take place at certain times of day) and Willy only has a certain amount of time to complete each \"block\" of time. It's a similar mechanic to that of Majora's Mask, albeit in a totally different genre. Secondly, the game features a \"trouble meter\" which indicates just how close Willy Beamish is to being sent to military school. If it fills up, the game is over.[CR]The game's universe is an odd mix of fantasy and reality, exemplified by one scene where Willy's babysitter turns out to be a practitioner of witchcraft. A puzzle-based boss battle ensues when she attempts to kill Willy and his sister.[CR]The game's cartoony look was accomplished by using hand-painted backgrounds and hand-animated sprites, like many adventure games of the era.[CR]Willy Beamish arguably pioneered the inclusion of everyday tasks in video games. Willy has to eat dinner and make conversation with his family, and at one point you have to disinfect and bandage your own finger after cutting it. It implements these tasks into the puzzle-solving elements of the game, and sometimes even make them integral to the plot.[CR]Willy Beamish's frog is named \"Horny\".[CR]Metagame[CR]Along with everyday mundane tasks, Willy can also head to his bedroom at most times to play the game-within-a-game: Monster Squad Super Space K'noidtrix for the Nintari game console. An interesting mix of Arkanoid and Tetris, puzzle-like pieces are thrown onto the playfield which must be avoided and destroyed before they stack up to the top of the screen. Several powerups can be shot and collected in the same manner as Arkanoid and can even be leveled up as rounds grow faster and harder. Combined with the peculiar soundtrack it makes for a decidedly Japanese feel in the middle of this Western-made game.[CR]System Requirements[CR]The original PC system requirements are:MS-DOS 5.0 or greater286 or better512 KB RAM8.5 MB Hard drive spaceVGAThunderboard Pro Aud Spectrum, AdLib, Roland MT-32/LAPC-1/CM-32L or SoundBlasterMouse[CR]",

The roadblocks can only be cleared by grenades which you pick up by knocking over traffic cones. You must also make it to the end of the level without running out of fuel.[CR]After the motorcycle levels there are five platform levels.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] The lamp level [CR]There were three different video game versions of Disney's Aladdin, two released within weeks of one another. One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.[CR]In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.[CR]The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, \"What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained...\".[CR]Danyon Carpenter wrote, \"...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation...\".[CR]",

In order to complete each level, the player has to have Alfred peck all of the balloons that are tied down in various parts of the levels.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]With the release of the Alien 3 film several games were released to tie into the film. With the Super Nintendo and Genesis as the leading platforms the game was built and ported to other systems, including the Commodore 64 and Game Gear. The games are set on the world of the film, Fury 161, but the gameplay actually has more in common with the film Aliens, throwing wave after wave of enemies at the player. Whereas in Alien 3 there was only one xenomorph.[CR]The video game versions (except the Nintendo Entertainment System) were praised at the time of its release for not sticking with the lack of guns and multiple aliens in the film, which was the film's most criticized aspects.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The SNES version had varied missions to complete.[CR]In the SNES version, Ripley begins the game in a corridor where she can operate a computer terminal which gives her access to various missions. Missions have Ripley completing objectives such as destroying groups of eggs, fixing pipes or junction boxes, isolating rooms, killing Alien Queens or rescuing trapped inmates. Completing these missions leads to the game's ending, which is closer to the movie than the other versions. Like most versions of the game, the SNES version was liberal with the material, generating waves of enemies to combat.[CR]Unlike the other versions of the game, health, ammo and enemies respawn during the levels.[CR]There are 6 levels in total, each having a range of missions in them. Since completing a level takes around half an hour to an hour, the levels can be accessed via a password system.[CR]The soundtrack is inspired on that of the film's, unlike the Genesis's more action game music. Complex orchestrations delivered by the SNES's sound chip accompany the game to give it a movie-like feeling.[CR]The graphics are also superior, having rich detail in the backgrounds and effects like smoke and rain occurring in parts of Fury 161. Ripley and her enemies have smooth animations and there are lighting effects on the scenery and/or the objects when using a flame thrower in egg rooms or closing a door.[CR]The SNES version was released after the movie, therefore it doesn't contain any deleted scenes or scenery present at the time of the other versions' developments.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]The Genesis version was a slightly different case. Instead of missions in a large, persistent area, the game uses stages (or levels) like many other platformers of the time. The majority of these see the player fighting their way through hordes of Aliens in order to rescue prisoners before the timer runs out. When the timer does run out, the player is show a scene of each of the remaining prisoners giving birth to a chestburster Alien. In addition to these rescue missions, there are other mission instances. Every few missions the player must fight a boss alien (and in the games finale, two at once) and occasionally, the player will have to rescue lots of prisoners, without interference from Aliens. As well as the opposite, having to shoot lots of Aliens and reach the exit without needing to rescue prisoners.Rescue the prisoners as fast as possible, before this happens.[CR]The game consists of roughly 20 missions, each increasing in difficulty and features several different locations from the movie (such as the prison grounds, the lead works, the slaughter house, the Alien nest, etc) and features a number of weapons commonly seen in the franchise (but ironically, none of which were seen in the actual film) the pulse rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher and hand grenades.[CR]In addition to this, the player is given health and battery pickups. The battery pickups allow the motion tracker in the top right hand corner of the screen to work for a short time, but once the battery has run out it reverts to being blank again until the player picks up another battery. Enemies include the ubiquitous Alien, as well as much later in the game Eggs and Facehuggers, in addition to the larger boss Aliens.[CR]Since the movie was subject to various creative inputs due to a lack of consent over the final script, many things were scrapped but some remained in the video game, such as the abattoir level (which is present in the recent Alien 3 Assembly Cut) and the fact that Ripley survives in the end.[CR]Master System, Game Gear, Amiga and Commodore 64 Versions[CR]The Master System and Game Gear versions are very similar to the Genesis version, the first few levels are exactly the same but with a major graphical downgrade. The player has access to largely the same arsenal of movements and weapons, as well as having a countdown clock and prisoners to rescue. Beyond the first few levels, they begin to differ slightly, but not much from the Genesis version of the game.[CR]The Commodore 64 version follows the same principle and scenery of the Genesis game, but with altered level design.[CR]The Amiga version looked and played similar to the Genesis version in terms of graphics but the player had to choose either to play the music or sound effects but not both.[CR]NES Version[CR]The NES version was developed by LJN LTD, and featured a drastically different visual style as well as gameplay mechanics. The graphics are indistinct, the Alien creatures appear to be vague shapes of solid color and the game world itself features a lot less detail than that of the Master System, or other versions. The game features a large HUD which occupies the bottom portion of the screen and displays information such as remaining ammunition. The game's sound effects were also a much lower quality than that of other versions. The game featured a variety of different mission locations taken from the film, and like the other versions the main objective throughout the game is to rescue prisoners on each level before proceeding to the exit.[CR]Though seen as a mediocre game at the time of its release, the game has been heavily criticized as time went by.[CR]",

Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.[CR]Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction. [CR]Other major bonuses found on the floor are emergency kits for restoring your health, and credits. The credits come in handy when you find an Infotex terminal. There, you can access information about your current mission and your vital statistics, as well as buy supplies such as ammunition, weapons and keys.[CR]Music is forfeited in this game, in favour of ambience sounds from machinery, machine gun sounds and the sounds of the aliens running around the base.",

A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]",

At the beginning of the first level, Zeus fires lightning into the ground, commanding a centurion to \"Rise from your grave!\" The centurion begins each level with a few attacks. He can perform a standard punch, a ducking punch, a jumping punch, a shin kick, a vertical kick, or a jumping kick. If he kills a white wolf enemy and grabs the flying orbs they leave behind, Zeus yells \" Power Up!\" and the centurion grows much more muscular, with more powerful punches and kicks. After collecting three orbs, he transforms into one of the following creatures:Level 1 - Wolf: The wolf's punches shoot out fireballs and his kick attack is replaced with a horizontal dash that quickly moves across the screen, killing any enemy in its path.Level 2 - Dragon: The dragon can fly across the screen. His punch is replaced with a lightning bolt that shoots out of the dragon's mouth. His kick is replaced with a radial lightning storm that kills any nearby enemies.Level 3 - Bear: The bear's punch attack is a short-ranged breath attack that turns enemies into stone, which can then be smashed. For his kick attack, the bear becomes an invincible spinning ball that flies straight up, or can be moved in an arc.Level 4 - Tiger: The tiger shoots a fireball from his fists when punching, just like the wolf. His kick is an up-and-down invincible dash.Level 5 - Golden Wolf: The golden wolf has the same moves as the wolf.[CR]Each level scrolls automatically to the right, with enemies advancing on the centurion throughout the level. The centurion can take several hits before he is killed. At the end of each level, the centurion faces off with the evil boss Neff, who transforms into a hideous monster capable of withstanding many attacks.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The second entry of the Might & Magic RPG series, Gates to Another World would continue its predecessor's open, non-linear world design. Players would continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet. As was popular at the time, many of its conventions appear based on concepts drawn up within the Dungeons and Dragons rule set by TSR.[CR]As with the first game, this game had also included a full color map of the world that the game was taking place on (in this case, Crom).[CR]Several enhancements were also made to the game over that of its predecessor:the number of spells increasedthe number of mini-quests were substantially increasedsecondary skills were now made available to characters, such as mountaineering (allowing the party to pass through mountain areas) in addition to several otherstwo new classes were added to the game: Barbarian and Ninja.[CR]The combat heavy nature of the series would continue with this entry although there were many puzzles and secrets to be discovered within the game. Characters from the first game can also be transferred into this one but with the following restrictions:Gold is set to 1000Food is set to 40Gems less than or equal to 100 remain the same while those numbering over 100 are reduced to 100Character levels less than 7 remain the same. Those 7 and above are reset to 7 if the first game was successfully completed, or to 6 if it was not.[CR]Special sub-quests for character classes were also included in the game to enhance their abilities.SNES Versions[CR]The Super Nintendo saw two separate adaptations of Might and Magic II:The European version was developed by Iguana Entertainment (later Acclaim Studios Austin) and published by Elite. This version was to be ported to the US by Sammy, but was canceled. This version is almost identical to the Genesis version.Japan saw a separate Super Famicom release named Might and Magic: Book II. It was developed by Starcraft and published by LOZC/G Amusements. This version never left Japan. It was rebuilt from scratch to be more like contemporary Japanese RPGs, such as Shin Megami Tensei and Dragon Quest.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As revealed at the end of the first Might and Magic, there is a considerable degree of sci-fi technology working behind the scenes of the world of VARN. The series' use of this would continue on through each one of the party-based RPG titles in the series and would usually be revealed close to the endgame.[CR]In Gates to Another World, the game picks up almost immediately following the events of Secret of the Inner Sanctrum. The party had uncovered a plot in the last game by an evil, otherworldly villain, Sheltem, who had escaped at the end by entering a gate to the world of Cron. It was also discovered that another being, Corak, had been pursuing him in Varn before he had escaped and now it falls to the characters to stop him. After many adventures and quests that take the party to the elemental planes and back again to the world of Cron, they finally track Sheltem down after assisting Corak.[CR]They confront him and his guards, but he manages to escape but not before telling them that CRON and all of its VARNs are heading into the sun. CRON is actually a massive ship and VARN is apparently one of its nacelles, a self contained world that is connected. Together, they have been set on a collision course and only the party can save both CRON and its VARNs.[CR]Sheltem has locked the controls and taunts the party with a recorded message revealing that he is the ruler of a world called Terra. He tells them that CRON and its VARNs were programmed by the Ancients to populate Terra, but he will not tolerate whom he believes to be inferiors polluting his race. However, in his arrogance, he has provided a cryptogram that must be deciphered with the clues given in order to change the course of CRON and save it and themselves from a fiery death.[CR]After solving the puzzle, it is revealed that what Sheltem had told them was partly the truth. CRON was created to populate Terra. But Sheltem is still missing and Corak has continued his search to stop his nemesis. The story continues in the third Might and Magic, the Isles of Terra.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The open ended gameplay was centered around a six person party with the world seen from a first person perspective utilizing rudimentary 3D graphics for the outdoor locations and indoor dungeons. Monsters along with certain other encounters were displayed as 2D pictures. As was the norm at the time for several RPG titles, movement was centered aroud a grid based scheme which meant 90 degree turns and square-based movement forward or back.[CR]The game was also considered quite detailed as well as difficult. Players were required to maintain a stock of food in order to be able to rest outside of an in to regain hit and spell points. Bashing open locked doors would often set off traps if they were not disarmed. Leveling was not automatic.[CR]Once a character had earned the requisite experience, it must be spent at a training ground in order to improve their statistics and abilities. Gems were often required to cast higher level spells and characters could also die from old age (natural or not), although the proper spells could alleviate its effects. Characters could also be afflicted with a number of debilitating conditions which often proved incredibly fatal to starting parties. Sex and alignment would also restrict certain characters from entering specific areas or in equipping certain items.[CR]Saves are handled at Inns within each town making it particularly dangerous to get caught far from their walls in dangerous territory. They are the only places where players may save the game.[CR]Towns and dungeons were all divided into 16 by 16 squares and the game used a  grid-based movement system with 90 degree turns.Races[CR]The game allows the player to select among five different races in building their characters. As with most other RPGs, certain races have slightly better statistics in certain areas and others, but the emphasis appears to be more on how resistant each one is against certain conditions such as falling prey to sleep spells or being more resistant to poison.[CR]The five races are:Human - Strong resistance to fear and some resistance to sleep spells. Average statistics make this race a good choice without any glaring weaknesses.Elf - They have a strong resistance to fear and are generally excellent at spellcastingDwarf - Some resistance to poison, stronger and hardier than the other races. They make excellent fighters but poor spellcasters.Gnome - Nimble and quick, they make excellent thieves and decent spellcasters.Half-Orc - They have a moderate resistance to sleep spells, are decently strong, and can make great fighters.Statistics[CR]The maximum value for any one statistic is 18, although this can change depending on several factors based on spells or the effects of certain items. However, if any statistic drops to 0, it will result in immediate death for that character.[CR]The basic statistics used in the game seem derived from the Dungeons and Dragons model of statistics, although carry different names so as to differentiate themselves. They are:Intellect - General knowledge. Important to sorcerers as it can affect spell points. Important to archers later on at higher levels as they begin learning sorcerer spells.Might - Raw strength. Important to any fighting class such as Knights and Paladins. Affects the damage a character can inflict in melee combat.Personality - A character's general degree of appeal to others. Particularly important to clerics as it affects their pool of spell points. Important to paladins when, at higher levels, they begin learning cleric spells.Endurance - Stamina. Affects how many hit points a character initially has to start with and will gain every time they level. Particularly important to fighters.Speed - Agility and general quickness affecting initiative. A faster character improves (increases) their Armor Class rating making them harder to hit.Accuracy - A character's ability to land hits during combat. This is particularly important to archers.Luck - Measures the general chances of a character succeeding when all else seems to have failed. Random and unpredictable.Classes[CR]Several classes are available for players to choose from in building their party of adventurers.Knight - These are considered the warriors of the game in being able to use any item or armor aside from those exclusively designed for another class or have an opposite alignment. They are able to attack more than once every round at higher levels.Paladin - While not quite as good as a Knight in combat, they are able to wield and equip as many items as they can with the same restrictions. At higher levels, they are also able to cast Clerical spells.Archer - These are the missile experts of the party and are able to use any weapon. Unlike the Paladin, they are also able to use missile weapons even in hand-to-hand combat. At higher levels, they are also able to cast Sorceror spells. They are restricted in the kind of armor that they can wear, however, such as chain mail or any lighter armor being the only types available for them and they cannot use a shield.Cleric - The traditional healer class, they can only wear light armor but they can also carry a shield. Weapons are restricted to a club, mace, flail, a staff, or a hammer. They cannot use ranged weapons such as bows. At higher levels, their healing abilities come in extremely valuable much further into the game. They are also the travel experts of Varn with spells that can teleport a party out from a dungeon, to a town for a quick rest, or enable them to walk on water to reach special areas.Sorceror - They can only wear padded armor and their choice of weapons are extremely limited and it almost goes without saying that they can't carry a shield. However, their spells more than make up this lack of physical protection and offensive ability with some of the most devastating attacks in the game.Robber - The traditional thief of the game, what they lack in offensive and defensive ability are made up with their talent for disarming traps and locks. They can fight as well as a cleric, but are far better at keeping the party safe from poison gas or fireballs erupting from chests.Barbarian - This character can use most weapons and starts with the greatest number of hit points out of any other class. A true tank character.Ninja - This character acts much like a fighting Robber, but they cannot carry a shield. They can use most one handed weapons but only swords specific to their class. Two handed weapons are limited to staves and the naginata. However, they do have the \"assassinate\" ability which is automatically attempted with their first attack. If successful, additional damage will result.Character Status[CR]In addition to their class and race, characters have a number of other statistics that players will need to keep track of during the game.Level - This is a measure of how experienced a character is. Characters start out at level 1 and can only gain levels once enough experience is earned and the necessary training is purchased.Spell Points - A measure of how many points are available to any one character for use with spells. Certain spells have higher point requirements than others.Hit Points - The number of hit points a character has remaining. At zero hit points, a character does not necessarily die. Instead, they fall unconscious. However, if they suffer anymore damage after reaching zero, death is the only result.Armor Class - The higher this number, the more resistant a character is to damage. Armor, spells, shields, and speed are among the factors that can help determine it.Age - Characters start at 18 years of age and grow older as the game continues on. As they become older, their skills begin to deteriorate and vital statistics will begin to drop. After around an age of 80, the character can actually die from resting overnight. Age can be delayed or reversed using spells or in discovering special locations.Experience Points - These are earned from defeating monsters and quests. These determine whether a character is ready to advance to the next level through training. The point requirements for reaching the next level usually double.Gems - This measures the number of gems that a character is carrying. Gems are valuable as they are consumed in order to cast many higher level spells.Gold - The coin of the realm earned in a variety of ways whether it is from monsters or in discovering long lost treasures.Food - Characters start with ten food units (up to a maximum of 40). One food unit represents a day's rations and is consumed when camping to replenish hit points and spell points during rest.Condition - A character's current status, whether they are asleep, poisoned, dead, etc..[CR]Each character also has their own backpack which can carry a maximum of six items.Alignment[CR]There are no absolutes in Might & Magic nor does this affect the story progression of the game. Instead, it largely determines certain restrictions such as whether a piece of equipment can be used or whether a particular character can enter specific areas.Locations[CR]Five towns are scattered throughout the land, each offering their own sets of challenges. The player was not implicitly told where to go, leaving it to their own inquisitive nature to discover where they should head off to next and who to speak to in order to find the next quest. In addition to the towns, many dungeons and secret locations are also scattered throughout the game.[CR]Towns share many of the same services.Shops - Where supplies, such as new armor and food, can be purchased.Temples - Where sick or injured characters can be healed.Training Grounds - Important for advancing character levels once enough experience has been earned.Inns - Where characters can safely rest and where saves can be made.[CR]Combat[CR]Generic encounters were randomly generated and would often give the player several choices. If monsters were surprised, the player had the option to ignore them or initiate combat. If the monsters surprised the player's party, combat would immediately begin. If both parties simply encountered each other, the player would also be able to decide what they should do next.[CR]Players could decide simply to attack the monsters, or they could try and bribe them which usually meant giving them gems or valuable food. Players could also attempt to surrender at which point they will be dropped off at a random, and more dangerous, location within the region with all of their food, gold, and gems confiscated. Failing at either of these actions will throw the party into combat.[CR]Massive battles consisting of 255 enemies were also a part of the gameplay.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Large gun shooting at you (Amiga)[CR]Apocalypse is a 2D helicopter shot'em'up with a multi directional parallax scrolling. Inspired by the movie Apocalypse Now the game takes up the issue of the Vietnam War. The player controls a heavily armed helicopter flying over enemy terrain(which looks in some places like a scene from the aforementioned film because of the cleverly used jungle settings), killing enemy soldiers with a vast array of weapons and destroying their bases, tanks, helicopters and artillery. But most importantly the player has to pick up POW's(prisoners of war) like in Choplifter! and ferry them safe to the home base.[CR]Development[CR]Apocalypse was the original idea of development team Strangeways, who begun the game development in 1990/91. Initially the game ought to be published by Image Works/Mirrorsoft in early 1992 but Image Works/Mirrorsoft went bankrupt in 1991 and the project was disbanded. Subsequently the game development was given in the capable hands of Miracle Games and was then published by Virgin in 1994.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Best buddy is a hostage (Amiga)[CR]Heavily armed rebel forces have invaded the insignificant island of Majipoor taking hundreds of prisoners, among them the players best buddy. Chosen from one of the elite the mission of the player is to destroy the enemy forces and to find and attempt to blow up the five key enemy bases situated in the dense jungle as well as the battleship which is docked somewhere on the island. But above all the player has to rescue as many prisoners of war(most of whom are scientists and military experts) as possible and of course the best buddy who is being held captive in a ruined temple in the heart of the jungle. Therefor a super charged gunship is at the players disposal and a medical team to take out wounded POWs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Start from the home base (Amiga)[CR]The gameplay starts in your home base to the far right-hand side of a section. Here a new helicopter appears and you can take the chopper up and out into the wild sky above. Every time you loose a chopper you get a new one and you start the gameplay again from the home base. At the beginning three choppers are at your disposal and an extra chopper is given if you complete a level or save all POW's of a section.[CR]The prisoners are dressed in white and most of them are locked away in the many huts scattered throughout the level, so first of all you need to free them using your chopper's machine guns to blow open the huts. Once the POWs are released they will start to run towards the nearest solid ground and if they are not wounded they will wave at you to catch your attention. On this solid ground you can land your chopper and airlift the prisoners back to the homebase. The prisoners are not rescued until the helicopter has deposit them at the home base and you can only carry a maximum of six healthy POW's in the chopper at once.POW's board the chopper (Amiga)[CR]However, some huts house enemy soldiers who are dressed in green. So if you blow open these huts they will run out and attack your helicopter with rocket launchers and high velocity machine guns, some of them will even attack the prisoners.[CR]Hostages being wounded by friendly or enemy fire and lying on the ground should't be ignored. You can save them by flying back to the home base and landing the chopper near the field hospital. Then a two men paramedic team with a stretcher will automatically board the chopper. Now you can fly back to the POW's and collect the injured ones, but only two wounded prisoners can be carried at once in the helicopter.[CR]The helicopter is armed with an unlimited supply of machine gun ammunition. Other special weapons like firebombs, rockets, homing missiles and mines are limited in supply. The amount of the special weapons is displayed on the right side of the screen by four icons with a number below the icons. Additional amount of special weapons is dropped in on parachutes which can be collected by flying into them.[CR]",

Upgrades are a forward-facing three-way, a vertical two-way, or the addition of a single backwards shot (only one of the three at time). Also available are pods that attach to the ship and fire a forwards laser, and, only in the final level, self-homing missiles.[CR]The levels not only feature many enemy formations, but also environmental hazards, like drops of acid or falling stalactites. On one occasion, the scrolling speeds up, making the level a hazard course. Each stage ends with the customary end boss.",

In Japan it was released as PC Genjin (PC\u539f\u4eba?) in 1989, a play on the Japanese name for the system, 'PC Engine'. The game was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in the U.S. in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. The game was later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Amiga, arcade systems under different titles (FC Genjin, GB Genjin and BC Genjin). It is also available through Nintendo's Virtual Console service, on the PlayStation Store and there is a version for mobile phones in Japan.[CR]Bonk attacks enemies by \"bonking\" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.[CR]Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power and a large one takes him to stage three. Eating a small meat while in stage two will also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third stage effect wears off he returns to the second state and remains there for a while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.[CR]Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.[CR]Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \"smiley\" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.",

An evil and powerful archmage named Lagoth Zanta and his hordes threaten the cities of the Realm and it is his hope that the player's party will be able to stop him. But the only relic that could unite the cities and give the party the power to stop his invasion has been shattered. The fabled Destiny Wand that has maintained seven centuries of peace is gone and with it, the hopes of an entire land. However, Saradon has managed to discover where the pieces of the wand lay hidden. Broken into seven pieces and hidden within seven deadly Snares of Death throughout the land, the party is challenged to reforge the Destiny Wand, call upon the powers of the Destiny Knight, and ultimately confront and destroy Lagoth Zanta. The players begin their quest in Tangramayne, the capital city of the Realm, a land where six other cities lay scattered across a large, open wilderness. From there, they must gather the clues needed to unravel the locations of several other dungeons, each containing a vital clue to lead the party on to their next destination. There are no cinematics within the game to help tell the story, although there are occasionally small events in the form of text that help describe some of the key elements within the game. The Snares of Death, in particular, had \"magic mouths\" which would present their challenges in the form of riddles filled with the clues needed to survive each one. The hint guide, bearing the title \"Dream Quest\", for the game was particularly noteworthy for its narrative approach in guiding the player. Taking on the form of a fictional story centered around a party of adventurers that sought the services of an old wizard and his young apprentice, they would embark on a \"vision quest\" into the possibilities offered to them of a quest for a certain \"golden fleece\" or that of the Destiny Wand. The young apprentice would invisibly accompany the party into the vision and the journal that he would carry would magically write itself with their experiences and his own thoughts creating the story journal. The hint guide was illustrated with artistic sketches alongside maps and would describe the ending of the game as well as that of its own story.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Players must assemble a band of adventurers and track down the seven pieces of the Destiny Wand to confront and defeat the evil Archmage, Lagoth Zanta. Once all seven pieces are recovered, the scepter must be reforged, unifying the Realm and winning the game.[CR]The Destiny Knight is the sequel to the first Bard's Tale as initially released on personal computers such as the Apple and the Commodore 64. According to the box text, it features various improvements over the original system such as:50% larger than the first Bard's Tale Six new cities and an overland wilderness The ability to summon and name monsters to become a permanent part of your party Ranged combat A bank and a casino  Six cities expanded the scope of the adventure acting more as locations for specific dungeons than as living, breathing, politically driven entities. They are:Tangramayne Ephesus Philippi Colosse Corinth Thessalonica  The game continues to use the   grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. Within the persistent interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed below and a text box in the upper right quadrant of the screen displaying messages and encounter options. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes which would now use ranged attacks.Destiny Knight was also notable for its use of an open wilderness between the six cities of the Realm, the land in which the story takes place. Predating similar efforts such as that found in Bethesda's   Elder Scrolls series by several years, the wilderness contained several dungeon areas that were necessary to complete for the main quest.   Puzzles were also given a high priority this time around in the form of Death Snares, trap rooms in which the pieces of the Destiny Wand were hidden and which could kill the entire party if they failed to solve it within a certain time limit. A rough map was included with the game showing the locations for several places but leaving the mapping of each interior to the graph paper tablets RPGers at the time used often to keep from getting lost.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Beginners were given a break in the form of a pre-made party that they can use to jump right into the game with. The adventure starts at the Adventurer's Guild, a location in each city where the player can save the game, form their party, and save their characters to disk just in case the worst happens. Across from the initial Guild is a starter dungeon which should get them up to speed on both the game systems as well as toughen their characters up for the trials ahead. The manual suggests that the characters should reach level 14 before venturing anywhere else in the game.As with most RPGs of this type, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. A party is limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may occasionally join the party. This was particularly important within one of the dungeons of the game as a particular NPC would be required to help solve a puzzle.Time also plays a factor in the game as it cycles from day to night, night bringing out the more dangerous creatures that roam the Wilderness.Veterans can transfer character data from the first   Bard's Tale,   Wizardry I, or   Ultima III if they want to start off with a solid group of characters, although items and the like are not brought over.The game did not make use of an outside license for its statistics and rules, although it shared many similarities with TSR's Dungeons and Dragons ruleset with significant differences that set it apart. In particular, mages were not required to maintain a memorized \"pool\" of spells as in D&D and instead cast their spells by using spell points which represented their inner strength and power. The types of spells that any one mage could cast were also dramatically different, although a character's   general statistics would reflect some of the traditional mentality that TSR's influence over RPGs at the time had made an impression with. RacesSeven races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world.  Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses. Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialities are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters.   Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong if not very smart, dwarves excel as solid warriors in the Bard's Tale.   Hobbit: Small, nimble, and wise, they make ideal rogues. Half-Elf: Thanks to their mixed ancestry, they are able performers as fighters although not as good as spellcasting as their elven peers. Half-Orc: Part human, all ugly, they also make decent fighters but offer no other significant bonus other than variety to the party.   Gnome: Resemble dwarves but are better at using magic. If you are looking for a little toughness to go with your mages, this is one race to consider.   Classes   Picking a class for a new character is one of the important decisions that the player will make in a game like this one. Using a combination of different skills is the key to building a solid party that will be able to return home and sing of their adventures. On the party screen, characters are represented by their name and abbreviated class for quick reference along with all of the requisite attributes such as   hit points (HIT PTS) and  Spell Points (SPL PTS) in  columns and lines.Warrior (WA): The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. For every four levels of experience after the first, they gain the ability to dish out an extra attack. Paladin (PA): These are fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be. They can perform multiple attacks at higher levels, use most any weapon including certain ones that other fighters can't, and have a greater resistance to evil magic. Unlike in other systems, such as Dungeons & Dragons, the player does not have to pick a deity for them to worship nor can they cast any spells of their own at higher levels. They are a pure fighter with bonuses making them a staple of any party in the Bard's Tale.  Rogue (RO): The professional thieves of the Realm, what they lack in fighting ability they make up for being sneaky. They can hide in shadows (thus avoiding damage from enemies) and are able to search for and disarm traps of which there are many especially within the Death Snares. Bard (BA): They are warriors that have learned to sing. Although they don't have multiple attacks at higher levels as a true warrior class would, their songs are capable of spell-like effects that can aid the party in a variety of ways. Unlike spell casters, the Bard's songs bestow important buffs on the entire party for the duration of the song. Their songs can often work even within anti-magic zones. If combat interrupts a song, it will pick up again when it is completed even if another song is performed during the fight. An instrument is needed for a Bard in addition to whatever weapons they have. The Bard can play as many tunes in his repertoire until his throat dries, thus necessitating a visit to the local tavern for a tankard of fine ale to get them going again. Hunter (HU): They can use most weapons and have the ability to often instantly kill an opponent by striking a vital nerve center, an ability that improves as they gain experience levels. Monk (MO): They use traditional fighting weapons and gain more effectiveness at fighting with their bare hands at higher levels becoming devastating warriors.   Magic users were divided into several classes with a few of these requiring a pre-requisite in ability. Mages had to meet those requirements before graduating to the higher classes which are initially unavailable to a starting party. It was also a one-way class change. Once a character chose to be a particular class, they were locked into that decision and could not learn any spells that they chose not to.Conjurers (CO): One of the first classes that a magic user can start with. They can create fireballs and compasses to help defend and guide the party and have a smattering of healing spells for support. Magicians (MA): This is another class that new magic users can start off with. They can enchant items with temporary effects and user their spells as buffs to aid the party in combat, such as improving their armor class. Sorcerors (SO): They can create illusions including illusory party members and aid in the perception of the world around the party with spells enabling them to see in the dark. Most of their offensive spells tend to be mind based. These are not initially available to new characters until they have earned three levels of experience as either a Conjurer or a Magician. In other words, if a Magician character class has leveled far enough to cast third level spells, they can become a Sorceror. Wizard (WI): As with the Sorceror, a mage must learn at least three spell levels of their starting class before they can become a Wizard. Wizards are the summoning specialists and have the ability to raise the dead making them extremely valuable. Archmage (AR): This class can only be attained after learning three spell levels from each of the preceding classes, although the manual suggests that a true Archmage is one that has learned all seven from each. Archmages have the smallest number of spells to choose from, but make up for this thanks to the sheer power vested within each one. They are able to heal an entire party, resurrect multiple characters at once, crush enemies with incredible magic, and summon powerful allies. Lagoth Zanta, the main antagonist of the game, is an Archmage.   Locations   There are a variety of locales in the game that provide a number of important services, listed both in the manual and within the game itself:The Sage: He lives out in the Wilderness and is a valuable treasure trove of knowledge. The player must make use of his services in order to ask for the location of certain places to which he will point the way, but only for a price. As the player journeys through the world, they will encounter new clues that they must barter with the Sage on in order to continue the quest, entering certain key words into the parser that comes up when conversing with him. Temples: Provide valuable healing services for when your mages aren't powerful enough yet to do the healing themselves. They are also the only places tha can cure withered characters (old age) or ones that have been turned to stone. The manual says that the resurrected character may need to sell their soul in order to come back to life, but in terms of the game, that doesn't happen. Roscoe's Energy Emporium: Roscoe is a mage who had opened a chain of energy emporiums in order to cash in on the sorcereal energy crisis of '27. Even after it had passed, Roscoe's emporiums continue to provide a valuable service by recharging the spell points of wealthy mages. His services don't come cheap, but if you can't wait for spell points to regenerate, his emporiums are worth a visit. Unmarked Buildings: While exploring the cities of the Realm, the player can barge into unmarked buildings. This also tends to trigger a combat encounter. For the most part, there is nothing to see in any of these structures except the exit, although the party will be running into several of these in searching for hidden dungeon entrances leading to the next part of their quest. Adventurer's Guild: This is the \"union hall\" where unemployed characters hang around hoping to join the next expedition. This is where it all begins and one is located in each of the major cities. Saves are handled here along with party formation. You can't save while in the middle of a dungeon or out in the wilderness, so knowing where these are located in each city is an important part of the game. You can also remove characters from your party and keep them here in case you need to free up an extra slot for a special character. One or two puzzles require the use of a special character in the party. Garth's Equipment Shoppe: Garth retired from adventuring and his deeds are sung far and wide. He now sells his knowledge of weapons and artifacts as a part of a string of stores that lie spread across the Realm, providing basic equipment to everyone as well as a few particularly rare and powerful pieces for those with enough gold. He can also identify unknown items thanks to his extensive knowledge, for a price, Selling rare items to Garth will not appear in his shoppe, though, so be careful about getting rid of items that you might need later on. Fortunately, quest items cannot be sold. Garth is everywhere and in every shoppe, so you don't need to worry about trekking back to one particular branch. Review Board: Shadowy figures representing all of the classes in the game sit in judgement over characters that come to them for advancement. If you have enough experience, you'll get your level. Mages learn their spells in batches, so once they gain a spell level, all spells in that tier are learned. These are not marked on any map and must be discovered. The good news is that they typically have a unique facade so turning and facing a building is all that is needed to know what it is. Casinos: Players can gamble their ill gotten gold in these halls for the chance to score big, although the dealers have been known to cheat if stiffed for a tip. Bedder's Bank for the Bold: An old-half elf who had reputedly sold his own mother to a band of lonely orcs to finance his first branch, Bedder will deposit your gold for safekeeping in case anything...tragic...happens to the party. There's no interest and withdrawals must be made for the entire amount, but gold can be added at any time in any amount. Good for making sure that there's a nest egg out there available for any set of characters that you might create.  Taverns: The rest stop for the Bard in your party and a place to hear pieces of gossip.  There were also the seven major dungeons that could only be found with the help of the Sage scattered throughout the Realm. Each dungeon would consist of several levels and sometimes possessed a   boss fight or two in addition to the Death Snare within. They would take the form of tombs, crypts, castles, and even a tower. [CR]Combat[CR]   Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters and is required to earn those valuable   experience points and grow the party into an unstoppable force capable of facing the dangers ahead. A list of foes (broken down by the number in each group) is given at the start of the fight. The maximum number of foes is up to four groups of monsters. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks such as breath weapons or spells to deal damage, or summon monsters to block your advance. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.Party arrangement is also important. The first four characters can be physically attacked and can dish out the same leaving the last three to resort to ranged attacks.Combat actions are triggered by hitting the appropriate key when a character's turn comes up, allowing the player to time certain attacks for when it is a particular character's turn to act in that round. They are:(A)ttack foes: Orders a character to physically assault the enemy. This applies to the first four chraacters only. (P)arty attack: Orders a character to beat down a fellow party member or special character. Sometimes necessary. (D)efend: This reduces the damage a character may recieve in case you suspect that they can do nothing else at the moment. (U)se an Item: Allows a character to use a ranged weapon or a magic item. (B)ard Song: Tells the Bard to play a short tune during the fight. Typically lasts for only one round. (C)ast a Spell: This is where mages get to work their magic. When selected, the player must enter the four digit code for the spell in question and specify a target if required. (H)ide in Shadows: Tells a rogue to hide in the shadows, avoiding damage during that turn since the enemy can't see them. They can also avoid spell effects this way.  All of the results are calculated in the background. Certain statistics, such as dexterity and luck, determine who will strike first in a fight. The character in the first party slot is designated as the leader and the chance of running into danger is heavily determined by the statistics of that leader.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Bard's Tale III is the last chapter of the   Bard's Tale series. As with the   Bard's Tale I and   II, players must assemble a group of adventurers together in order to discover and destroy the source of Skara Brae's destruction. The box text describes the player traveling across seven dimensions, 84 dungeon levels, and fight over 500 kinds of monsters some of whom might even join the player, all in a bid to stop the Mad God.[CR]Additional improvements were made to the gameplay system on top of those made with the   Bard's Tale II. As noted on the fly cover of the box, the improvements include:Enhanced   save game feature allowing the player to save anywhere   Automap feature Improved graphics New  spellcasters Ability to import   Bard's Tale I and   II characters.  Traveling to different dimensions has significantly increased the vast scope of the Bard's Tale game and each dimension has its own quirks that the player must work through in order to solve the puzzles within each and succeed in their quest. The original packaging of the game had clues within its fly cover describing each dimension and hinting at the possible solutions within. The party needed to visit each dimension in order to collect special items and magic that would be needed to face off against the Mad God Tarjan.The game continues to use  the   grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. The interface continues to be a persistent feature in the GUI with a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displaying the world with the party listed below. A text box in the upper right quadrant of the screen displaying messages and encounter options. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing   experience.   The Bard's Tale III also employed a rudimentary form of   copy protection by using an included code wheel. When teleporting to a dimension, the player would be challenged to enter a response requiring the use of the wheel. If you had lost your wheel at the time, it would render the game unplayable since you needed to use it in order to answer the challenge correctly. When Interplay had released their Ultimate RPG Archive collection, they had forgotten to remove the   copy protection schemes from all three games (  Bard's Tale I and   II used the included maps as a part of their protection). They made both the maps and a cracked executable for Thief of Fate available from their site in order to rectify the misstep.Time is also a factor in the game with day and night cycles influencing the kind of monsters that may be roaming around in the Wilderness. Mages can regenerate spells by simply waiting under the sun during the day.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Title Screen  In the last chapter of the   Bard's Tale trilogy, the party receives a letter from a dying mage who has risked his life to warn them of the arrival of Tarjan, the Mad God.Skara Brae, the city that was saved from destruction at Mangar's hand in the first   Bard's Tale, has been destroyed on the day celebrating the death of Mangar. Tarjan invaded the city with terrifying monsters and incredible magic, laying waste everything within its walls and leaving few alive to warn the living. The mage's message had managed to make it to the adventurers who, led by the player, must now journey across the very dimensions themselves to other worlds and cities in an effort to gather together the magic and the means by which they can seek vengeance against the Mad God before he extends his dominion across the land.The title refers to using a thief in the final battle to assassinate the Mad God while the rest of the party holds off the horde of deadly monsters that Tarjan will send against them, although creative players with sufficiently powerful characters have discovered that one isn't absolutely needed in order to win the game. Much of the quest is focused on the so-called \"Thief of Fate\" concept, however, with various hints and suggestions woven into its fiction.At the conclusion of the final battle, the ruin that had been afflicted on Skara Brae is lifted and the party become gods themselves as a final reward, their constellations set into the night sky above.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   The brutal nature of the monsters and challenges in Thief of Fate made the game extremely hard for newcomers to get a grasp on, even with the included pre-made party. Importing characters from the previous games was included as an option. Grinding the beginner's dungeon was almost a requirement.The game significantly altered the landscape of Skara Brae and the Bard's Tale world by reflecting the devastation wrought by Tarjan and his minions across the land. Where adventurers in the earlier games would start their quest from the Adventurer's Guild, it has been replaced by the Refugee Camp which is all that is left of the people of Skara Brae. There is a starter dungeon in the ruins of Skara Brae which should get new players up to speed on both the game systems as well as toughen their characters up for the trials ahead.Despite the dramatic changes made to the setting and the quest, the core mechanics remain unchanged with little to differentiate the system from its previous iterations. As before, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. A party continued to be limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may join the party.Characters could be transferred from the following games:  Bard's Tale I and   II   Ultima III and   IV   Wizardry I,   II,   III  As noted earlier, it is suggested that players do so in order to survive the initial encounters, or grind the first dungeon until they are able to hold their own in combat. It will only get worse from there. However, there are a variety of exploits that can dramatically level parties up with   experience early on in the game. RacesSeven races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world. Players can now select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait. As with the previous titles, the races did not undergo any significant changes and had been presented in the same way as before.  Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.  Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialities are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters.   Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong if not very smart, dwarves excel as solid warriors in the Bard's Tale.   Hobbit: Small, nimble, and wise, they make ideal rogues. Half-Elf: Thanks to their mixed ancestry, they are able performers as fighters although not as good as spellcasting as their elven peers. Half-Orc: Part human, all ugly, they also make decent fighters but offer no other significant bonus other than variety to the party.   Gnome: Resemble dwarves but are better at using magic. If you are looking for a little toughness to go with your mages, this is one race to consider.   Classes Paladin, Female  The manual suggest using a combination of different skills to build a solid party that will be able to return home and sing of their adventures. On the party screen, characters are represented by their name and abbreviated class for quick reference along with all of the requisite attributes such as   hit points (Hits) and Spell Points (SpPt) in  columns and lines alongside other statistics. The class column has been dropped from the screen interface and abbreviations for the classes have also been removed as another change.None of the classes that make a return in the game have undergone any changes aside from the Rogue and the additions made to the magic users expanding the number of classes available to them.Warrior: They can use nearly every weapon that they find. For every four levels of experience after the first, they gain the ability to dish out an extra attack. Paladin: They can perform multiple attacks at higher levels, use most any weapon including certain ones that other fighters can't, and have a greater resistance to evil magic. Unlike in other systems, such as Dungeons & Dragons, the player does not have to pick a deity for them to worship nor can they cast any spells of their own at higher levels. They are a pure fighter with bonuses making them a staple of any party in the Bard's Tale.  Rogue: These have been significantly improved since the last game, likely owing to the fact that the game is subtitled as \"the Thief of Fate\" which points out just how important they are now. The professional thieves of the Realm, what they lack in fighting ability they make up for being sneaky. They can hide in shadows (thus avoiding damage from enemies) and are able to search for and disarm traps. However, they also have the ability to identify mysterious items and can backstab and critically hit, often killing, powerful monsters by hiding in the shadows and getting close to their prey. They're extremely useful for sneaking behind enemy lines and killing that annoying mage that happens to be ninety feet away.   Bard: They are warriors that have learned to sing. Although they don't have multiple attacks at higher levels as a true warrior class would, their songs are capable of spell-like effects that can aid the party in a variety of ways. Unlike spell casters, the Bard's songs bestow important buffs on the entire party for the duration of the song. Their songs can often work even within anti-magic zones. If combat interrupts a song, it will pick up again when it is completed even if another song is performed during the fight. An instrument is needed for a Bard in addition to whatever weapons they have. The Bard can play as many tunes in his repertoire until his throat dries, thus necessitating a visit to the Scrapwood Tavern for a tankard of fine ale to get them going again.  Hunter: They can use most weapons and have the ability to often instantly kill an opponent by striking a vital nerve center, an ability that improves as they gain experience levels.  Monk: They use traditional fighting weapons and gain more effectiveness at fighting with their bare hands at higher levels becoming devastating juggernauts of punishing annihilation.  Magic users were divided into several classes with a few of these requiring a pre-requisite in ability. As before, magic users that meet certain conditions can graduate to more powerful classes. Such a change is still a one-way street forcing players to carefully consider their options.Conjurers: One of the first classes that a magic user can start with. They can create fireballs and compasses to help defend and guide the party and have a smattering of healing spells for support. Magicians: This is another class that new magic users can start off with. They can enchant items with temporary effects and user their spells as buffs to aid the party in combat, such as improving their armor class.  Sorcerers: They can create illusions including illusory party members and aid in the perception of the world around the party with spells enabling them to see in the dark. Most of their offensive spells tend to be mind based. These are not initially available to new characters until they have earned three levels of experience as either a Conjurer or a Magician. In other words, if a Magician character class has leveled far enough to cast third level spells, they can become a Sorceror.  Wizard: As with the Sorceror, a mage must learn at least three spell levels of their starting class before they can become a Wizard. Wizards are the summoning specialists and have the ability to raise the dead making them extremely valuable.  Archmage: Unlike in the   Bard's Tale II, to be an Archmage, a character must have mastered all of the spells of any three magic classes (Magician, Conjurer, Wizard) as opposed to simply learning three   levels from each one. Archmages have the smallest number of spells to choose from, but make up for this thanks to the sheer power vested within each. They are able to heal an entire party, resurrect multiple characters at once, crush enemies with incredible magic, and summon powerful allies. Geomancer: These are warriors that have chosen to become spellcasters, however the class cannot be initially chosen. Instead, a special location must first be found where the rite of passage can be performed. The class can still use all of the armor and weapons from before, but there are sacrifices. Warriors lose their multiple attacks, hunters lose their critical hit ability, and monks lose their AC (armor class) and attack bonuses. They do, however, have an excellent selection of hard hitting spells and thanks to being able to wear any armor and wield as many weapons as did before, aren't completely defenseless as the other, dedicated, mage classes. Their repertoire of offensive magic is also impressive for the high damage values that it can blast enemies with. Chronomancer: These are not initially available to players until one of their mage characters have mastered all of the spells of any of the three mage classes in the same way as an Archmage. However, upon becoming a Chronomancer, the character loses all of their previously learned magic in order to focus all of their energies into casting the portals needed to take the party across the dimensions. A party has to have one in order to advance in the game. The good news is that Chronomancers also have a number of highly damaging offensive spells.   Locations Inside Scrapwood Tavern  The Mad God and his minions have ravaged the lands and city of Skara Brae, leaving nothing but a ruined wilderness. Many of the previous locations that players may remember from the first two games are no longer around, replaced by the survivors:The Wilderness: Outside of the Refugee Camp and surrounding Skara Brae is the wilderness where a temple can be found along with the special locations where a Chronomancer can work their spells to teleport the player to other dimensions. Shrine: Provides the services that a temple from the previous games had in terms of healing and resurrecting the dead until your mages are experienced enough. It's located out in the Wilderness. Refugee Camp: The Adventurer's Guild is no more, having been destroyed along with the city, but the Camp performs all of the same functions without the nice tables, vermin free bedding, and a roof over your head while sharing your tales of adventure. Character can be created here, parties reorganized, saved, and new members added in when needed. There is no longer an equipment shop such as Garth's Equipment Shoppe anymore. Players will be forced to either find the equipment they need during their battles or purchase and sell items by finding merchants elsewhere. Review Board: Nearly all of the members were killed when Skara Brae fell, but the Old Man still sits on the Board in the city, reviewing those that have earned the right to advance. Scrapwood Tavern: Located in the Wilderness, just a short way from the Refugee Camp. The Bard can wet their whistle here before heading back out and the barkeep may have something new to gossip about.  The casino and bank from the   Bard's Tale II are no longer around.The dimensions that the player will travel to each have their own unique problems and quests. No two are alike and the player will need to travel to follow a string of clues in linear fashion as they proceed from one world to the next. They can always revisit their home dimension and previous worlds. The fly cover box provided clues and insight into each dimension as listed below, quoted from the material:Arboria: \"Valarian's Bow and the Arrows of Life are only two of the prizes you'll gain from the strife.\" This is the first dimension that players will journey to, offering a traditional fantasy world with a small town and a few dungeons to explore. Gelidia: \"The ice storm whips up a terrible chill, so hurry to Lanatir or be frozen still.\" Lucencia: \"Red monsters are trouble, but the blue ones are double.\" Kinestia: \"Spells will cost you dearly to cast, so find where Umbrech is hidden real fast.\"  Tenebrosia: \"Blackscar is where you'll want to go, before the shadows deepen your woe.\"  Tarmitia: \"Travel in time and between the wars, survive the battles and the Strifespear is yours.\"This is a dimension filled with pure combat from a variety of eras. Players will face off against everything from Mongol Raiders to SS Officers. At the completion of this world, Tarjan finally acts and kills the Old Man at the Review Board, so be sure that you have earned all of the levels that you may need before completing your quest here.  Malefia: \"Evil evil, from the cracks they tee, when will you wake from this nightmarish dream?\"This is it, the final dimension and the trickiest one out of all of them. The most brutal encounters in the game are here along with the Mad God himself. Here is where a thief can change the fate of a world.   [CR]Combat[CR] Treasure!  The fighting system of the series did not undergo any significant changes throughout its run and the last title retains all of the basic mechanics with only cosmetic changes to the visuals. Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random encounters wherein   experience, items, and gold are earned. A list of foes (broken down by the number in each group) is given at the start of the fight. The maximum number of foes is up to four groups of monsters. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks such as breath weapons or spells to deal damage, or summon monsters to block your advance. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.Party arrangement is also important. The first four characters can be physically attacked and can dish out the same leaving the last three to resort to ranged attacks.Combat actions are triggered by hitting the appropriate key when a character's turn comes up, allowing the player to time certain attacks for when it is a particular character's turn to act in that round. They are:(A)ttack foes: Orders a character to physically assault the enemy. This applies to the first four characters only. (P)arty attack: Orders a character to beat down a fellow party member or special character. Sometimes necessary. (D)efend: This reduces the damage a character may recieve in case you suspect that they can do nothing else at the moment. (U)se an Item: Allows a character to use a ranged weapon or a magic item. (B)ard Song: Tells the Bard to play a short tune during the fight. Typically lasts for only one round. (C)ast a Spell: This is where mages get to work their magic. When selected, the player must enter the four digit code for the spell in question and specify a target if required. (H)ide in Shadows: Tells a rogue to hide in the shadows, avoiding damage during that turn since the enemy can't see them. They can also avoid spell effects this way.  All of the results are calculated in the background. Certain statistics, such as dexterity and luck, determine who will strike first in a fight. The character in the first party slot is designated as the leader and the chance of running into danger is heavily determined by the  statistics of that leader.[CR]",

It is considered very rare since the registered version was only sold in the Australian territory.[CR]The story behind Baron Baldric: A Grave Overture takes place under Castle Pedabouch. You have to search for the family treasures in the tomb: it was told that, centuries before, Baron Baldric's ancestor, Baron Lazarus Pedabouche studied an evil Wolf-Magic and turned into a cruel tyrant: fortunately, when he seized Rosie, a local milk-maid, he was stoned to death by his own subjects. Rosie died too, and was doomed to haunt the whole castle until the ancient baron was slain.[CR]A Grave Overture reminds of classics like Impossible Mission 2 and the earlier Montezuma's Revenge because of many elements bringing the game far from the action genre. You have to find flints to light lamps when they go out, and regularly eat food to survive the maze.",

The arcade version had 3 mounted guns, allowing for three player simultaneous action. The home conversions support a maximum of two players.[CR]The player must shoot everything that moves, while conserving  ammo and grenades. Your machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, and you can use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets or just to clear the screen of zombie scum. [CR]Grenades you can pick up along the way include standard grenades, electro grenade and napalm bombs. Onscreen zombies explode in a splatter of blood and gore.[CR]The screen scrolls in a variety of directions, sometimes in pseudo 3D. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, throwing Molotov cocktails and knifes and other will simply jump right at you. You can shoot knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.[CR]The bosses include a zombie punk who mutates into a dog, a freaky blob-snake-head that comes at the screen and a jeep which comes to life.",

The player takes the role of a young man, who is called the Beastlord because he can interact with animals, and has to explore three levels with the goal to free the guardians. The levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there are many branches to map out.The interaction with enemies offers no surprises: the player can perform a variety of combat moves in order to beat them up. Disposed enemies leave items behind, mostly food and money. However, the game requires the player to solve various puzzles in order to progress and to talk to the animals and humans found in the levels. Usually certain items need be found and used at the correct spot respectively traded for another item. Those non-fighting actions are initiated through a pop-up menu. The game also features basic magic, a day/night cycle (some actions are only possible at a certain time) and hunger which causes the need for constant fighting in order to keep the steadily decreasing energy bar up.",

She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and all their master tapes are destroyed. Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. He sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the help of his children.[CR]You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.[CR]If fighting is not enough, you must collect Charisma Stars to maintain your charisma that you will need to complete a level. [CR]There are also Life Stars which have the ability to give you another life, but to get these, you must sneak up on them or the will move out of your reach. To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas. Just try jumping on them. Sometimes to reach the top of a level, clouds may have to be used. Some are more solid than the others. Mushroom Seeds can be used to grow your own platform to access other platforms. You may come across machinery that activate lifts or send a jet of steam into the air.

Game mechanics are Wolfenstein 3D-influenced, and the graphics smooth and, surprisingly, fast, though they do not vary much except in colour tint.

                "title_clean": "Beneath a Steel Sky",
                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Beneath a Steel Sky is a 1994 point-and-click adventure game developed by Revolution Software Ltd. and originally published by Virgin Interactive. It was a creative collaboration between Charles Cecil, a game designer who would later create the concept for the Broken Sword franchise, and Dave Gibbons, an acclaimed comic book artist best known for illustrating the seminal superhero graphic novel Watchmen. The game stars protagonist Robert Foster, a tribal survivalist and technological prodigy who was orphaned and raised in a post-World-War-III Australian Outback, and his sarcastic robotic companion Joey. The setting and concepts of Beneath a Steel Sky address concerns about heavily-urbanized society and the threats posed by humanity's over-reliance on technology, consumer capitalism, and government surveillance. Beneath a Steel Sky's introductory sequence was packed-in as a comic book with certain editions of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a traditional  point-and-click adventure game, Beneath a Steel Sky's gameplay is similar to LucasArts adventure games of the era, primarily consisting of navigating dialogue trees and solving inventory-based puzzles. However, there are certain sequences in which the protagonist may be killed or receive a \"bad\" ending, requiring players to load a saved game in order to continue. Players choose Foster's responses during conversations and may question NPCs about events related to the story and its characters, as well as Foster's own personal background. Foster's robotic pal Joey is also present throughout most of the game, providing color commentary and playing a key role in solving certain puzzles. The CD-ROM release of Beneath a Steel Sky includes full voice acting for all character dialogue.[CR]The game's world is largely non-linear and players must explore their surroundings thoroughly for key items and clues about their next destination. At one point in the game, the player gains access to an abstract cyberspace world that must be navigated to make progress.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Beneath a Steel Sky is set in a future dystopic version of Australia where players assume the role of a plucky tribal-turned-fugitive named Robert Foster. As a young boy, Robert was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash that killed his mother and left him orphaned before being discovered by a tribe of scavengers, who raised Robert as one of their own in \"The Gap\", an area comprised of the modern-day Australian Outback. His adoptive tribe only knew Robert by his first name, but they eventually gave him his new surname of \"Foster\" in reference to an empty can of Foster's Lager found near his transport's crash site. Foster learns basic survival skills under the tribe's guidance and demonstrates an incredible affinity for engineering and electronics, which he uses to construct \"Joey\": an AI companion stored on a small circuit board that can be swapped between robotic shells.[CR]One night, the tribe elder prophecies about a terrible evil emanating from deep beneath Union City and headed for their tribe's makeshift village. A heavily-armed helicopter suddenly arrives in The Gap and summarily attacks Foster's defenseless tribe before landing to deploy a team of soldiers from Union City. Joey's chassis is also severely damaged during the attack, forcing Foster to eject and store Joey's main circuit board for safekeeping. The soldiers begin searching specifically for Foster, claiming to want to return him to his original home. When the team's Commander Reich threatens to massacre Robert's entire village unless he is found, Foster turns himself over to Reich's custody; however, as they depart The Gap, Reich's team detonates a large explosive that obliterates the scavengers' settlement as Foster watches in horror. Restrained by Reich's guards, a grieving Foster can only bide his time and wait for an opportunity to escape and exact his vengeance.[CR]While en route to Union City central command, the helicopter's pilot loses navigational control, forcing the transport down somewhere among the cityscape's dizzying skyscrapers. After crash-landing onto an elevated city street, Foster makes a narrow escape from Reich's soldiers and finds a new robotic chassis for Joey, but Reich soon corners Foster near an industrial furnace and calls him by the unfamiliar name \"Overmann\". When Reich threatens Foster with a pistol, he is instantly disarmed and killed by a security turret embedded in a nearby wall.[CR]Using Reich's ID card, Foster begins investigating the reasons behind his capture and the connection to the helicopter crash that left him an orphan. He quickly finds Union City to be an urban dystopia; the sprawling metropolis is completely controlled by a centralized computer known as LINC and a legion of secret police, as well as a nightmarish justice system mired in bureaucracy. Although offering modern comforts such as advanced medical technology and automated labor, Union City's government does not recognize basic human rights for many of its citizens, with harsh distinctions between the upper and lower classes. Citizens that have been stripped of any privileges due to inappropriate behavior are known as \"D-LINCs\", and are subject to terrible working conditions and restricted movement inside the city with little hope for a reprieve.[CR]Foster also meets Anita, a D-LINC citizen and resistance sympathizer working in a pipe factory. She informs Foster of a plan devised by agents of nearby Hobart City to disable the rampant growth of LINC's biological components with a virus. Unfortunately, Anita is killed before she can deploy the virus; Foster later discovers a message file left for him by Anita, imploring him to complete her mission. Foster eventually obtains the virus in LINC-SPACE and, after discovering a large complex of tunnels deep beneath the city, infects LINC's systems with the virus. Joey also gains an advanced android shell inside the complex, remarking on how vulnerable he feels in his new humanoid form. However, before Foster can reach LINC's core control interface, he is confronted by a pair of deadly security androids which he barely manages to dispatch with Joey's assistance.[CR]Foster and Joey finally reach LINC's core only to discover Foster's father, Dr. Richard Overmann, physically integrated into the computer by a mass of organic tendrils. Richard explains how he became the project leader responsible for developing and constructing LINC twenty years ago, willingly fusing himself with the system in order to achieve the perfect union of man and machine. However, LINC soon grew beyond Overmann's control; it murdered the remainder of Union City's administrative council and established itself as the city's supreme ruler. Robert's mother Maria fled from Union City with her child after she realized the threat posed by LINC's absolute power. Union City security forces learned of Maria's plans to return to her original home in Hobart City and sabotaged her transport, causing the fateful crash that led to Robert's upbringing in The Gap.[CR]LINC now requires a new biologically-compatible human to interface with, as Overmann is near death; this was the reason Foster was forcibly brought to Union City at the beginning of the game, as well as why Reich was killed after threatening Foster. A regretful Overmann dies in Foster's arms, claiming that Robert was the only reason he clung to life for twenty long years. In order to save Foster from a lifetime of torment as LINC's new host, Joey uses his new humanoid robotic shell to interface with LINC instead, thus providing an ideal synthetic host for LINC and restoring Union City's basic administrative functions. As the citizens begin to relearn their city's computer system and take responsibility for their own lives again, a grateful Foster and Joey say their goodbyes before Foster returns to The Gap to seek out his next adventure.[CR]Re-releases & Remake[CR]Animated introductory sequence added for Beneath a Steel Sky: Remastered[CR]Beneath a Steel Sky is currently available for download from the ScummVM homepage or from GoG.com. The game also came free with the Broken Sword trilogy box set released in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2007.[CR]Released on 23 September 2009 for the price of $2.99, Beneath a Steel Sky: Remastered is an updated port of the original game for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The game remains almost entirely the same, except for improved sound and voice acting, all new animated sequences (which are drawn by the game's original artist, Dave Gibbons), and a help system that the player can take advantage of at any time. Naturally, the game supports touch control, allowing players to slide their fingers over objects to see whether or not it is interactive.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]One of the lockers in the security building has the name \"Lovecraft\" on it, in reference to early 20th century horror writer  H.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Controlled in one of the earliest uses of the WASD keyboard layout, Beyond Dark Castle pits Prince Duncan, against the guards and bizarre minions of the Black Knight. Fresh off the previous year's Dark Castle, the Black Knight has moved up from throwing beer steins and instead wishes to challenge the player to hand to hand combat. The game was also developed by Jonathan Gay and Mark Pierce of Silicon Beach Studios, just one year after the original Dark Castle debuted.[CR]The size and scope of the game are much greater than the original, with a less restrictive level hub and more elaborate levels. Where before it was limited to dungeons and caves in the first game, the Black Knight has apparently invested quite a bit of money into his castle tweaking the old locations and adding many new rooms. Especially bizarre is the computer room, which saves the game via giant levers and periodically sends out bolts of electricity that must be ducked under.[CR]The main goal of the game is to outfit the main character with the shield and fireballs, find the five magic orbs scattered at the ends of every big level chain, and use them to unlock the Black Knight's final chamber. Gameplay hasn't changed much - Prince Duncan still runs, ducks, climbs, jumps, and throws rocks, although he can now wield maces and shovels to use in duels and fly a ramshackle helicopter pack across the lengthy forest and swamp levels. There are also bombs, which have a timed fused before exploding upwards and sideways, destroying brick walls, any enemy caught in its blast, and possibly even Prince Duncan himself.[CR]Platforming segments are still the focus of the game. Many of the moving platforms are small, move quickly, and are at higher or lower elevations, which requires to be extremely careful with the jumps. Also carried over is the penalty for missing a jump, as instead of death, the player is whisked down a series of chutes into the dungeon where a key needs to be grabbed and making the way back to the level hub to start all over again. Similar to other games of its era Beyond Dark Castle is rarely forgiving.[CR]The main title screen depicts a castle parapet, with two guards slowly walking back and forth. Dark Castle used a clip of Bach's Toccata & Fugue in D Minor for its title; Beyond Dark Castle uses a clip from a later section of the same song, punctuated with blasts of thunder and lightning.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The levels are divided up into four main sections - the west tower, the east tower, clock tower, and the basement. Other than the clock tower, each section houses a single orb, and each of the towers also unlocks an ability - shield in the west tower and fireballs in the east. Neither of these skills are required to beat the game, but they will make it easier in many spots.[CR]The middle of each tower is occupied by a randomly generated labyrinth, one of the first scrolling levels found in a Dark Castle game. They're essentially a basic maze, made more difficult by the placement (or absence) of ropes to climb up or down levels, and in some spots there are spawn points to let snakes or rats drop down the ropes. Thankfully, these ropes come in clusters of three and are free to move back and forth between them in order to dodge falling enemies. The labyrinth is also timed in a way, as the player's health will steadily drop. The choice is making it to the end before it drops completely, or picking up potions along the way. There are also a great deal of bombs and fuel for the helicopter found in both labyrinths, so detouring a little bit can help later on.Game map, complete with practice buttons.[CR]The computer room found in the lower left side of the antechamber is full of switches to save the game. Proceeding upwards will be the clock tower, which has two exits - the left goes to the swamp, and the right goes to the forest. Each level is a lengthy scrolling affair with Prince Duncan manning a small helipack and throwing rocks in a bizarre medieval take on a space shooter. Vultures will fly along in space invaders cluster formations, mutants will yammer and throw rocks from below, and occasionally large birds or gargoyles will soar in directly at the player with the goal of knocking the pack clear from the player's pack. Near the end of each level is a floating eye, which follows similar shooter boss patterns and shooting rocks out at various angles. Beyond it should be the helipack, knock out a guard, and take the orb at the end.[CR]The basement is easiest to access by running into the west tower base and falling into the pit, although there is the more refined way down too. Its dungeon is an updated take on Dark Castle's dungeon, with a torturer whipping a group of three prisoners - knock him out from behind and the prisoners will nod or shake their heads when under a group of keys. Take the wrong set and get crushed by a 16 ton weight. The other variation on the original dungeon is the inclusion of five doors, with one of them is randomly chosen as the correct exit (the others simply break the key). Once out of there, the catacombs house the final orb with the only obstacles being brick walls (picking up a lot of bombs in the labyrinth will make this much easier), snakes, and a floating eye that spits fireballs.[CR]After obtaining and placing all five orbs the Black Knight's chamber is a relatively straightforward upwards affair with a duel to the death at the top.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Most of the enemies in Beyond Dark Castle are holdovers from the first game. The simple rat returns, and along with the addition of the snake marks the only enemy that won't kill the player if touched. Rats and snakes will both descend ropes if possible, although rats move at a much quicker pace as snakes tend to coil around and around the rope, thankfully giving more time to spot and dodge them (or peg them with a rock from afar).Enemy screen.[CR]The yammering rock throwing one eyed mutants also return, taunting the player, smacking their bottom in their direction, and lobbing rocks while cackling with glee and dancing around. The birds or vultures are back as well, hovering in a single spot before screeching and swooping down or sideways. They're one of the few enemies that is completely pattern based and easy to avoid.[CR]Guards are also back. They still wander back and forth on their set path and if they turn towards the player while on the same level will immediately let loose with a lethal crossbow bolt. Rocks will knock them out for about ten seconds, giving time to run past, but fireballs will down them for good (or at least until the player re-enter that area and they respawn).[CR]There are new guards, too - beefier, lazier ones. They calmly sit in a chair until the players approachs them, and then yank out a mace or shovel to battle them in a duel. The duels are relatively simple and only involve blocking their strikes and returning the strikes back, and after a few of those they'll groan and slump to the ground. The only one who isn't lazy is the brewer, who casually tosses his endless supply of mead in barrels down at the player in a bizarre blend of conveyor belts and Donkey Kong-esque barrel dodging.[CR]",

The game features a full techno soundtrack, with 1 Megabyte of sound and 3 Megabytes of graphics - both high figures for an OCS game. The playing area totals 400 screens, with animated backgrounds",

To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. [CR]The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).[CR]There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.[CR]Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.",

Body Blows was the result of this.Body Blows is as classic a SFII clone as you can possibly get and many moves for the titles main two characters (Nik and Dan) are clones of Ryu and Ken's moves from the Street Fighter series. One of the key achievements Team 17 reached when developing Body Blows is that it is one of the first titles that could run on every Amiga ever made giving the game a large player base.Body Blows was followed up by Body Blows Galactic and then Ultimate Body Blows. Both of which contained more than the 11 characters found in the original Body Blows. [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Name  DescriptionSpecial MovesDan  Nik's brother. Similar infighting style to Nik.

Compared with its predecessor it has greater graphics with better drawn and shaded figures, sadly it is slower than the original Body Blows and the collision detection is extremely frustrating.The game was released in two different versions, as an AGA version for machines like Amiga 1200/4000 which makes use of the machine's 256-colour capability. The other version is for ECS machines like Amiga 500/600 and features the standard 32-colour mode graphics. The AGA version has better graphics and better sound but the ECS version is more playable because it runs a bit faster than the AGA one.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game offers three distinct game modes:One player mode: This is a kind of a tournament where the player can choose one of the twelve characters and fight through six different planets and win the coveted title \"Galactic Champion\". On each planet the player will face the two best fighters a planet has to offer.Two player mode: Single fight against a human opponent or a cpu opponentTournament: 4 or 8 human players can contest against each other.The player can choose between 10 new massivley diverse characters all with new moves and special abilities plus two old ones(Dan and Junior) taken from Body Blows.The fighting places are located on planets.

Many levers are provided which will change the position of some of these hazards. The standard view focuses on the parent Bograt, but a mode exists to split the screen so as to allow one child to be viewed at the same time. The Bograts have different abilities and attributes, which can work both for and against you. Vulcan have used the Lemmings 2 system of a game-save system rather than Lemmings 1's passwords.",

At any time one of the bombs will blink meaning that it is active and will soon explode. These active bombs are worth more points when collected but the risk is higher since the player will die if caught within the blast radius. In this version the player character doesn't fly but has a jetpack allowing him to move vertically. In addition to exploding bombs there are also various enemies moving around that are lethal to touch. Various bonus items can be collected: B's for extra points, P's for Pac-Man-like invulnerability and L's for extra lives.The game also has an unusual two player mode where both players cooperate in controlling a single character. How this should work can be set up before starting the game. Each player can be handled different parts of the control. For example one player moves left and the other right. It's also possible to set it up so that both player has to do the same thing at the same time. So to jump both player has to press the their jump buttons at the same time.",

The goal is to find a number of hidden objects in order to open the exit to the next level. However, there are two major obstacles on the way: puzzles (mostly switch related) and enemies which try to kill Johnson. The latter problem is solved by shooting them and collecting power-ups which, for example, restore life energy or improve the gun. In other levels, the game becomes more focused on driving. The player controls a space ship (the camera is behind the vehicle) and has to survive until the end is reached. There are enemy ships to shoot as well as a boost function. There is also a third kind of level where the player moves blocks over a board in order to recreate a given pattern within a time limit.",

In the game, the player takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, who must stop the vampire Dracula. Versions of the game were released for a multitude of platforms ranging from the Amiga and NES to the Sega CD and PC.[CR]There were numerous variations between each version, though they all played similarly and shared the protagonist Jonathan Harker.NES, Game Boy, Game Gear and Sega Master System[CR]The 8-bit and portable versions of the game skewed closer to standard platformers than the other console versions, with floating platforms and other standard platformer obstacles.SNES and Genesis[CR]The 16-bit versions were action games that focused more on combat and adventure game elements than platforming. The sprite used for Harker was larger, and the games had more enemies to face down.Sega CD and Amiga[CR]Similar to the SNES and Genesis, these versions were more action-oriented. They included FMV cutscenes from the movie and digitized backgrounds.DOS[CR]The Bram Stoker's Dracula for PC MS-DOS systems was a first-person shooter, taking after games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (or Blood and Heretic, which share similar gothic horror settings).[CR]",

The player has a status display at the bottom of the screen. It contains the current score, the remaining health and shield as well as energy and credits. Energy functions as a universal ammo stock, with each of the weapon depleting a certain amount. By picking up credits, the player can buy or upgrade weapons at computer terminals.[CR]The player's goal is to reach the exit of each of the 20 levels. However, there are usually doors in the way that have to be opened by finding the right switches, or obtaining certain key cards to progress further into the maze.",

[CR]During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a \"taunt\" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. [CR]Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday is based on TSR's Buck Rogers XXVC setting created in the late eighties and based on the character whose exploits had been seen in nearly every medium and through several revivals since his debut in 1928. In this adventure, players must help Buck Rogers uncover and destroy a doomsday weapon that could spell the end of resistance to the empire that holds Earth within its grasp.[CR]SSI adapted the Buck Rogers setting (another TSR property using the same rules) using the Gold Box Engine that they had pioneered with its work within the Forgotten Realms campaign setting via such titles as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds.[CR]Based as it was on the \"Gold Box Engine\", players interfaced with the game via a grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. Party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]The console variant of the game eschewed the 3D exploration interface in favor of an isometric view instead, although the tactical combat view was still included.[CR]The game is a sci-fi role player, although it uses the same rules as AD&D (which was the case with its tabletop original). Classes and weapons are analogous to certain aspects of the system, but it is firmly rooted within its high-tech setting.[CR]The packaging, as was typical of SSI's attention to detail as exemplified by their treatment of the Gold Box series of games, took this opportunity to immerse the player within the fiction of its world via an included booklet outlining its history and systems.[CR]Included were:The Rule Book (manual)A logbook containing the history leading up from 1990 to 2356 (the date the game takes place) and describing the systems that it uses as well as text paragraphs describing different areas of the gameAnd a data card (a quick-start card on how to get started with the game on specific machines)[CR]The main disks of the game could be freely copied, although players would be challenged to find certain words within one of the booklets that the game had come with in order to proceed as a test. This mechanic would also be used in a variety of other games within SSI's RPG lineup.[CR]The logbook doubled as a key part of the game as it contained dialogue, scene descriptions, and maps that it would reference. This technique was also used in several other RPGs such as Wasteland and Dragon Wars. As with those titles, Countdown to Doomsday's paragraphs also contained several red herrings designed to mislead players who chose to read ahead and potentially spoil the story for themselves.[CR]Setting[CR]One of the restrictions of the creative credo governing the franchise is that the realism of Buck Rogers' world had to be based on what could be scientifically plausible and possible - hard science as opposed to more fantastic versions. As a result, the series was focused more on the Solar System and the problems associated with terraforming its planets as well as traveling among them.[CR]As another result, the history of game reflects this within its protagonists. In 1999, the United States and the Soviet Union engage in a final war, exchanging blows via nuclear weapons. As a result of this terrible conflict, conventional warfare is abandoned and the survivors band themselves into large alliances. The Russo-American Mercantile (RAM) forms out of an alliance between what is left of Russia and the United States, for example. The Indo-Asian Consortium (IAC) and the Euro-Bloc Faction (EBF) also form and become the pre-eminent superpowers of the day.[CR]Over the next few centuries, these superpowers form an alliance of their own to expand their efforts into space and colonize the planets. RAM colonizes Mars, the Moon (Luna) is colonized by the EBF, and Venus is colonized by the IAC. Fusion rockets transport men and materials to their destinations throughout the Solar System.[CR]In 2275, RAM revolts against an increasingly oppressive Earth government. Venus signs a nonaggression pact with Mars and ten years of war follow. Battered, broken, and cut off from its colonies, Earth starves allowing RAM's forces to dominate what is left. The colonized worlds continue to grow on their own, developing their own unique socieities thanks to the success of their terraforming efforts. for example, Mercury develops a thriving industry based on mining and solar power.[CR]Humanity has also changed with its expansion into the Solar System. Earth is still home to those now known as the Terrans. Mercury's people have become strong and powerful. The Martians have become prideful with their successes, and the Venusians have focused more on matters of study and of the mind.[CR]However, in the first half of the 25th century, the New Earth Organization is set up by Terrans (Earth natives) that seek to overthrow RAM and restore Earth to its former glory. With the revival of Buck Rogers from cryogenic sleep and with his daring leadership and heroic exploits across the Solar System, NEO manages to thwart RAM's attempts to stop them.[CR]High technology has also enabled the construction of robots and Digital Personalities, programs that emulate human thought and emotion but think at the speed of a computer. Genetic engineering on a vast scale has also created tailored creatures found on specific worlds, each made to fulfill either a specific purpose during terraforming or as part of a new product line. As another example, RAM makes use of Combat Gennies, disposable soldiers bred and equipped to fight their wars.[CR]This is the world that the player will be caught up within as they do their part to stop RAM and its allies.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player's party are new NEO recruits and arrive at Chicagorg (formerly Chicago, but far larger) to undergo their final training when it is attacked by RAM troops. If they manage to fend off the attack and save the base, they join efforts to salvage what is left and discover a RAM ship among the wreckage.[CR]Entering the ship, they discover a RAM science program named Scot.dos who joins them as he wishes to defect to NEO after having enough of RAM. Onboard, they discover a batch of ECGs (Experimental Combat Gennies), genetically enhanced soldiers, and find a way to stop them before they mature and create problems for Earth. Scot.dos tells them that the ECGs were created on an asteroid base which they go to investigate.[CR]At the research facility, they discover other projects that RAM is involved with, one of which happens to be a very powerful, laser-based weapon capable of demolishing entire cities at will. A series of satellite reflectors are also being used as a part of its aiming system, and the party is able to destroy these before heading out to Mars where the weapon is located and a test is scheduled.[CR]Unfortunately for them, space pirates under the employ of RAM capture them with the intention of selling them off to their enemies. But Buck Rogers, who has been following a rumor that the pirate leader, Talon, may be employed by RAM, intervenes and helps the party damage the ship to prevent pursuit while they escape.[CR]On Mars, they eventually discover the base where a smaller version of the weapon is being tested and destroy it. They also learn that one of the components for the real weapon is being manufactured on Venus and head there to learn more on what is going on, discovering that the Doomsday Laser is housed on a solar satellite (a Mercurian Mariposa) controlled by a Mercurian noble called the Sun King.[CR]Believing that the party are actually there to help the Sun King take over the Doomsday Laser for himself, the minions of the Sun King let them pass through security. There, the party discovers that the Laser is already targeting Earth and cause a power outage to delay the countdown. After setting it to self destruct and fighting their way from the core of the Mariposa, they manage to escape and watch as the Marisposa explodes taking the Doomsday Laser with it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a party-based RPG using the same engine that SSI had initially built for its Gold Box titles such as Pool of Radiance. As a result, it has many visual cues that make it appear very similar to its more fantastic cousins, but the differences lie mainly within its gameplay conventions.[CR]With the use of more conventional armaments, such as laser guns and plasma throwers, ranged attacks have a greater emphasis in this game. The use of grenades and other explosives are considered key to winning many battles quickly. As it is also space-based, the use of that medium has also opened the door on opportunities to attack and board enemy spaceships, often giving them a great deal of loot to recover and sell if need be.[CR]Limited dialogue with NPCs, puzzles, and the exploration of bases, secret laboratories, caves, and a variety of other venues are also found throughout the game.[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what career a character may be restricted in playing as.Races[CR]There are six races that players can choose from in order to build their party. Four of these are considered \"human\" types while two others are \"gennies\", those that have been bred to include certain other attributes that lie outside of the human gene pool.Terrans - These are unengineered humans. They can be a part of any career path and have no distinct weaknesses with fairly average statistics across the board.Venusians - Venus' civilization is a diverse mix of cultures and are often involved as traders, farmers, or herdsmen. They can also be a part of any career path.Martians - They are the oldest and most advanced civilization in the Solar System having benefited from RAM's continuing work there. Because of the lower gravity on Mars, they are slightly weaker than Terrans but equal to most everyone else. Any career path is open to them.Mercurians - Mercury is ruled by the Sun Kings, those descended from the original owners of the great Mariposa solar satellites that orbit the planet, holding court within their palaces. Three other cultures live on the surface of Mercury, descended from the refugees that had fled the chaos of the rest of the Solar System. They can be a part of any career path.Tinkerers - These were bioengineered with lemurs and gibbons to be able to work in small spaces and maintain machinery. As a result, they are very good with technology, but they are restricted to only to careers: Engineer and Medic.Desert Runners - One of the oldest bioengineered races, they were bred to survive on the harsh surface of Mars during its latter terraforming years. They bear feline features from the genetic stock they were mixed with, can run long distances, and fight with their own claws if need be. They are great fighters and good with their hands which help considering that they are restricted to the Rocketjock, Warrior, and Engineer career paths.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Warriors must have a good Strength score in order to be effective in melee combat.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as with a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as laser rifles, bolt guns, and even their ability to pilot a rocketship without crashing.Constitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. Sheer physical toughness.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a character, especially the leader. Helps with Intimidation and Acting.Intelligence (INT) - This is required for most of the careers in the game and reflects wit and memory. Still prized in the 25th Century.Wisdom (WIS) - Common sense and important to Medics in their practice, Rogues in keeping them from robbing the wrong people, and aids in certain skills.Tech (TCH) - Technical Knowhow that determines a character's affinity for machines and equipment. If a character has a high Tech skill, they have a better grasp on fixing things as well as people.[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are allotted across them as a result. For examples, Desert Runners are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]This game does not use an alignment system. The party is expected to be on the side of \"the good guys\".Careers[CR]Instead of classes, Buck Rogers' uses a system based on careers instead with a series of skills associated with each one.Rocketjocks - They are the pilots of the Solar System, the daredevils that can drive anything as long as it can move.Warriors - These are seasoned fighters dedicated to the arts of combat. Every second level (2nd, 4th, etc..), warriors also earn a specialization bonus to their weapon of choice up to a maximum plus of 3 for each one.Medics - Advanced technology only means that medics can work their miracles even better than before. They can use onboard Medical Centers, cure poison, and otherwise bandage everyone back up.Rogues - No security system can stand in their way for long and they can also stay out of sight when someone comes looking for something they may be missing.Engineers - If it's broken, they can fix it. Not quite as much of a braggart as a Rocketjock, but they're close.Skills[CR]The also uses an extensive skill system based on what career a character has chosen along with a number of general skills that each can also develop, roughly similar to that used in Interplay's post-apocalyptic RPG, Wasteland.[CR]These represent a character's expertise with a particular field. Every new character gets an allotment of points to distribute among their career's skills and every level-up awards them with 40 points to distribute among their abilities. A maximum total of eighty points can be assigned to any one skill which translated as a percentage. Ability skills, such as those under the heading for Dexterity, also benefit from its score.[CR]For example, if the Pick Pocket skill has 20 points allocated to it and the character's Dexterity is 16, the end total for the skill would be 36 which translates into a success percentile of 36%.[CR]One unusual factor to consider is that among the skills offered to the player in this game, not all of them are actually used. The reason behind this is that they have been included in anticipation of the sequel, although this won't prevent a player from putting points into those skills.[CR]Dexterity SkillsAcrobatics - The skill of balanceClimb - The ability to scale over obstacles without equipmentDrive Groundcar - Anything on the ground is fair game. Not used in the game.Drive Jetcar - Ability to use a car powered by jets.

They are, in the order of easiest to hardest:NoviceCadetTrooperVeteranAce[CR]The game is preset at \"Trooper\" difficulty which is considered the average, or median, range of difficulty that is not too hard for newcomers yet not too easy as to present little challenge.[CR]The party-based Gold Box series of RPGs had standardized themselves on the engine that was pioneered with this game for both exploration and combat explaining the similarities between each one. Although each subsequent game would feature tweaks and modifications as a result of further gameplay enhancements, the basic structure and approach within this formula was always the same.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacker shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.Space Combat[CR]With rocket ships and pilots, the game also involves space combat which is handled both from the pilot's perspective and that of the crew's. From the Pilot's Menu, the player can fire its weapons, target specific systems on the enemy ship, ram the enemy vessel, or even board it once they have pummeled it to the point where it can no longer move.This is not in real-time.[CR]During combat, the player can also give orders to the crew to help repair the ship, jury rig systems to get them working again, boost the engines, use sensors to probe the other vessel (thus revealing additional information), or administer aid to those injured.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Budokan: The Martial Spirit is a video game by Electronic Arts, originally released in 1989. The game saw release on multiple platforms, including Amiga, DOS, Sega Genesis, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game starts with the player at the gates of the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo, the training hall headed by Tobiko-Sensei. In order to continue and enter the courtyard, the game requires you to identify a family crest which is displayed on the screen, typical of the copy protection methodology employed by PC games in those days.[CR]The game mechanics are vastly different than what are commonly employed in the 2D fighting game franchises that followed it (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Samurai Shodown, et al). Combat is heavily focused on single strikes from a variety of stances, which you engage and disengage by pressing towards and away, respectively. (Movement is handled with the diagonals, down-towards and down-away.)[CR]Thus, where other games mix up your attacks by employing multiple buttons and mixing in the distance from your opponent, Budokan allows you specific control over whether you strike with (for example) a front kick, side kick, or a reverse roundhouse kick, and whether that kick is aimed at the head, chest or shin, using only the d-pad and a single button. Which strike you use is determined by (a) the stance that you engage to open the attack and (b) the directional button that you end up pressing when you finally press the Strike button. (Blocking is handled similarly, and requires the same amount of attention to precision with regards to high, medium and low.)[CR]Examples:Street Fighter II, Dhalsim's stretch double punch: Stay far away, press Fierce punchStreet Fighter II, Dhalsim's two-hit headbutt: Get in close, press Fierce punchBudokan, Karate side-kick: press away to engage side-kick stance, then press attackBudokan, Karate front-kick: press towards to engage front-kick stance, then press attackBudokan, Karate reverse roundhouse kick: press towards to engage front-kick stance, then press away and attackBudokan, Karate chest punch: press and hold attack to engage punching/blocking stance, then press towardsBudokan, Karate mid-block: press and hold attack to engage punching/blocking stance, then press away[CR]While it offers maximum control and is arguably what makes Budokan unique, the mechanics can also be a bit cumbersome and lead to slower, more plodding matches when compared to the faster-moving 2D fighters of today. There are no physics-defying special moves such as fireball or body launcher attacks.[CR]Below your stamina meter (which recovers slowly over time), there is a \"Ki\" meter that builds up very slowly when you're not attacking, and though it's not really analogous to today's \"Super\" meters, the higher your Ki is when attacking, the harder you strike (after which the Ki empties out). Thus it's entirely possible (though quite difficult) to knock out an adversary in a single strike after defending and withholding attacks long enough to fill up your Ki entirely.Fighting Styles[CR]Throughout the game, you have the ability to choose from four different fighting styles. The following styles are available:Karate: Unarmed martial arts styleKendo: Form of Japanese fencing with use of a wooden swordNunchaku: A weapon consisting of two sticks connected by a chain or ropeBo: A long wooden staffTraining[CR]Once in the courtyard, you can select from five different dojos, all of which allow you to practice individual fighting styles. The available training options are jiyu-renshu (practice), kumite (sparring against instructors), and Budokan (tournament). By entering the dojos, you will enter the training mode and be able to practice your moves.Budokan[CR]Aside from training, you also have the option of entering the tournament at the Budokan. In this tournament, you will face challengers which use fighting styles that are not practiced at the dojo. The player can only choose a single fighting style a maximum of four times. The tournament pits you against twelve different challengers.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]While the game only features one playable character, you do face a variety of challengers in the Budokan tournament, all with their own individual styles and weapons.Goro Suzuki[CR]Dojo: Ozeki-Ryu[CR]Rank: Shodan[CR]Weapon: Karate[CR]Goro is better known for his sushi-eating ability than his karate skill, but don't underestimate him. He's got a good punch and a hefty kick. You'd better stay alert.Eiji Kimura[CR]Dojo: Yagyu-Ryu[CR]Rank: Shodan[CR]Weapon: Kendo[CR]Known around town as the \"kamikaze kid,\" Eiji knows only one thing -- all out offensive fighting. He'll want to take you out early, so watch out for his opening combination.Jimmy Doran[CR]Dojo: Shito-Ryu[CR]Rank: Nidan[CR]Weapon: Tonfa[CR]Jimmy was introduced to karate when his dad was station on Okinawa. He quickly fell in love with the beauty of its form and its spiritual depth. Dedicated and serious, Jimmy is solid karate-ka.Shigeo Kawahara[CR]Dojo: None[CR]Rank: No Rank[CR]Weapon: Nunchaku[CR]Shigeo has spent the last two years on a deserted island striving to perfect his nunchaku technique. Undefeated in local tournaments, he'll crush your spirit if it isn't strong.Tetsuo Okabe[CR]Dojo: Miyate-Ryu[CR]Rank: Sandan[CR]Weapon: Bo[CR]He quit his full-time job as a \"salary man\" to devote his life to the study of budo. Okabe-san's hard and diligent training shows in his strong techniques. Keep your guard up and the pressure on.Arnie Gustafson[CR]Dojo: Hakutsu-Kai[CR]Rank: Godan[CR]Weapon: Karate[CR]Martial arts continue to thrive in Europe as exemplified by Arnie. His strength has earned him top rankings worldwide. His kicks are fast, powerful, and accurate. Respect him.Hiroshi Ikeda[CR]Dojo: Araki-Ryu[CR]Rank: Hachidan[CR]Weapon: Kusari-Gama[CR]\"Mountain Man\" Ikeda lives in a small secluded village high atop Mt. Ueno. Once a year, he travels to Tokyo to compete in the Budokan. Unfortunately for you, he has returned again this year.Miyuki Hirose[CR]Dojo: Shinkage-Ryu[CR]Rank: Yondan[CR]Weapon: Naginata[CR]She started training at age ten and continues to improve and refine her technique. Don't let her delicate appearance fool you - it may be the last mistake you will ever make.Randy Wu[CR]Dojo Sekiguchi-Kai[CR]Rank: Hachidan[CR]Weapon: Nunchaku[CR]Randy started his training in Honolulu but then decided to move to Japan and study under the notorious \"White Tiger,\" Mizukami-Sensei. His style may be rather unorthodox, but it is deadly.Ayako Maruyama[CR]Dojo: Unknown[CR]Rank: Unknown[CR]Weapon: Ninjitsu[CR]People speculate that Ayako studies a very ancient and obscure form of Ninjitsu. Though many argue about its origins, there's no arguing about its effectiveness.Kazuo Sakata[CR]Dojo: Hozo-in[CR]Rank: Shichidan[CR]Weapon: Yari[CR]\"Fight hard, fight fair, and fight with honor!\" are the words that Kazuo lives by. He abides by the strict Bushido code of honor, so mind your etiquette in battle.Tokage[CR]Dojo: Unknown[CR]Rank: Unknown[CR]Weapon: Various[CR]\"Tokage,\" the Chameleon, has the unnerving ability to mimic and copy his opponent's fighting styles. Your most formidable enemy turns out to be yourself![CR]",

The score in this round depends on the distance from the girl which the knife lands. The closer the knife gets to the assistant girl without hitting her the higher the score.[CR]Trick Shooting / Bottle Shooting: This mini game is reminiscent of Operation Wolf and Cabal. The player has to shoot the enemy targets as they pop up but not shoot young ladies or innocent people in the back or the Sheriff. During the second section of this mini game bottles have to be shot when thrown in the air.[CR]Calf Roping: In the third game the player has to prove his cowboy skills by roping a cattle within the time limit. On horseback a calf has to be followed by moving the joystick up, down, left and right. If close enough the lasso can be slipped over the calf's head by pressing the fire button and the calf can be brought into a halt by pulling back the joystick.[CR]Bronco Riding: It is a necessary skill for any cowboy and that's exactly what the fourth game is. The player has to remain seated on the bucking bronco by pushing the joystick in the direction indicated by arrows which appear on-screen. The score increases the longer the player stays on.[CR]Steer Wrestling: In the fifth game a steer has to be chased and wrestled down. Therefor the player must get on horseback as close as possible to the steer and jump on the steer by pressing the fire button. To overbalance the steer the joystick has to be waggled left and right until it falls to the ground.[CR]Stage Coach Rescue: The last game is all about catching and jumping on to a moving stagecoach to stop a renegade Indian who has captured it and is terrorising the passengers. Wiggling the joystick left and right makes the horse run towards the stage. Moving the joystick up and down allows the player to avoid the suitcases which the Indian throws at him. Once alongside the coach it can be climbed aboard by pressing the fire button. The Indian can now be punched by pushing the joystick up (head punch) or down (stomach punch). Pushing left and right blocks the Indian's punches.[CR]",

It features the dwarven thief Karadoc as he follows a tip to raid the Castle Wulf: a gloomy structure rumored to be full of traps and treasure. It was part of a string of hits for UK developers The Bitmap Brothers during the late 80s/early 90s.[CR]The gameplay is largely focused around completing puzzles and evading enemies and traps. It requires that the player find and use key items to progress or by manipulating the game's physics engine, such as pushing a block to reveal a key or moving barrels to create platforms across a gap. Karadoc can level up by defeating enemies which will increase his maximum amount of health, and players can use the treasure he finds to save the game for as long as they have the funds to do so.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]\"Legend has it that Castle Wulf is filled with treasure so the thief Karadoc decided to raid it. Unfortunately the legend didn't say anything about the castle also being filled with deadly traps, riddles and monsters. It's not all about surviving though, proving Karadoc's worth collecting objects, putting the objects to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods is also necessary. Quick reflexes and jumping skills are also needed.\"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players are expected to explore the castle, avoiding enemies if possible and discovering how to collect the treasures around the castle without setting off the devious traps.[CR]The player controls Karadoc, a dwarven thief, who is able to grab, move and throw objects. Some of the items can be interacted with in different ways: Clicking on them brings up commands like \"pick up\", \"drink\", \"open\" or \"insert\". Most of the puzzles in the game are solved with these commands.[CR]Several items are needed to progress further, such as keys for unlocking doors, rocks for hitting switches or pickaxes for breaking down walls. It is, in effect, a lot like a graphic adventure game, where success hinges on the correct use of items to solve puzzles.[CR]Cadaver also has a sequel: Cadaver: The Payoff. There's also additional stages that were given away as cover-disc demos.[CR]",

California Games II was released in 1990 for the Amiga, and later for several other systems, including MS-DOS, Sega Master System, SNES, and Atari ST. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in five different events.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the game's five events.[CR]Just like in California Games, there are several events that the player can play through. In California Games II, these five events are hang gliding, jet skiing, body boarding, snowboarding, and skateboarding. The player completes each of the five events sequentially, and then is awarded a point total at the end, depending on the player's performance throughout the events.EventsHang Gliding[CR]Hang gliding puts the player in control of a hang glider flying over the ocean. The goal in this game is to drop water balloons in three different tubes, each of which yields points, all while avoiding prematurely falling in the water.Jet Skiing[CR]In the jet skiing minigame, the goal is to complete a course as fast as possible. The player is giving buoy guidelines to follow, as well as time-reducing checkpoints and ramps. If the player fails to complete it in time, they are still awarded points, but less so than a fully completed course would yield.Body Boarding[CR]In the bodysurfing event, the player is put in control of a character swimming in the ocean. The goal is to do tricks off of a large wave in order to gain points. Failure to complete tricks, or falling off of the wave results in penalization for the player.Snowboarding[CR]Snowboarding starts the player off in the middle of a slope. The goal here is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible, and to hit the ramp at the end of the cliff face. Unlike other games, the player is given several falls before the event is failed completely.Skateboarding[CR]Hearkening to games such as Skate or Die, the skateboarding minigame puts the player in control of a skater on a half-pipe course, going through tunnels and doing tricks along the way.[CR]",

You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank, direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from both sides are featured.[CR]It's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the \"aficionados\" of the genre.

With the backing of the Pope, the three most powerful dukes, and a horde of laborers, carpenters and craftsmen, the player must battle the Celts and rule all of Bretagne![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The central gameplay mechanic is the designing, construction and defense of the player's castles. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses either a 1, 3, or 8 castle campaign. Each successive level is more challenging, due to more difficult and frequent attacks, and less-hospitable terrain. The player is provided with an overhead view of the terrain of which he is looking to conquer. He can then choose from several pieces to place, and design his/her castle. These pieces include, towers, walls, gates, and moats. Layout choices will directly affect how well the castle can defend against enemies.[CR]After the player has designed his castle, he must go about the business of managing his kingdom via the menus that are available to him/her. The player can alter taxes, hire or dismiss labor, levy military troops and buy food to prepare for a siege. Castle walls must be built one level and one section at a time. Battlements can be designed with defensive elements such as arrow slits and boiling cauldrons of oil.[CR]The time of year has an effect on gameplay, as castle construction must halt during the winter, taxes are collected every spring, laborers and military units are hired over time, etc... Other events also rely on the passage of time.[CR]Every month, a messenger arrives and brings you news of something that has occurred within the player's kingdom. The player is then given several choices in how to respond to these occurrences, with each choice resulting in a meaningfully different outcome. These choices are presented via a pop-up screen, with an image of the king thinking to himself about the choice at hand.[CR]The player will suffer frequent attacks by the Celts, and other adversaries, especially in later levels. When this occurs, the player must place his gathered armies using any number of strategies (hide in the castle with archers on the walls, a large force of ground units at a choke point in the castle, small groups of units working together, etc), and then allow for the combat to play out. Unfinished castle sections are much less effective at keeping the enemy out. Enemy units will arrive from an unknown direction and begin trying to destroy the castle. If the player's castle is destroyed, the game is over.[CR]Over time, the labor force of the Kingdom can be seen making progress on the player's castle. Progress is based on the happiness of the players population as well as the makeup of his labor force. Specialists are required to perform many of the building functions (wood workers for scaffolding and gates, stone masons for walls, etc). The player must decide how many resources to devote to workers/walls/moats/etc, resulting in many diverse and interesting gameplay possibilities that have a real impact on the outcome. When work the castle is completed, a larger battle will begin. If the castle survives, the player finishes that level, and moves on to a more difficult castle-building task at a new location.[CR]Graphics[CR]The graphics in Castles are standard 256 color VGA. Individual laborers are given discernible feature (horses, tools etc...) along with accompanying animations. Building progress is shown in functional detail. Several more detailed and realized stills also exist within the game. Castle planning is done from a flat overhead view, while combat, and progress can also be watched from a 3/4th isometric perspective.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Castles features a fairly standard MIDI soundtrack.[CR]",

[CR]Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. [CR]One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. [CR]Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. [CR]When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight. [CR]When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. [CR]Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.",

It continues to the use the Gold Box engine first pioneered with Pool of Radiance and then enhanced for use in this series with Gateway to the Savage Frontier. Because it is based on the same engine behind SSI's Gold Box series of RPGs. only the setting has changed.[CR]The game, based as it is on the Gold Box engine, continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, a tactical turn-based system was used to display the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]Upon starting, a verification question is shown which directed the player to find the indicated word answer in either the rule book (the manual) or the included Adventurer's Journal. The disks themselves did not have any copy protection allowing players to make copies and play on them instead.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructions and an outline of the rulesAn Adventurer's Journal going into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the game; it would also double as an additional layer of copy protection as it contained the scene description references for the game. It would also recount a summary of the War of the Lance leading up to the events in the post-war environment of Ansalon and where the party steps in to help solve a mysteryA Quick Reference card for commands[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]It is the end of the War of the Lance and the forces of good have reclaimed the continent of Ansalon from the Dragon Armies of the Dark Queen and Goddess, Takhisis. Outposts have been built to watch over these lands as the armies that had fought for them slowly returned to their homes. The player's party is sent to one of these outposts to help keep watch. However, not everything is as it seems as rumors of strange occurrences and behavior among the soldiers already there make the rounds.[CR]Although the forces of darkness have been vanquished leaving only stragglers behind to threaten travelers, the party's first patrol out encounter a draconian raiding party. As the party struggles to help the travelers that are being attacked, they witness an aurak draconian seize an ancient book from their cargo and Dimension Door away, ignoring them.[CR]They return to the outpost only to discover that a Solamnic Knight, Sir Karl, is fighting their commandant! He manages to kill him and as the commandant falls, his body transforms into that of a sivak draconian. Sir Karl explains that he has been sent by his order to investigate reports of renewed evil within the region and the party quickly fill him in on what they have discovered in their own patrol. Sir Karl realizes that the outpost has been used as a convenient, and secret, base of operations for evil. By taking it over and sending back false messages, the forces that had infiltrated it have slowly wiped out the real defenders.[CR]Concerned at the state of the other outposts and the defenders assigned to protect them, Sir Karl indicates to the party that they must travel to Throtl, an abandoned hobgoblin city currently occupied by forces led by Caramon Majere, one of the Heroes of the Lance. In attempting to enter the city, the party force their way past the hobgoblin guards and discover that it is overrun with the undead wearing the armor of the missing patrols. They discover the Caramon was ambushed and captured and manage to free him. He tells them that the draconians are attempting to create more of themselves by corrupting more good dragon eggs somewhere within the city.[CR]The party eventually find a temple where evil priests are attempting to change the good dragon eggs, performing the same rituals that had created the draconians in the first place in order to create another army. The attempt is a failure, however, as they do not have the complete rite which was lost during the War, although the party discovers evidence of something called \"The Plan\". Fighting their way through Throtl, they recover some of the eggs and with Caramon's report, provide enough proof that the forces of good must mobilize once more to counter this new threat before it is too late.[CR]At the next outpost, the party is sent to Gargath on the rumors that there may be a Dragonlance hidden there. These weapons were used in the War of the Lance to help destroy the evil dragons that led the armies of Takhisis across Ansalon. However, the city is already under the control of evil infiltrators who the party fights through. The Dragonlance, however, has already been seized by Myrtani, the aurak draconian who was seen with the book earlier, and as he leaves, taunts the party.[CR]The party is then sent to Jelek to investigate the city as well as obtain a silver rose for Sir Karl. They discover that someone named Sir Lebaum has been very active in building an undead army. After fighting their way through the undead there, they continue their adventures and slowly whittle even more of evil's grip on the lands around them. They gain a powerful ally in the spirit of Sir Dargaard in one such adventure and an ally in the ogre, Gravnak.[CR]Eventually, the party make their way to the Southern Outpost. No one has heard from this remote base in awhile, so the party is sent to investigate why. They quickly discover that it has also fallen to the forces of evil and fight to clear them out before returning to the main outpost to inform Sir Karl of their work.[CR]But Sir Karl has gone missing, but an ally of his arrives to help. Maya, a Silver Dragon...as well as Sir Karl's lover...takes them to the fell city of Neraka and must fight their way through its powerful defenders to free the kidnapped Knight. They find the Solamnic Knight as well as Tanis Half-Elven, another Hero of the Lance, fighting to free the slaves held there. Unfortunately, Sir Karl dies in his escape attempt.[CR]As the forces of good continue to gather and prepare to march against the city of Sanction, the party goes to the city of Sanction ahead of them in order to prepare the way. Sanction has been discovered to be a part of Myrtani's plan and as the armies march against it, the forces of evil within its walls prepare themselves for the assault. They battle their way through Sanction and finally face off against Sir Lebaum who is really a Death Knight. In a climactic battle, the party manage to defeat this powerful agent of evil, but not before his messengers leave to deliver word to his master, Myrtani, that the Plan is succeeding.[CR]Unbeknownst to the party, this is exactly what Myrtani had wanted to happen all along. By luring the forces of good to believe that Sanction was the real threat, they will be expected to muster their best in the attack. What they don't know is how powerful the undead army that Sir Lebaum has put together is nor the attack that Myrtani will stage from against them in order to crush the forces of good in a trap that the party has unwittingly set for them. Aided by gold dragons, the party take off after the messengers and encounter a flying citadel over the city of Kernen.[CR]They assault the citadel, aided by another Hero, Tasselhoff Burrfoot, and take control of it. Tasselhoff flies the mighty structure into another citadel, throwing the party into it and forcing them to escape before it also falls from the sky. Once they have done so, they find themselves in Kernen and penetrate the main gate into the base. After many battles, they confront Myrtani and manage to defeat him, ultimately ending the threat to Ansalon. The book that he had stolen was the complete ritual to converting dragon eggs into draconians. The second phase of the plan would have involved many of these newly created draconians to fall upon the forces of good as they battled the undead army, catching them in between these two armies and then grinding them into obivion.[CR]Had it not been for one party of brave adventurers and their allies, he might have succeeded in sparking another War.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Champions of Krynn is the first game in the Dragonlance series of SSI's Gold Box titles. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use in this campaign series with few changes. All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 2nd edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.[CR]Players begin Champions of Krynn by creating a party of six heroes. The parameters used in creating each character include race, class, affiliation & alignment as well as the likeness of the icon that will appear in combat. These factors will dictate what sorts of weapons & armor your characters can use, if they use magic & what kind of spells they can learn.[CR]After creating the type of character, players can determine the value of a series of attributes that he or she will begin the game with. Players can roll and re-roll their statistics until satisfied with the levels of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Hit Points, Armor Class and Experience Points. Players' approach to the game will depend on the mix of characters to be added to your party.[CR]Once the party is assembled, gameplay consists of taking assignments from the commandants of Knight outposts and NPCs in the towns which you visit as well as encounters you have while traveling between locations on the overworld map. Combat is turn based and includes character movement which impacts tactical decisions such as ranged vs melee attacks, deployment of party members and order of targeting. Successful battles will result in the party earning XP & currency as well as looting items and weapons from your fallen enemies.Races[CR]With the introduction of the Gold Box series as a part of the Dragonlance campaign series with this title, seven races are now available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new characte.[CR]Players can also select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.Mountain Dwarves: Excellent warriors, expert craftsmen, and strong workers, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. Their hate for goblins and hobgoblins also gives them bonuses in battle against their kind. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Hill Dwarves: They are just as stubborn and as tough as Mountain Dwarves although not as charmismatic.Qualinesti Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others. They are also much friendlier than their Silvanesti cousins.Silvanesti Elves: They are just like the Qualinesti, although are typically more arrogant.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Human: The most common race on Ansalon, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Kender: They are a diminutive people who bear an extreme curiosity often \"misinterpreted\" by others as thievery. They are very resistant to magic and poison and can easily taunt others with a silver tongue often making their opponents go into an uncontrollable rage. Their dexterity adds to their accuracy with their weapon of choice, the hoopak, or in picking a few locks to satisfy their inquisitive nature.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities as defined by the 2ed AD&D rules that the game is based on.[CR]These determine factors such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Solamnic Knights - They are the pinnacle of chivalric honor on Krynn and are divided into three orders: the Knights of the Crown, the Knights of the Sword, and the illustrious Knights of the Rose. They start out with plate mail, a long sword, and a shield, but with very few coins to spend. In addition to this vow of poverty, 10% of their monies are sent back to the order every time an outpost is visited. When Knights of the Sword or Rose rise to sixth level, they are able to use some clerical spells.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it. Clerics can only be of an alignment the same as that of their chosen god.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield. On Ansalon, their spells are also affected by the wax and wane of its moons. As with Knights, mages are also split into three orders based on alignment with their own strengths, abilities, and favored moon.White Robes - good aligned mages belong to this orderRed Robes - those of a neutral persuasion belong to this orderBlack Robes - evil mages are often members of this order; cannot be PC characters in this game[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.The Moons of Magic[CR]The three moons of Krynn figure prominently within the game's magic system depending on their phases: Solinari (the white moon), Lunitari (the red moon), Nuitari (the black moon). Their phases are displayed onscreen as a part of the interface.[CR]Mages of the White Robes, for example, gain their power from the white moon, Solinari, and gain two additional memorized spells as a result of it being a full moon.Locations[CR]Several locations are available at each town and outpost within the game, offering a number of services and opportunities to explore:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an areaVault - Maintained by the Solamnic Order, deposits of money (not equipment) can be made at each branch in allotments of 100 pieces at a time. A fee is also charged for the service.Commandant's Office - Where the party goes to receive mission briefingsOverland[CR]Overland travel was displayed when the party left a civilized area such as a town or an outpost. Cursor keys allowed the player to maneuver them across this map and the Area command could toggle the view between the 3D first-person look or back to the overland view depending on availability. Random encounters would often make travel dangerous, but unavoidable. Likewise, travelers encountered on the road may offer their help with certain services.[CR]Proximity to certain areas on the map will generate specific encounter groups based on the makeup of the region. For example, moving further east into dangerous lands will spawn encounters with hill giants, great spiders, and draconians.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.[CR]",

The player has an important mission, named \"Eyes of the Eagle\", to accomplish: Visit the planet Andromeda in order to free a kidnapped scientist. Needless to say, the fate of the galaxy depends on it.The most important part is exploring the map from a top-down perspective. Interactions with the world or in-game menus are conducted by using one of the symbols which are placed on the border around the playing screen, e.g. talking to other characters which may provide clues.Unfortunately there are also enemies roaming on the planet which, because movement happens in real-time, may be avoided or fought on a separate battle screen - later in the game helpful android can be used during combat. The player character can divide points on character statistics like strength or wisdom.",

Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles.[CR]The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.[CR]Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sid Meier's Civilization is a turn-based  4X strategy game developed and published by  MicroProse for  MS-DOS in 1991. Designed by  Sid Meier, it is the first game in the  long-running series of the same name and the first game to popularize the 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) sub-genre of strategy games. Players take on the role of a ruler of a civilization (loosely based on real-life historical civilizations) and is challenged to build it up amongst other empires (from two to six), from the end of the prehistoric era to the technological future.[CR]Over the years, the game received ports to the  Mac,  Amiga,  Atari ST,  Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published by  Koei in the United States and by  Asmik Ace in Japan),  PlayStation (published in Japan only by  Asmik Ace), and  N-Gage. A special port for the  Windows, titled  Sid Meier's CivNet, was released in 1995, featuring online multiplayer.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Sid Meier, a founder of MicroProse and veteran game designer, had established his name in the industry with such titles as Pirates!, Railroad Tycoon, and a variety of flight simulators. Drawing inspiration from two board games, Civilization from Avalon Hill and Risk, and two recently released computer games,  Populous and  SimCity, Meier set to work with Bruce Shelley on Civilization.[CR]While the game would see release via MicroProse, and Meier was a co-founder of the company, at the time of Civilization's creation, Meier was not an employee of MicroProse. Meier's former MicroProse partner, Bill Stealey, had changed the direction of the company away from PC games and into the home console and arcade market. Meier jumped ship prior to MicroProse going public.[CR]Inspired by their work on Railroad Tycoon, a deviation from their normal flight combat and military strategy games, Meier and Shelley began programming Civilization on an IBM PC in 1990. This began soon after MicroProse cancelled the sequel to  Railroad Tycoon. Meier personally handled all the programming and coding and all of the art for early incarnations of the game. The game became an all-consuming project, and Meier kept a notepad near his bed in case of sudden inspiration.[CR]Development occurred in cycles. Meier would develop a functioning prototype, hand it over to Shelley and they would dissect it until Meier went back to programming. The partners were the only ones involved in the early design process, with Meier unwilling to involve any other people until he was ready.[CR]An early incarnation of the game drew heavily from the duo's work on Railroad Tycoon and was equally inspired by SimCity. It was originally real-time based on zoning: players would choose areas for specific purposes and watch as their civilization slowly grew.[CR]At this moment in time, development was halted. Stealey, a former pilot, had developed MicroProse on the strength of flight simulators, and had little interest in other games. He was not particularly happy with the release of Railroad Tycoon, and Civilization would never had gotten so far if it were not for the previous game's success. Meier's status as a contractor, as opposed to employee, allowed the development of Civilization to continue. However, Stealey stepped in and refused to back the game, unless Meier and Shelley finished Covert Action, a action spy game that was set aside in favor of Railroad Tycoon.[CR]After Covert Action was finished, the team went back to Civilization where it saw the addition of its most important elements. First, the team incorporated turn based play. Zoning was abandoned and military strategy was added. Individual units were added that could be manipulated to various tasks. Meier also included the technology progression tree. During this time, little historic research was used. Instead Meier used popular conventions in how the public understood history, and incorporated these elements into his technology tree. With these additions to Civilization, the game was ready to leave the hands of Meier and Shelley.[CR]Due to the low priority of Meier's games at MicroProse, they had trouble securing the help they needed. It was only grudgingly that the company allowed the art team and play testing team to work on it.[CR]During this phase of development, the map was halved in size, large portions of the technology tree were removed, and units were removed. Prior to shipping however, Shelley developed the in-game reference guide, the Civilopedia, as well as the massive user manual.[CR]In 1991, the game shipped. It was late and saw very little promotion. However, on the strength of critical acclaim and word-of-mouth excitement, the game took the imagination of gamers everywhere and spawning a million selling franchise.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role as a ruler of a civilization and is challenged to build an empire amongst up to six other civilizations. The game begins at the end of the prehistoric era, 4000 BC, in a world without cities. The player starts with one or two Settler units to build his empire with. The cities that the player builds and micromanage will determine the success of the empire.[CR]In order to win the player is forced to explore the world, wage war and participate in diplomacy. The player must also decide where to build new cities, which city improvements or units to build, and which new advances in knowledge to take.[CR]As new knowledge is acquired, new units and improvements will be available to the player. Getting ahead in the technology race is a great advantage to the player.[CR]There are special city improvement in the game called Wonders of the World. They can only be built once in the world and gives an advantage to the civilization that builds it.[CR]The game is won when the player has destroyed all other civilizations, reached the end of the modern era (2100 AD) with the highest score or won the space race by reaching the star system of Alpha Centauri first.Civilizations[CR]Players can select amongst 14 historical civilizations to play. The difference between them is mostly cosmetic. The choice will determine titles, city names, musical heralds and color.RomanBabylonianGermanEgyptianAmericanGreekIndianRussianZuluFrenchAztecChineseEnglishMongol[CR]",

The levels consist of a collection of cogs, which can be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise to achieve this goal. There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks. Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn't start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.",

                "plot": "Sid Meier's Colonization is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition[CR]from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.[CR]The game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American[CR]Revolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your[CR]colonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.[CR]Each of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. [CR]The cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. [CR]You'll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. [CR]As you explore the land, you'll come across the Indian villages and some \"places of interest\" which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you'll find nothing, sometimes you'll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you'll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don't have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). [CR]To defend yourself from enemies, you'll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he'll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he's a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don't try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. [CR]As you progress in the game, you'll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce \"Liberty Bells\", which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you'll have to deal with the King's expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you've won!",

In both the latter screens the player must use their mouse to click where they wish Conan to travel to, making him walk to that location. The player may also access their stats screen or inventory at any point.[CR]Much of the game takes place in the hub city of Shadizar, and as the player travels around the world they can interact with NPCs by fighting, conversing, and in the case of merchants buying and selling items, or haggling with them for optimal deals. Quests can also be obtained from various NPCs, inns and priests can be used to heal, and temples can be used as a means to store items and money. The player is able to enter any empty building within the game to click on objects in hopes of looting them for items or money, however, the player's stealth stat is taken into account in these scenarios, and should they be caught, they will be arrested and lose all items and money in their possession. For exploring some areas of the world players may also need torches, rope, or similar items.A typical fight in Conan: The Cimmerian.[CR]While the player can choose to engage NPCs in combat, many enemies will automatically engage them when encountered. In combat scenarios the player can move from left to right and attack the opponent with one of three sword fighting techniques; chop, swing, or thrust. Initially the player only has the ability to use the swing technique, however, they can meet with sword trainers to learn the two other techniques and raise the stats of any technique. Each enemy is vulnerable to one of these and the player and their opponent must continually attack in real-time until one of their health bars is depleted. During fights, the game factors in the player's defence and damage stats, the power of their sword, and the stat specific to the sword technique they are using. If the player defeats a foe in combat they then have the ability to loot them.[CR]",

It is up to the two penguins to rearrange the blocks powering the time machine in order to avert the catastrophe.The gameplay is very reminiscent of Taito's Bubble Bobble and Parasol Stars: the penguins are respectively blue and green and move around single-screen levels defeating a variety of cute enemies which leave food and valuables behind when killed. The twist here is that the goal of each screen is not to clear every enemy, but rather to arrange four blocks bearing four distinct geometrical shapes in a specific pattern shown on the bottom of the screen, which changes for every level. The blocks are also the main weapon at the player's disposal, as they can be pushed into enemies to defeat them. Occasionally, a bonus may appear which gives the penguins a gunman hat and revolver, to make dispatching the baddies easier. The game presents a boss fight every few levels, ranging to farm animals to dragons. Aside from the tunes composed specifically for the game, the music also includes 16-bit remixes of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, coherently with the game's title and premise. In between the various seasons, the game offers a few entertaining cutscenes complete with slapstick comedy.",

It is a dialog-driven murder mystery, where the player controls Raoul Dusentier, a French police inspector invited on a private cruise by a wealthy businessman, only to find his host murdered upon arrival.[CR]The third and final of Delphine's adventure games, it featured many interface improvements over its predecessors, and also scenes with the detailed polygonal animation that the company became known for.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Raoul Dusentier, a police inspector in 1920s Paris, receives an invitation to attend a private cruise, hosted by wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan aboard his newly restored ship. Grabbing a chance at a vacation, Raoul readily accepts, and is ferried onto the vessel.[CR]He is immediately met by Hector, Karaboudjan's butler, who informs him that something terrible has happened to his master. Following Hector to Karaboudjan's office, he finds the businessman's body dead on the floor. But before he has an opportunity to investigate, the two are ambushed and knocked out. When they wake up again, a whole night has passed and the ship is now well out on the ocean. Even worse - the body has disappeared.[CR]With little to go on, Raoul now has a day to solve the mystery and finger the murderer, before the ship returns to the port.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Cruise for a Corpse is a mouse controlled point and click adventure. Based on the second version of Delphine's Cinematique engine, it featured an improved and streamlined interface, with a contextual menu of the available actions on the left mouse button, and the inventory on the right one.[CR]The goal of the game is to gather evidence as to the identity and motive of the murderer. While there are some regular adventure game puzzles in the game, Raoul's investigation is mainly done through dialog, where his knowledge is represented by a series of keywords he can pick from during conversations. Asking the right person about the right subject will gain him new information, unlocking another keyword. Additional keywords can also be gained by gathering physical clues or witnessing certain events.[CR]Progression through the game is symbolized with time, which will advance 10-45 minutes whenever Raoul discovers something of significance. The passing of time also causes changes in the game world, as characters will move around the ship and certain events or areas will only be available at specific times.[CR]When the clock reaches 6:30 PM, the captain will announce that the ship is about to land, and the inspector gathers the suspects to present his evidence. The player is then given choice of who to accuse, and a good or bad ending will play depending on whether the correct person was picked.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Raoul Dusentier - A French police inspector, and the protagonist of the story.[CR]Tom Logan - Karaboudjan's solicitor. Confident and ambitious, he may not be content with simply taking care of other's business.[CR]Rose Logan - Tom's wife. She puts on a happy face, but some say their marriage is doing poorly.[CR]Rebecca Karaboudjan - Karaboudjan's wife. A cold socialite, some think she's having an affair.[CR]Daphne Karaboudjan - Karaboudjan's daughter. Young and rebellious, she did not take well to her father arranging her betrothal.[CR]Julio Esperenza - Daphne's fianc\u00e9. A playboy from a rich Spanish family.[CR]Father Fabiani - A priest and friend of the family. There are murmurings he's being investigated by the church for inappropriate behavior.[CR]Suzanne Plum - A friend of Fabiani's. A fearless woman of integrity, or a loudmouth lush depending on who you ask.[CR]Dick Schmock - A recent addition to the family. Nobody seems to want to say much about him.[CR]Hector - Karaboudjan's butler. Unflinchingly loyal, but there may be things in his past he'd rather not discuss.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Curse of the Azure Bonds is the second game in the four-part series started with Pool of Radiance. It is part of SSI's Gold Box series of games based on TSR's 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons ruleset.[CR]The game is identical in play-style to its predecessor, although as with most iterations of the same formula, features significant changes:Improved graphicsPaladins and Rangers were added as playable classesThe \"Fix\" command was added to the Encamp option, speeding up (automating) the healing of injured characters as long as there was a cleric or paladin in the party capable of using healing spellsPlayers could import characters from Pool of Radiance, Hillsfar, or characters taken from this game who had adventured in Hillsfar.[CR]Players starting fresh with this game did not need a previous party to enjoy it. A pre-made party was available for them to use an new characters start out with an experience bonus to boost them up to the recommended minimum level required to survive the initial challenges.[CR]The game continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, it would become a tactical turn-based system with the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]The game continues the use of the translation wheel copy protection that Pool of Radiance had used. The player would occasionally be challenged by a set of Dwarven or Elvish runes onscreen and be required to use the codewheel to translate them and answer with the correct word. Losing the code wheel could render the game unplayable. The code wheel was seen by some as a cumbersome method of copy protection and would eventually be dropped from later installments of the series.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructionsAn Adventurer's Journal that went into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the gameA Quick Reference card for commandsThe copy protection translation wheel[CR]Additionally, Azure Bonds features an Overland travel system allowing characters to randomly run into encounters or explore cities and dungeons within the region that the adventure takes place in. Several towns and cities are reachable from the Overland map along with corresponding side-quests for extra experience and treasures. Even Phlan can be revisited, although not in the same extensive form as it was in Pool of Radiance.[CR]Certain dungeons and events are locked from exploration until the party completes another event first, but this expanded the scope of the party's travels greatly over that of Pool of Radiance.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Seeking adventure, the party's journeys take them to Tilverton. Unfortunately for these experienced heroes, they are suddenly attacked and overcome, captured, and when they awaken find that they have been bound with five glowing sigils on their sword arms. These Azure Bonds have cursed them into being puppets for whoever they are bonded to, allowing unseen masters to override their wills for when they require their services.[CR]Robbed of their items and gold, they try to discover just who is responsible in Tilverton, eventually finding some answers. However, they are forced against their will to attack the King's Carriage as it passes through the city and eventually seek the aid of the local Thieves Guild. Discovering that the Fire Knives' leader was one of those responsible for one of the bonds on their arms, they go off in search for their first clues.[CR]Over several adventures, the party discovers that a group of evil puppet masters, the New Alliance, are the ones responsible for the bonds on their arms. Each group intends to use the party towards their own evil ends and it is up to the party to stop them before that happens. After the Fire Knives, the party goes on to destroy the master of each bond after following further clues.[CR]They confront Dracandros, a rogue Red Wizard of Thay, who intends to use them to provoke a Flight of Dragons thus laying waste to everything in their path. Mogion, High Priestess of the dread god Moander, intends to use them to open a doorway that would release the god into this world. The Black Network of the Zhentarim intend to simply use the party to spread evil with their master, Fzoul Chembryl, pulling the strings.[CR]As they defeat each of these masters, their corresponding bonds disappear from the characters' arms. After all of these masters are defeated, the true leader of the New Alliance is revealed: Tyranthraxus, the demonic spirit that had escaped at the end of Pool of Radiance.[CR]Confronting Tyranthraxus at last within the ruins of the ancient city, Myth Drannor, the demon reveals his plans to take over their bodies through his own bond with them. After a tremendous battle, the party emerges victorious as they close the Pool of Radiance and destroy Tyranthraxus for the final time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Curse of the Azure Bonds is a follow-up adventure to Pool of Radiance, although experience with that game isn't necessary to enjoy this one. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use in this game with few changes outside of cosmetic fixes, the introduction of two new classes, and an entirely different campaign than that of its predecessor.[CR]The initial city, Tiverton, contains all of the essentials to help the party recover from their ambush. Even if the party is imported from Pool of Radiance or Hillsfar, they lose most of their equipment and gold as a result of the attack, a mechanic that has been used in other titles (such as a magical storm resulting in the loss of valuable equipment in Ultima VII: The Serpent Isle) in order to start the party out fresh for the challenges ahead without making it too easy.[CR]The most notable change is the introduction of an Overland option. The player could take their party out into the wilderness and explore certain locations comprising the southwest region of the Moonsea as their adventures will take them much further than one city. Various dungeons such as sewers, caverns, and wilderness locations all provide valuable opportunities to earn treasure and experience.[CR]All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 1st edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.Races[CR]Six races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world. Players can now select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.[CR]The races did not undergo any significant changes and had been presented in the same way as before in Pool of Radiance:Dwarves: Excellent warriors and often considered the best blacksmiths within the Forgotten Realms, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Gnomes: These are treated as shorter and slimmer versions of dwarves in the game, although they tend to be a little better as thieves.Halflings: Resistant to magic and poison, they are about half the size of humans and can make decent fighters and thieves.Human: The most common race in the Forgotten Realms, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.[CR]The alignment system remains unchanged from its previous implementation in Pool of Radiance:Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]As per 1st edition D&D rules, female characters were actually penalized in this game; their maximum strength score can never be as high as that of a male character. Race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]Two new classes were added to the game: the Paladin and the Ranger. These classes were previously unavailable in Pool of Radiance.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Paladins - These are holy fighters whose faith gives them resistances to spells and poison. They can also turn undead creatures as a cleric can at two levels below their current level. They have an aura that repels evil much like a Protection from Evil spell. They also gain the ability to Cure Disease once a week and can heal themselves of two points of damage per day. They can also use cleric spells when they reach 9th level. However, they must be Lawful Good and have more attribute restrictions than a fighter does.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield.[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.Locations[CR]With the introduction of the Overland map, the world of Azure Bonds is much larger than that of Pool of Radiance, introducing a series of new dungeons in a variety of settings consisting of more than city blocks. However, the cities and towns that are offered on this map are not as detailed as Phlan was in the previous game and often visiting one brings up only a menu listing the locations that can be visited.[CR]Most of the towns and cities on the Overland map have the following services:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an area[CR]Traveling across the Overland map along certain routes, such as between Voonlar and Yurash, can also confront the party with set encounters depending on certain factors.[CR]In addition to these, there are also a number of locations that are famous in regards to TSR's Forgotten Realms campaign setting that will be visited during the course of the adventure:Zhentil Keep - A city steeped in evil and darkness, one of the Bonds' masters dwells hereHillsfar Ruins - Visiting Hillsfar with the Zhentil Bond still active will make everyone unfriendly towards them as the city is at war with Zhentil Keep.Ruins of Myth Drannor - This ancient city was once the heart of a vast alliance of kingdoms and a shining example of unity, boasting expertise in the arts, magick, and forge. It fell to a massive alliance of evil intent on destroying this beacon of glory to the world and ever since then, has been the home to beasts and those hidden pieces of fantastic treasure that may still lie within. This is the final dungeon of the game and where the main enemy awaits the party.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]D/Generation's In-Game Title[CR]Designed and created by Robert Cook, D/Generation is an isometric action-adventure puzzle game that was released by Mindscape in 1991 for the DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST platforms, and was later ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1993. Set in the year 2021, D/Generation takes place in a futuristic setting with elements of cyberpunk and dystopian fiction, and the story follows the actions of a simple courier making an urgent delivery who finds himself entangled in the illicit corporate world of bioweapon research gone horribly awry. With the courier as their player character, players must climb ten floors of the Genoq Biolabs research building in search of the scientist Jean-Paul Derrida, the recipient of the package they carry. Malfunctioning security systems and hostile organic weapons (called Neogens) will impede their progress, while traumatized Genoq employees may be able to help the courier piece together what happened at the building prior to the player's arrival.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mere hours after receiving an urgent call in his Paris apartment, the protagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in Singapore via jet pack, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical research facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist Jean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and seal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his problems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. All lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and furthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have run amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant warnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the item in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips Genoq.Something is amiss within Genoq Biolabs.[CR]Over the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the courier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal bioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, which had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a front for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling biological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the company to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, and the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed D/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the building. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's corporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in order to prevent details of their activities from going public.[CR]Upon reaching the top floor, the courier discovers that it was not Derrida, but rather D/Generation that sent for him, and that the package he carried with him held a neurotransmitter which it needed in order to escape the building. Trapped within a hallucinatory realm conjured by his own creation, Derrida warns the courier that D/Generation must not be allowed to leave, as it was designed to be a genetically perfect killer that could blend in anywhere. Utilizing Derrida's advice, the courier is successful in luring D/Generation into a trap where it is killed by powerful microwaves. With moments to spare, he escapes the building, preventing the airstrike and saving the remaining employees trapped within the Genoq building.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected rooms (called \"scenes\" within the game), accomplishing various tasks within them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each level is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents a particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The game alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with many scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of things, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security systems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. Certain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of dangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue survivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely cleared of enemies.As the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.[CR]At the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to manipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into the game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other Trackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides with a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two examples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking before they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close doors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success in many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as other devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way as to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and pattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since tougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be performed quickly.[CR]The player's Laser sidearm is a good example of how D/Generation marries action and puzzle design elements. Its first and most obvious purpose is to kill the various hostile inhabitants of the Genoq building, however it's beams can activate switches, and will also ricochet, so it is usefully in many situations in which the player might wish to activate a switch from a distance, or cannot feasibly approach one due to a particular hazard. Even in combat situations when one is faced with forces that represent an immediate danger, it often behooves the player to be mindful of other objectives within the environment, as a stray volley could, for instance, kill a survivor, thus depriving the player of an additional life as well as potential exposition.[CR]Weapons & Items[CR]The arsenal of D/Generation, while not exceedingly deep, is decidedly tactical. Other than the Laser, which has unlimited uses, all items within the game are collected individually, with most being quite rare. With such limited quantities, this means that even using a single Grenade might have serious repercussions later on, like the inability to fight back against a deadly C/Generation. In general, it is a good idea to only use an item when presented the a situation which would be otherwise extremely difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.LaserLaser The first weapon found by the courier and the only one which has unlimited uses, the Laser is an invaluable tool not only for killing lesser Neogens like A/Generations and B/Generations, but also for solving various puzzles throughout the game that might require long-range switch activation.GrenadeGrenade The secondary weapon to the Laser's primary, the Grenade will be used by most players as the first line of defense against C/Generations, which are completely immune to laser weaponry. They are also able to disable Trackers, though it is rarely wise to use them in this way, since Trackers can usually be avoided or neutralized in other ways.BombBomb Use of the Bomb places a small, pulsating, red pyramidal device directly at the player's feet. After a few moments, it detonates, obliterating anything destructible in the immediate vicinity (including the player). This blast can even destroy doors, which grants a rare opportunity to access restricted zones without need of a key.ClockClock The Clock immediately slows down time for everything within the game world save the player, albeit for only a short period of time. When expecting heavy, hectic opposition, or when a particular puzzle might require an extremely fast execution of actions, the Clock can be invaluable.ShieldShield Upon use, the Shield seemingly causes the player to go out of focus. While the Shield is active, the player cannot be killed; the benefits of such a state should be readily apparent. Certain potent attacks such as Tracker grenades may destroy the Shield, but the player will not be killed as a result.Plasma BarrierPlasma Barrier The Plasma Barrier gives the player the ability to project a bouncing barrier similar to those created by Genoq's normal security system. It can be thought of as a hybrid of the Laser and the Grenade, as it has the ricocheting capability of the former combined with the destructive force of the latter.[CR]Neogens[CR]The products of Genoq's covert organic weapons research, the lethal Neogens have overrun Genoq Biolabs, permeating all levels of the building through use of ventilation shafts. In addition to the threat posed by the constructs themselves, oftentimes additional Neogens will spawn through vents, doing so indefinitely until said vents are closed by the player. Certain types seem mostly interested in the player (C/Generation), while others show no reservations in attacking survivors when given the opportunity (A/Generation).A/GenerationA/Generation Certainly one of the most numerous Neogens found throughout Genoq Biolabs, the A/Generation is a bouncing red sphere whose primary intended purpose was battlefield cleanup, though it has no qualms trying to \"clean\" the building's denizens, including the player. Their attack does not instantly kill, thus it is possible to break free of an A/Generation if a laser beam hits it after it begins absorbing the player.B/GenerationB/Generation The blue, cylindrical B/Generation is both faster and more deadly than its predecessor, the A/Generation. Purportedly capable of traveling in excess of seventy kilometers per hour, it subdues its target by simply crushing it from above, killing it instantaneously. While this compaction is quite handy in simplifying corpse disposal, it unfortunately means that their is no window of opportunity to survive the attack.C/GenerationC/Generation Of the more devious of Genoq's creations is the deceptive C/Generation, an organism that can mimic nearly anything, animate or inanimate. It will usually lie in wait for its victim, revealing its true form only when its hapless target is close enough to be attacked and decapitated. It is much more persistent than previously encountered Neogens, as evidenced by its propensity to follow the player between room.D/GenerationD/Generation The latest Neogen, the D/Generation prototype has no direct attacks per se, but does have the frightening ability to cause powerful, unshakable hallucinations, which render its victims powerless. It was built with certain safety precautions which would prevent it from ever leaving the Genoq facility of its own free will, but that has not stopped it from taking over the building's computer network and turning Genoq's creations against it.[CR]Security Measures[CR]Subverted by D/Generation's influence, the protective measures of Genoq Biolabs are a constant hindrance to the player. They at times can be overcome through sheer brute force, such as when using a Bomb to blow a path through a secured door, though more often than not players must simply be mindful of the threat they pose if they wish to survive their ordeal. In particular, players should always be on the lookout for keys, as they are the main means of progression on most floors.Security KeySecurity Key Littered throughout the Genoq facility are a multitude of Security Keys which grant differing levels of security clearance. There is a clear progression in most areas which leads players to find keys with successively higher clearance levels, though keys can sometimes be obtained out of order, or rendered unnecessary with a well-placed Bomb.Electrified PlateElectrified Plate / Land Mine Both Electrified Plates and Land Mines are stationary emplacements which do not present a threat unless a player attempts to walk over one. Electrified Plates will turn on and off intermittently, providing an opportunity to pass by, whereas Land Mines are constantly in an active state, and are only neutralized if triggered by something.TrackerTracker A troublesome presence throughout all ten levels of Genoq Biolabs, the Tracker is a sentry turret that will fire upon any human target directly in front of it. They come in two basic varieties: those that face a fixed position, and those that rotate in order to seek targets in all directions.Plasma BarrierPlasma Barrier The Plasma Barrier is a rebounding environmental hazard which typically bounces in a set pattern within a certain scene. They are capable of activating switches as well, so in some cases they represent active puzzle elements rather than mere passive obstructions.TeleporterTeleporter A Teleporter pad will transport a player or object instantaneously to another like pad in the immediate vicinity. Most types of player ordinance can be projected through a Teleporter, which is useful knowledge in cases when a Tracker or other danger awaits on the other side.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR]The game was released on the PC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST. It was announced for the Amstrad CPC, but that version was never released.  There were some differences depending on which console you played the game. These mainly consisted of player character choices, however the Spectrum version had fewer characters than the other releases.      Version Exclusive  Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST Playable Characters: Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Doctor, Companions: Ace or UNIT soldier  MS-DOS/PC Playable Characters: Second, Fourth or Seventh Doctor, Companions: Ace or UNIT soldier  ZX Spectrum Playable Character: Seventh Doctor, Companion: Ace Other characters you encounter during the game include K-9 (The Doctor's robot dog) and Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who is also the final end of level boss.  Some versions of the game featured special Daleks, such as hovering Daleks from the 1960s TV Century 21 comic strips, the Peter Cushing 'movie' Daleks and the special weapons Dalek from \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" (the TV serial).  Its relationship with the TV series canon is in dispute, however it has been attempted to fit in between the Virgin New Adventures novel \"Head Games\", which suggests the game takes place in an alternative universe created by the Doctor whilst he is affected by energy from the Land of Fiction. The PC and Amiga versions both contained a secret room, hidden behind some blocks during one of the levels. It mostly contained  programming credits for the game, in particular for graphics and music. The credits were hidden due to the BBC not wanting individual credits given for the development team, possibly due to their stance on Doctor Who at the time of release.  The game was designed and storyboarded by 221B Software Development, the PC, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST versions were developed and published by Alternative Software.  The ZX Spectrum version was released due to popular demand in 1993.  It had a different first level to other releases of the game - in older versions of the opening level, The Doctor had to travel through a sewer on a hoverboard.   It was also the last licensed Spectrum game due to it no longer being a commercially viable platform.   Although the game was released by Alternative Software, it was advertised as being released by Admiral Software. This was due to Alternative Software being a budget software label, and that wasn't the image they wanted for this game. It was soon recalled due to legal action from a software house already called Admiral Software. The game boxes had stickers placed over the logo, and the in-game graphics featuring the logo were replaced or removed.  Later, the game was re-released in the \"Sci-Fi Collection\" with two other title (Galactic Warrior Rats and Suburban Commando) for the PC. This was later re-released itself with a slightly different cover in 1995.  The game engine created for the game by 221B Software was later re-used as the basis for the Suburban Commando game. [CR]",

Only the lush and colourful background graphics with paralax scrolling were commended in some reviews.Dangerous Streets was the lead game in the bundle(called \"The Dangerous Streets Pack\") that the most people got their Amiga CD32 machine in. This was perhaps disadvantageous for the reputation of the CD32 due the low quality of the game. Dangerous Streets was also released in a bundle togheter with Wing Commander for Amiga CD32.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game offers three distinct game modes:Player vs. PlayerPlayer vs. CPUTournament: Here you can pick one of the 8 characters and fight through four different locations with 8 fighters and become the boss on the street.There are three game speed settings(slow, normal, fast) and three skill levels of the CPU opponents(easy, normal, hard) that can be set.Every of the 8 characters has at least three special moves. All special moves are mostly executed by the same joystick/gamepad button and exactly which move a character performs depends on the distance the character is away from his target/opponent. Also the controls for the fighters are different - push up on the joystick and one fighter will jump another will kick.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionSpecial MovesKeoA German-born devoutmonk who is working as acustodian in a castle.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Dark Queen of Krynn is the third, and final game, in a three volume series of titles set in AD&D's Dragonlance campaign setting developed by SSI using their Gold Box Engine. It was preceded by the first game in the series, Champions of Krynn (1990), and its immediate sequel, Death Knights of Krynn (1991). Prior experience with either two titles was not required, although veteran players may find it beneficial to import characters developed throughout the story arc.[CR]The game begins two years after the events in Death Knights of Krynn. The commander of the unified armies that had defeated the evil dragons in the War of the Lance, Laurana, has extended an invitation to the characters to join her in the city of Palanthas. She suspects that although the War has long been won, evil continues to fester in hidden pockets throughout the land and requests your help in dealing with them once and for all.[CR]It is part of SSI's Gold Box series of games based on TSR's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset and set in the Forgotten Realms. It continues to the use the Gold Box engine first pioneered with Pool of Radiance and then enhanced for use across those games that had followed it such as Gateway to the Savage Frontier or Champions of Krynn. Because it is relatively based on the same engine behind SSI's Gold Box series of RPGs. only the setting has changed.[CR]The game, based as it is on the Gold Box engine, continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, a tactical turn-based system was used to display the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]Upon starting, a verification question is shown which directed the player to find the indicated word answer in either the rule book (the manual) or the included Adventurer's Journal. The disks themselves did not have any copy protection allowing players to make copies and play on them instead.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructions and an outline of the rulesAn Adventurer's Journal going into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the game; it would also double as an additional layer of copy protection as it contained the scene description references for the game.A Quick Reference card for commands[CR]Characters could be transferred from the previous game, Death Knights of Krynn (but not Champions of Krynn).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The party of heroes arrive in Palanthas after receiving the invitation from General Laurana who asks for their help in investigating several reports of evil having round a new foothold within the region. The party are sent to the city of Caergoth only to discover that most of it has been demolished with most of its citizens missing or slain in the battle that had crushed it.[CR]In searching through the city, they encounter draconian patrols that they must fight through and eventually run across Captain Daenor who had lost his sister there. He explains what had happened and asks for their help in searching for the draconians responsible. Eventually, whlie journeying on the Silver shark, they discover a shipwreck on a nearby beach. They explore it and follow tracks leading up the overlooking cliff face and find a cave filled with a horde of draconian soldiers.[CR]The hostages that they had taken from Caergoth are also there along with Crysia, Daenor's sister, who is under a charm spell and aids the enemy. She warns the horde of their approach and pits them against several battles throughout the tunnels as they follow her deeper into the caves. After freeing the prisoners and speaking with the Mayor of Caergoth, they eventually find another way out from the caves and witness Crysia escape atop a blue dragon.[CR]They return to the Silver Shark, but the ship meets misfortune on the waves, sending the characters into the water. The Dargonesti elves from the underwater city of Naulidis rescue and enchant them with spells allowing them to breathe underwater. As they get used to their lives under the sea in Naulidis, sea dragons attack prompting an evacuation of the city. They also rescue Captain Daenor who tells them that sahuagin are holding sea dragon eggs hostage, forcing their parents to fight for them.[CR]The party head to the ruins of Celanost nearby where the eggs are secretly kept and rescue them from the mercenaries and the monsters conjured to protect them. The eggs are returned and the sea dragons agree to end their attack and unite against the treacherous sahuagin. They find the sahuagin leader, Prince Talhook, as he prepares to assassinate Prince Lyzian of Naudilis. Thankful for their help, the sea elves bring the party to the continent of Taladas.[CR]In the Hamlet of Hizden, the party awaken in an inn and the party speaks to Ezra as Lyzian has suggested. They are told about the Luminari lighthouse and a wizard that may be able to assist. But before they are able to explore this lead, the sahuagin attack once again in revenge. After defeating them, they head to the lighthouse.[CR]There, the wizard Fastillion gives them valuable information along with two keys to the inner chambers of the tombs below. Unfortunately, before they meet him, they discover evidence of his insanity as he has filled his home with many tricks and traps, most of which he has already forgotten about. However, in exploring the tower, they discover a woman of the Hulderfolk who had been crushed by a gorgon before she had turned it to stone. As she dies, she tells them how to reach Fastillion.[CR]Upon reaching him, he proves to be a valuable source of information and informs them that they must seek the Oracle of Tengur in the tombs of the old city of Kristophan. He gives them the keys and the party set off for the Capitol of the League.[CR]Kristophan is filled with both humans and minotaurs, but it is clear that the minotaurs hold absolute power within the League. Upon exploring the city, they hear about the disappearance of a tome known only as the Book of Amrocar. There are many other adventures within Kristophan that the party takes part in, but eventually, they must find the Oracle. They also find a thief named Selias who helps them to reach the tombs that they must explore.[CR]Within the tombs, the party run across many undead encounters that threaten to destroy them. A secret circus of the undead is also found within its walls including many puzzles and deadly traps. The party also discover that the Oracle has been broken apart into many scattered pieces, each one of which must be found and whose trail seems to lead ever deeper into the tunnels and towards a lair of powerful vampires.[CR]With the Oracle assembled, the party follow a lead to the Hulderfolk Wood where they quickly become lost unless they can recite the ancient words of frienship. They also run across Tasselhoff Burrfoot, one of the Heroes of the Lance, who is just as lost as they are. Together, they manage to overcome the enchanted forest's defenses and are brought before the Hulder King and Queen for a banquet. However, they discover that the spiteful Queen's magic has allowed a month to pass in the outside world while the party was trapped within the Wood. But they have also gained a powerful artifact that will prove useful later: the Iron Dragon Scale.[CR]They resume their quest by following another lead to more draconian activity within the city of New Aurim, the captal of the Thenol Empire. They find that the Thenolians are preparing for war and that the draconians are within the King's palace. They decide to join the army as part of their cover and are given uniforms, allowing them to pass freely throughout the city and infiltrate the palace.[CR]Now disguised, they search the palace for more information concerning the draconians, discovering that the barracks are filled with them. The draconians plan to use the Thenolian army as a tool in gathering more dragon eggs. Still believing that they are a part of the military, the party is then asked to escort a group of draconians to Hawkbluff. But Thenolian rebels attack and kill the draconians instead. The party then penetrate even deeper into the palace which now appears to have been largely abandoned to monsters.[CR]Within the inner palace, the King who now acts as a mere puppet to of the Tyrant Trandamere is all but useless to them. But the Queen shares what she can of their plans. They also meet Grunschka, a dwarf, who aids them against the draconian infiltration. They descent into the bowels of the palace where they manage to disrupt the ritual of corruption over a massive number of dragon eggs, stopping it before more draconians can hatch and ruining the plans of evil in the process.[CR]The party then follow the clues to Hawkbluff where Tyrant Trandamere, the real power behind the Thenol Empire, awaits with his own army. Gates requiring specific passes fill the hallways but a friendly jeweler in the town outside of the fortress helps them in forging the required items. Within Hawkbluff, the party discover that a temple to Hith had been constructed within its walls and that its architect, Davik, has been imprisoned. However, after freeing him and with his help, they escape through the temple after taking back the Book of Amrocar from the Tyrant who flees.[CR]The party discover that they must go to the village of Bai'or where they find that it has been converted into a shipyard for the navy that will transport the draconian armies assembling on Taladas across to Ansalon. The \"sharkmen\" that run the village are actually in the employ of the draconians, but as they are not trustworthy, several dragons have also been put into place to ensure their loyalty.[CR]After many battles and in aiding the villagers against the sharkmen, the party defeat the dragons and discover one of their number that is different. Deformed and corrupted, she tells the party her story as a failed creation at making a dragon host powerful enough to act as a means for Erestem, otherwise known as Takhisis in Ansalon, to enter the world. If the party helps her recover from her wounds, she tells them to head to Blackwater Glade and seek the othlorx dragons there.[CR]In Blackwater Glade, they give the Iron Dragon Scale that they had earned from the Hulderfolk to Tremor, the red othlorx dragon, whose lair they discover the entrance to with the Book of Amrocar. They also meet a wandering bard named Baldric who is really the silver dragon, Baldranous. Although he appears cowardly, he is actually assessing the party's battle prowess from a distance. If the party is patient with him and keep him in the party, they will also get a reward. Eventually, they learn that the draconians are camped by the Lava Sea and the silver dragons fly the party to the citadel at Aldinanachru.[CR]There, they find that the gnomish citadel is in chaos. The king has decided that all social classes must be thrown out and that every worker must now exchange their position with someone else, throwing everything into disarray. Eventually, the party reveals that the King is actually a draconian and that his plan was enacted in order to ensure that the forces of good would not be able to use the gnomes' firefleets and windships.[CR]Once the true king is found and restored to his throne, the party heads to the Tower of Flame to defeat the evil forces gathering there and stop the Dark Queen. At the victory celebration following the King's proper restoration, red othlorx dragons led by Tremor attack, but the party manage to defeat them.[CR]At the Tower, the party riding a gnome windship leap through a siege port within its walls and find themselves at the highest level of the structure. However, Crysia re-appears as their friend, Captain Draenor, leads them across a flimsy bridge. Crysia severs the bridge and the party fall into an air shaft, losing contact with the Captain. The party must now fight their way up from the bottom of the structure in order to stop Takhisis' return.[CR]They smash through the Tower engines, crippling its defenses, and then defeat beholders protecting the siege ports. Opening these, the gnomish forces waiting outside storm the Tower. As the party makes their way upwards, they also encounter a coven of black wizards healing the wounded dragons that arrive, and then defeat them causing many others to begin fleeing for their lives. At a temple, they also find and defeat draconians that have gathered together to celebrate what they believe to be the impending return of their Queen.[CR]Once they have penetrated the core of the Tower, they are drawn into the Abyss itself by a whispering man who turns out to be the infamous, Black Robed mage and former Hero of the Lance, Raistlin Majere. They free him and he tells of Takhisis' plans to enter Krynn, but also tells them of how to stop her before it is too late. As they sneak past the Queen who is engaged in a complex ritual, they distract her by hurling a rock at a nearby bell. The plan succeeds, but only the party is able to escape. Behind them, Raistlin and the Queen fight each other.[CR]The party find themselves back in the Tower where a five-headed, chromatic dragon who is to be Takhisis' vessel, awaits them. It is also at the Tower that they discover that the Grathanich, the grey stone created by the god, Reorx, and whose power had shaped the gnomes, dwarves, and kender with its life-changing powers, is also there and had been used as a powerful tool in creating the five-headed dragon. Once killing it, it frees itself from beneath the egg that it had come from and the party pursue it as it floats throughout the Tower.[CR]However, at the top and with beings of every side pursuing it, the stone eventually falls down a shaft and is forever lost. The party escape the Tower onboard a gnomish airship to the gnomish citadel where they are finally hailed as heroes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Dark Queen of Krynn is the third and final game in the Dragonlance series of SSI's Gold Box titles. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use in this campaign series with few changes. All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 2nd edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.[CR]Players begin The Dark Queen of Krynn by creating a party of six heroes. The parameters used in creating each character include race, class, affiliation & alignment as well as the likeness of the icon that will appear in combat. These factors will dictate what sorts of weapons & armor your characters can use, if they use magic & what kind of spells they can learn.[CR]After creating the type of character, players can determine the value of a series of attributes that he or she will begin the game with. Players can roll and re-roll their statistics until satisfied with the levels of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Hit Points, Armor Class and Experience Points. Players' approach to the game will depend on the mix of characters to be added to your party.[CR]Once the party is assembled, gameplay consists of taking assignments from the commandants of Knight outposts and NPCs in the towns which you visit as well as encounters you have while traveling between locations on the overworld map. Combat is turn based and includes character movement which impacts tactical decisions such as ranged vs melee attacks, deployment of party members and order of targeting. Successful battles will result in the party earning XP & currency as well as looting items and weapons from your fallen enemies.Races[CR]With the introduction of the Gold Box series as a part of the Dragonlance campaign series with this title, seven races are now available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character. Before, in the series based on the Forgotten Realms setting, only six races were available.[CR]Players can also select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.Mountain Dwarves: Excellent warriors, expert craftsmen, and strong workers, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. Their hate for goblins and hobgoblins also gives them bonuses in battle against their kind. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Hill Dwarves: They are just as stubborn and as tough as Mountain Dwarves although not as charmismatic.Qualinesti Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others. They are also much friendlier than their Silvanesti cousins.Silvanesti Elves: They are just like the Qualinesti, although are typically more arrogant.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Human: The most common race on Ansalon, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Kender: They are a diminutive people who bear an extreme curiosity often \"misinterpreted\" by others as thievery. They are very resistant to magic and poison and can easily taunt others with a silver tongue often making their opponents go into an uncontrollable rage. Their dexterity adds to their accuracy with their weapon of choice, the hoopak, or in picking a few locks to satisfy their inquisitive nature.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities as defined by the 2ed AD&D rules that the game is based on.[CR]These determine factors such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Solamnic Knights - They are the pinnacle of chivalric honor on Krynn and are divided into three orders: the Knights of the Crown, the Knights of the Sword, and the illustrious Knights of the Rose. They start out with plate mail, a long sword, and a shield, but with very few coins to spend. In addition to this vow of poverty, 10% of their monies are sent back to the order every time an outpost is visited. When Knights of the Sword or Rose rise to sixth level, they are able to use some clerical spells.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it. Clerics can only be of an alignment the same as that of their chosen god.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield. On Ansalon, their spells are also affected by the wax and wane of its moons. As with Knights, mages are also split into three orders based on alignment with their own strengths, abilities, and favored moon.White Robes - good aligned mages belong to this orderRed Robes - those of a neutral persuasion belong to this orderBlack Robes - evil mages are often members of this order; cannot be PC characters in this gamePaladin - A warrior class able to use most weapons and armor, they must be of Lawful Good alignment, can cast Cure Disease once a week, and at ninth level gain the ability to cast clerical spells. They also have the ability to turn undead, particularly useful in this chapter of SSI's Dragonlance saga, as if they were a cleric at two levels below their actual level. Introduced to the series in Death Knights of Krynn.[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.The Moons of Magic[CR]The three moons of Krynn figure prominently within the game's magic system depending on their phases: Solinari (the white moon), Lunitari (the red moon), Nuitari (the black moon). Their phases are displayed onscreen as a part of the interface.[CR]Mages of the White Robes, for example, gain their power from the white moon, Solinari, and gain two additional memorized spells as a result of it being a full moon.Locations[CR]Many towns have the same locations within them, offering a variety of services:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an areaBank - Maintained by the Solamnic Order, deposits of money (not equipment) can be made at each branch in allotments of 100 pieces at a time. A fee is also charged for the service.Overland[CR]Overland travel was displayed when the party left a civilized area such as a town or an outpost. Cursor keys allowed the player to maneuver them across this map and the Area command could toggle the view between the 3D first-person look or back to the overland view depending on availability. Random encounters would often make travel dangerous, but unavoidable. Likewise, travelers encountered on the road may offer their help with certain services.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.[CR]",

The game heavily uses artwork by  H.R. Giger, famously known for his design of the  Alien from the  Alien Franchise. The game features the normal world and a dark world counterpart. It was one of the first adventure games to use high-resolution graphics (640 pixels wide) to the demand of H.R. Giger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the game, players control  Mike Dawson (named after the game's lead designer), an ad company manager who hates his job and pursues his goal in life to become a writer. Mike Dawson purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise Mike's suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and he decides to buy the house. Upon reaching the house, Mike suddenly feels tired and finds a bed, proceeding to fall asleep, only to find himself in a nightmare, unable to wake up.[CR]The nightmare seems to create a version of his life and has turned it into a world of terror. An unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in Mike's mind, and he only has three days to find a way to stop it.[CR]Ports[CR]The game was released for the  Amiga,  Amiga CD32,  PC (Dos),  Macintosh,  Sega Saturn and  PlayStation. Both the console versions, the Sega Saturn and PlayStation ports, were only released in Japan, with the Saturn version being compatible with the Sega Saturn Mouse. There was also a version developed for the Sega Mega-CD and was even promoted for American release, but publisher  Vic Tokai never released it. An unlicensed version was released for the  Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Chinese.[CR]Unlike most adventure games at the time, which give the player time to explore the environment, almost every action in Dark Seed has to fall within precise time limits, or the game will end up being in an unwinnable state. Due to the game frequently crashing, the player would often have to start over to win without resorting to a walk through for the game.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Soon after the game was released, there was an urban legend that spread around that because of the intense pressure of designing Dark Seed, the game's lead designer,  Mike Dawson, had a mental breakdown. In actuality, Mike Dawson left the games industry after completing Dark Seed and moved into writing for television until the late 1990's before writing two books on programming (Beginning C Game Programming and Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner) and teaching game design and programming classes at Stanford University and UCLA.[CR]",

It would be followed by The Dark Queen of Krynn (1992) and was preceded by Champions of Krynn (1990).[CR]The game begins a year following the events of Champions of Krynn. The player controls a party of adventurers who are typically the same heroes that had put down the forces of evil in the previous game. They are invited to Gargath Outpost to celebrate their victory when the game begins.[CR]It is part of SSI's Gold Box series of games based on TSR's 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules and set in the Forgotten Realms. It continues to the use the Gold Box engine first pioneered with Pool of Radiance and then enhanced for use in this series with Gateway to the Savage Frontier. Because it is based on the same engine behind SSI's Gold Box series of RPGs. only the setting has changed.[CR]The game, based as it is on the Gold Box engine, continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, a tactical turn-based system was used to display the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]Upon starting, a verification question is shown which directed the player to find the indicated word answer in either the rule book (the manual) or the included Adventurer's Journal. The disks themselves did not have any copy protection allowing players to make copies and play on them instead.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructions and an outline of the rulesAn Adventurer's Journal going into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the game; it would also double as an additional layer of copy protection as it contained the scene description references for the game. It would also recount a summary of the War of the Lance leading up to the events in the post-war environment of Ansalon and where the party steps in to help solve a mysteryA Quick Reference card for commands[CR]Characters could be transferred from the previous game, Champions of Krynn. However, if they are transferred in before completing that game, they may lose some items as a result.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Peace has arrived on Ansalon in the year following the defeat of the forces of darkness in Champions of Krynn. With the aurak draconian Myrtani's defeat, so ended his plans to destroy the armies of the forces of good that had rallied to stop him not knowing that they were walking into a trap. Had it not been for the efforts of a group of daring adventurers aided by heroes such as Sir Karl of the Solamnic Knights, all would have been lost.[CR]An invitation is soon sent out to celebrate this event a year later, at the Gargath Outpost, and as everyone gathers, Sir Karl attacks! He had died in the previous adventure, a victim of Myrtani's minions, and has apparently become an undead knight atop an equally undead dragon. He steals the Dragonlance, a powerful weapon against dragons, from its display and leaves behind a pile of cursed weapons in its place. Maya, his former lover and a silver dragon in human form, transforms herself to take flight after his retreating form.[CR]Those that have dared to take the cursed weapons left behind by Sir Karl, perhaps thinking to fight him, have also become corrupted as a result and the party will encounter them throughout the adventure. Only by taking these weapons away do these people return to their senses.[CR]In the wake of the attack, everyone retreats back to Gargath Outpost as more evil forces arrive. Besieged, the party battles their way through many challenges within its walls. They also encounter an old knight that claims to have seen this battle in his dreams and gives them a Sleepstone in which it was captured. He tells them to seek the Dream Merchant in Kalaman in order to discern its secrets as well as find meaning behind these events.[CR]After breaking the siege, the party heads to Kalaman as instructed and meet the local Knight Commander, Daine, and his consort, Ariela. Daine tells them the worst: he suspects that the undead were summoned by none other than Lord Soth, a powerful and legendary Death Knight. As they talk with the Commander, they also hear of an account on the search for the cleric, Sebas Astmoor, who appears to be helping the dread knight. Ariela also lets it slip that the Dream Merchant they seek has a shop in Vingaard, but they also discover too late that he has been kidnapped.[CR]The party receives an invitation to parlay for the Dream Merchant's release but during the meeting, Lord Sorth's minions attack. In the chaos, the Dream Merchant escapes leaving the party to fight their way free. After they succeed, they track the Merchant to Vingaard Keep's Crook Street. They discover the Dream Merchant and whether or not they had broken the truce between themselves and the kidnappers in Kalaman, will either test them first with several dream battles or simply decide to help them.[CR]The interpretation that the Dream Merchant gives them indicates that the cleric. Sebas Astmoor, has renounced his ties to Soth and may be the party's best means of defeating the Death Knight. They quickly seek him out and find him. He reveals that he is trying to find a party powerful enough to hold the Rod of Omniscience. The artifact, if left in the wrong hands, could allow the dark goddess Takhisis to lay waste to all of Krynn. But in order to trust the party with the Rod's location, he first tests them.[CR]He sends the party on a quest to defend the crypts there from Lord Soth who intends to raise the dead there into an undead army. They arrive at the tower only to discover that Lord Soth has already begun his work and are faced with many undead that they are forced to fight through. They meet an old knight, Sir Durfey, who joins their party after they help him.[CR]But they discover that they are too late to stop Lord Soth and his party. The bodies of many Knights, including that of the famous Hero of the Lance, Sturm Brightblade, have already been taken. They pursue the thieves into the tunnels below and learn that the forces that had attacked the tower were led by Sir Garren, a knight that had been cursed with one of the weapons that Sir Karl had left behind at Gargath. They chase the undead army and defeat the red dragon with them, narrowly managing to rescue Sir Garren from his curse and recover many of the bodies.[CR]Unfortunatey, Lord Soth has escaped with several of the others along with Sturm Brightblade's, bodies he intends to convert into new Death Knights. With enough of these at his command, he intends to crush his enemies once and for all and may succeed with such power at his disposal.[CR]The party returns to Vingaard with the news and Sebas sends them to the Dragon Pit to deal with Sir Karl as a further test. The Dragon Pit is an ancient temple to the dark goddess, Takhisis, and Sebas' suspicions that Sir Karl is still there prove to be true. They also encounter Maya who has also followed the clues to find her beloved. However, the reunion is washed in blood as Sir Karl ambushes her with the Dragonlance. Wounded deeply with the weapon, she takes to the skies with the Dragonlance still driven into her, Sir Karl hanging onto it as the two disappear into the clouds. A moment later, the Dragonlance falls to the ground.[CR]They return to Vingaard and find that Sebas has been abducted with clues pointing to Kalaman and Ariela. At Kalaman, they contact Sir Daine who is mercilessly killed when he confronts Ariela. The party confront her and are stunned to watch her transform into a red dragon aided by sivak draconians. Upon defeating her, they discover that she had been sent by Kitiara, the consort of Lord Soth. The party also manages to rescue a knight to whom Sebas revealed the location of the Rod to as being somewhere in the Voice Wood.[CR]They discover more clues in Kalaman indicating that Ariela often visited a town called Cerberus and in going there, discover that the mayor has been assassinated. Attending the funeral, the graveyard around them explodes with undead rising from their tombs and graves. The mystic wards that had protected it were stolen by a gravedigger corrupted by Lord Soth and the party manages to recover them, restoring their power.[CR]Ariela also had a key on her that the party discovers will open a way into Dargaard Keep, the home of Lord Soth. They meet with Lenore, a thief who is looking for her own fortune, who helps them avoid several traps before leaving their company. Sir Durfey offers to escort her home and the two leave the party.[CR]They return to Cerberus and find the town under attack by more undead. The fortune teller in the town, however, is in league with Lord Soth and is leading the attack. The town's cleric is captured by the fortune teller which complicates matters as they were the only one able to open the town's armory. They rescue the cleric and slay the fortune teller, allowing the town to arm themselves and defeat the undead.[CR]The party then heads to Voice Wood to recover the Rod of Omniscience but before they can reach it, they must pass through the town of Dulcimer. The town is a mirror image of Cerberus created by a powerful lich based on his memories. He does not wish to fight the party, but has sworn to Lord Soth not to let anyone through. With no other choice, the party is forced to destroy the lich and the anchor for his soul, his phylactery, allowing them to pass into the Voice Wood.[CR]They discover that the Voice Wood is a faerie glen and, thus, one of the few places where good still reigns so near to Dargaard Keep. They parlay with the spirits of the wood and convince them to release the rod into their care.[CR]With the Rod, the party head into the keep and reunite with Sebas Astmoor, rescue Sturm's body, and discover that Lenore has returned to help them. But they also discover that Sir Durfey, her escort, did not survive and returns as an undead knight. After defeating him, they confront Lord Soth and strike him with the Rod of Omniscience, banishing him to another dimension.[CR]Lenore suddenly reveals herself to be Kitiara and tries to steal back the rod in order to send the party into another dimension as well. However, Sebas had given her false instructions on how to use the device. The Rod is destroyed as a result as Kitiara is sent to another dimension herself and the party is teleported to the High Clerist's tower.[CR]The battle is won with the party hailed as heroes, but as they will discover in the next chapter, the war has only begun.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Death Knights of Krynn is the second game in the Dragonlance series of SSI's Gold Box titles. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use in this campaign series with few changes. All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 2nd edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.[CR]Players begin Death Knights of Krynn by creating a party of six heroes. The parameters used in creating each character include race, class, affiliation & alignment as well as the likeness of the icon that will appear in combat. These factors will dictate what sorts of weapons & armor your characters can use, if they use magic & what kind of spells they can learn.[CR]After creating the type of character, players can determine the value of a series of attributes that he or she will begin the game with. Players can roll and re-roll their statistics until satisfied with the levels of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Hit Points, Armor Class and Experience Points. Players' approach to the game will depend on the mix of characters to be added to your party.[CR]Once the party is assembled, gameplay consists of taking assignments from the commandants of Knight outposts and NPCs in the towns which you visit as well as encounters you have while traveling between locations on the overworld map. Combat is turn based and includes character movement which impacts tactical decisions such as ranged vs melee attacks, deployment of party members and order of targeting. Successful battles will result in the party earning XP & currency as well as looting items and weapons from your fallen enemies.Races[CR]With the introduction of the Gold Box series as a part of the Dragonlance campaign series with this title, seven races are now available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character. Before, in the series based on the Forgotten Realms setting, only six races were available.[CR]Players can also select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.Mountain Dwarves: Excellent warriors, expert craftsmen, and strong workers, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. Their hate for goblins and hobgoblins also gives them bonuses in battle against their kind. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Hill Dwarves: They are just as stubborn and as tough as Mountain Dwarves although not as charmismatic.Qualinesti Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others. They are also much friendlier than their Silvanesti cousins.Silvanesti Elves: They are just like the Qualinesti, although are typically more arrogant.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Human: The most common race on Ansalon, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Kender: They are a diminutive people who bear an extreme curiosity often \"misinterpreted\" by others as thievery. They are very resistant to magic and poison and can easily taunt others with a silver tongue often making their opponents go into an uncontrollable rage. Their dexterity adds to their accuracy with their weapon of choice, the hoopak, or in picking a few locks to satisfy their inquisitive nature.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities as defined by the 2ed AD&D rules that the game is based on.[CR]These determine factors such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Solamnic Knights - They are the pinnacle of chivalric honor on Krynn and are divided into three orders: the Knights of the Crown, the Knights of the Sword, and the illustrious Knights of the Rose. They start out with plate mail, a long sword, and a shield, but with very few coins to spend. In addition to this vow of poverty, 10% of their monies are sent back to the order every time an outpost is visited. When Knights of the Sword or Rose rise to sixth level, they are able to use some clerical spells.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it. Clerics can only be of an alignment the same as that of their chosen god.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield. On Ansalon, their spells are also affected by the wax and wane of its moons. As with Knights, mages are also split into three orders based on alignment with their own strengths, abilities, and favored moon.White Robes - good aligned mages belong to this orderRed Robes - those of a neutral persuasion belong to this orderBlack Robes - evil mages are often members of this order; cannot be PC characters in this gamePaladin - A new addition to the series. Although the role of Solamnic Knight had assumed its place in the roster in the previous game ( Champions of Krynn), it makes a return as a playable class here. They must be of Lawful Good alignment, can cast Cure Disease once a week, and at ninth level gain the ability to cast clerical spells. They also have the ability to turn undead, particularly useful in this chapter of SSI's Dragonlance saga, as if they were a cleric at two levels below their actual level.[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.The Moons of Magic[CR]The three moons of Krynn figure prominently within the game's magic system depending on their phases: Solinari (the white moon), Lunitari (the red moon), Nuitari (the black moon). Their phases are displayed onscreen as a part of the interface.[CR]Mages of the White Robes, for example, gain their power from the white moon, Solinari, and gain two additional memorized spells as a result of it being a full moon.Locations[CR]Many towns have the same locations within them, offering a variety of services:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an areaVault - Maintained by the Solamnic Order, deposits of money (not equipment) can be made at each branch in allotments of 100 pieces at a time. A fee is also charged for teh service.Commandant's Office - Where the party goes to receive mission briefingsOverland[CR]Overland travel was displayed when the party left a civilized area such as a town or an outpost. Cursor keys allowed the player to maneuver them across this map and the Area command could toggle the view between the 3D first-person look or back to the overland view depending on availability. Random encounters would often make travel dangerous, but unavoidable. Likewise, travelers encountered on the road may offer their help with certain services.[CR]Proximity to certain areas on the map will generate specific encounter groups based on the makeup of the region. For example, moving further east into dangerous lands will spawn encounters with hill giants, great spiders, and draconians.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.[CR]",

Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.[CR]In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set).

The blade is cursed, so if you don't feed its bloodlust often enough it will begin to go out of control, stabbing in random directions, with the ultimate result of it flying out of your hands and embedding itself in your chest.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Players progress through open levels where you can move to the right or left, and at the end of those areas you either reach another side-scrolling level or a boss-like screen which has a huge, animated monster or monsters which must be defeated or bypassed, usually with multiple places to hit.  Players can stab diagonally up or down, as well as straight ahead, as well as run and jump.   Monsters include goblins, hostile wildlife, and fire-breathing dragon babies, while the bosses include a huge dragon (maybe the mama), a trio of giants, and a gnarled rock monster. All of this sounds promising, but where the formula breaks down is in the gameplay execution.  With the rage meter for the sword, and player character's own meager health, the game can be very lethal.  Usually running past enemies is the best way to get through a level, but when you're hit, not only do you take damage, but you also get knocked back.  Without the temporary invincibility flicker that you get in other such games, this means that if you hit a series of enemies, you could get bounced back repeatedly with no control over your character until he's about dead.  The music, while fun, is unrelenting, and there are no sound effects.  The opening scroll that tells you the story of the game is pretty hilarious, but it's probably the most disappointing thing about the game because it seems to promise a better game than you actually get. The crushing difficulty, combined with the sluggish controls, make this more as an example of the possibility for brilliant graphics, character design, opening narration, and animation for the time period, at least.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A siege on an enemy castle.[CR]Defender of the Crown is a Strategy game set in Medieval England. The player takes control over a young Saxon man (either Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword or Wolfric the Wild) wishing to become the King of England after the previous King (King Richard) is murdered by a Norman traitor, and the crown has been stolen. After being recruited by Robin Hood to fight for the good of the country, the player starts out with only one castle and ten soldiers and must build up his force to take back the crown and avenge the king's death by fighting against several Norman factions.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay revolves around a Risk-style board of England in which players defend their territories from the Norman Factions, and partake in ruthless conquest in a bid to take over their territories. Amassing larger bands of troops increases the players chances of success. Many territories contain enemy castles. Upon launching an attack on a castled territory, the player must lay siege to the enemy castle by firing boulders at the castle wall from a catapult. The player can also decide to raid enemy castles for loot, which he can then use to strengthen his forces.[CR]In addition to this primary gameplay, several side-missions exist, including:A Jousting Match.Rescuing captured princesses: The player will occasionally receive a message from a damsel in distress, asking to be rescued from an enemy castle. The player must raid the enemy castle, sword-fighting towards the princess at the top of the castle. Upon the successful rescue of the princess, the player's character will marry the princess. There is a brief scene in which the shadowy figures of the character and the princess are seen seductively approaching each other, and their shadows are seen passionately kissing.Jousting matches: Occasionally invitations to rival factions tournaments will be received, in which the character must engage their rivals in mounted jousting battles. The player must line up their lance with the centre of the opponent's shield in order to knock him off the horse. A monetary prize is granted to the winner, which can be used to benefit your military conquest. The hero can also hold his own jousting tournaments from time to time.[CR][B]Ending:[/B][CR]Upon successfully completing the game (by defeating all the Norman factions) it is revealed that it was in fact Robin Hood who stole the crown. He did this in order to provide the hero a platform to prove their worthiness to become the new king of England. Robin returns the crown to the hero who is crowned king, and everyone lives happily ever after.[CR]Platform Differences[CR]The Amiga Version.[CR]Defender of the Crown was released on many different platforms. The main differences between platforms were the huge graphical differences. The Amiga version boasted the most technically proficient graphics and was heavily praised as one of the best looking games in 1986. The ports to the NES and DOS were the least graphically desirable versions of the game due to the limitations of the hardware.The DOS Version.[CR]Some gameplay differences also existed. The original Amiga version was rushed due to financial constraints on the developers, so several planned features (most notably attacking options such as flaming projectiles for the catapults and disease-based attacks) were absent from the final product. These features were included in some of the later ports of the game, including the Atari ST version.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Defender of the Crown was branded as an \"interactive movie\" and described by developers as a homage to several classic Hollywood movies, specifically Ivanhoe & Robin Hood.Five pages of the game's manual are dedicated to discussing the legend of Robin Hood and his historicity.At the time Defender of the Crown was the largest game ever released, taking up 1.5MB. For this reason, the tape version of the Commodore 64 release needed to be edited to remove several pictures, including pictures of Robin Hood at the start of the game.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP SP3 / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10Processor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 12. 2 MB available space[CR]System Requirements (Mac)[CR]MinimumOS :OS X 10.7.0 or newerProcessor : Intel Core 2 Duo 2 GHz+ processorMemory : 512 MB RAMGraphics : 256 MB VRAMHard Drive : 12.2 MB available space[CR]",

There are various things to consider, including the kind of load (certain ones require special vehicles and/or vehicles), the time frame, the capacity (a good workload is good for the balance, but delays cause contract penalties) and the route. Trucks can be upgraded (e.g. with a refrigerator wagon) or repaired.Of course there are various other options available, too: advertisement to reach new customers, sabotaging the competition, illegal goods, opening repair outposts, taking a loan or stock trading.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.[CR]Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the \"Madman\" himself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.[CR]There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.[CR]Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay.[CR]",

Depending on the resources they find, they'll start developing advanced settlements and cities, which can be used to start trading efforts between the fatherland and the new empire. [CR]There are five other nations with their own colonies in each area though, so competition is fierce enough to require the game to feature a combat module. This also comes into play when negotiations with the natives fail, and on sea, when facing pirates or enemy warships.[CR]The game features a comprehensive mouse-driven interface, as well as a choice of starting fatherland.",

Selena is grateful to your decision, and she gives you carte blanche to organize the defense of Dominium, because your starting human and material resources are very limited.[CR]The game flows as real-time strategy. Starting with factory, you should build units to examine neighbor lands covered by Fog of War. Finding resources such as gold mines or energy deposits, you should collect them, and build more units or fill them with fuel. The map representing fields, mountains and seas, is covered with a hexagonal grid. To move unit you should point it and destination cell. After that your units are moving between cells with real-time delay, exhausting fuel points per turn. There are 8 units: Jeep, Armor, WB Carrier, Fighter, Frigate, Cruiser, Stell Cargo, and Factory. Each unit is defined by 8 parameters: Speed, Range, Fire, Shield, Tank, Radar, Capacity, and Crew. The values of parameters, which may be increased and decreased also, define the cost of unit. Advisers and Selena will contact you during gameplay and inform you on different strategical events out of your sight.[CR]Finishing the level, 4 digits stellar code is given to you. Such level may be accessed by this code from main menu. The overall game progress may be also saved to file to be loaded later.[CR]The game may be played by single player or by two players via cable.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.[CR]Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.[CR]The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the \"Quick Time Event\" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different \"chapters\" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.[CR]In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played \"in reverse\" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.[CR]An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last \"life\" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon\u2019s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic \u201cAdventure\u201d was another inspiration for Dragon\u2019s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn\u2019t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic\u2019s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dreamweb is a point-and-click adventure game, Cyberpunk adventure game that drew influence from the Science Fiction film, Blade Runner. Though Dreamweb was not a massive commercial success, it was noted for several things. It featured a very unique top-down view, portrayed quite brutal violence, its exceptional soundtrack by Matt Seldon that helped give the game an incredibly gritty atmosphere and most infamously; Dreamweb contained, which was incredible controversy at the time, graphical portrayal of a sex scene.[CR]In 2012, the DOS version of the game was released as freeware, it is currently available through ScummVM's website.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dreamweb takes place in an unspecified dystopian American city. The player assumes control of the protagonist Ryan, who works as a bartender and has become increasingly plagued with dreams and visions. Before the start of the game, Ryan is visited in his dreams by the Keepers of the Dreamweb; which they claim to control the balance of the world. The Master Keeper tells Ryan that Seven Evils are uniting to destroy the Dreamweb and sends Ryan on a mission to stop them. As the game begins, Ryan awakes with the words 'I know now what I must do'.[CR]One of the unique aspects of Dreamweb was the way in which the writer handles the story. There is a certain ambiguity within the story's premise that leaves the player unsure whether the Dreamweb actually exists or whether Ryan has become mentally unstable and is losing his grip on reality. It is backed up by the seven targets all being high ranking and famous, yet at the same time, unconnected people in his own city and also by a booklet that was released with the game entitled 'Diary of a Madman' which was written to provide back story on Ryan's dreams.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features a top down view which is deemed uncommon in point-and-click adventure games. This interface, despite being unique, was met with mixed reviews from critics. Another unique feature is the way in which Ryan is able to pick up almost every object in the world, though this again was met with mixed criticism as some reviewers believed it confused puzzles. Ryan also acquires a gun early on and makes frequent use of it, almost always with gory results.[CR]",

Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.[CR]Scrooges office is your headquarters. Here you have three options  you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.[CR]You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. Its these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. Theres also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on whos winning between you and Glomgold.[CR]You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill  Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.[CR]Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.[CR]The jungle features Scrooges nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.[CR]Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.[CR]Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooges niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.[CR]Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.",

Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.[CR]The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story is loosely based on the novel. The game begins as House Atreides has moved to their new palace on the desert planet Arrakis (aka Dune), after Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV offered House Atreides the right to mine the Spice Melange, the most important substance in the galaxy. Duke Leto Artreides accepted the offer, not only for the wealth provided by spice trading, but also because the Atreides long-time enemies, the Harkonnen, stood to lose their mining rights and thereby their stranglehold on the spice.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is a unique mixture of first person adventure, and strategic management of military and economy. The player controls Paul Atreides who must explore the many secrets hidden in his new home on Arrakis but also visit many different characters to help drive the Harkonnen from Arrakis and make House Atreides the dominant power on Arrakis.A Ornithopter outside the Atreides palace[CR]When the game starts the Atreides family must make friends with the native Freman and that responsibility falls on Paul. In order to travel Paul must use Ornithopters, helicopter like vehicles with the appearance of insects, to travel to the sietches, underground caverns the Fremen use as homes, and convince the leaders of each sietch to work for House Atreides. At first the most important thing is to mine spice, but later in the game Paul can also choose to make the Fremen train as soldiers or specialise in ecology. Soldiers are the only ones who can attack and capture Harkonnen fortresses, and the Fremen who have specialized in Ecology can make the ground fertile, raising the morale of the Fremen, but also making it impossible to mine spice. The Fremen can be trained in all professions, but some Fremen are better suited for some jobs than others.[CR]A Fremen unit will train or work in the sietch it originates from but can be move to other sietchs or locations, unless the Fremen's morale is too low, then they will refuse to move. Spice is the main currency in the game and can be used to buy new equipment like spice harvesters or more advanced weaponry from smugglers. The Emperor will also demand a spice tribute every once in a while, that must be pay or else the game will be lost. However spice is not renewable and therefore must be spend wisely.[CR]Sometimes the Harkonnen will attack a sietch. Depending on the experience and profession of the units stationed there and their equipment the sietch may be taken by the Harkonnen, and must be reconquered to be used again.[CR]As Paul's physic abilities improve, the player can order the Freman leaders around with physic commands. This makes the game a lot easier as Paul is no longer limited to travel by Ornithopter, and only has to travel to speak with specific characters or explore new areas.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Paul AtreidesPaul, after drinking the water of life[CR]Paul is the son of Duke Leto Atreides, and is the protagonist of Dune. The game starts with Paul and his family arriving on Arrakis and trying to establish themselves on the inhospitable planet. As the game progresses Paul is forced to become the new duke of House Atreides after his father's death, convince the Fremen to join his cause and defeat the Harkonnen before they completely take over Arrakis.[CR]Paul's appearance is based on Kyle MacLachlan, who portrayed the same character in the David Lynch movie.Duke Leto Atreides[CR]The Duke Leto is the head of House Atreides and the father of Paul Atreides. He is a just and wise ruler who tries to improve the lives of his subjects. He is killed in a attack on a Harkonnen stronghold, leaving Paul to take over the reigns of House Atreides.Jessica Atreides[CR]Jessica is the mother of Paul and the wife of Duke Leto. She is part of the Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood that through immense physical and mental training are able to preform feats beyond that of a normal human. Throughout the game Jessica advices and helps Paul, sometimes using her powers to reveal secrets that were hidden before.Gurney Halleck[CR]Gurney is the military advisor to the duke of House Atreides. He can help train the Fremen making them into better soldiers.Duncan Idaho[CR]Duncan is the spice advisor. He informs the player when the emperor demands tribute.Emperor Shaddam IV[CR]Shaddam is the emperor of the known universe, and owns Arrakis. He regularly demands tribute which must be paid before the deadline or the game is over. Even though Shaddam offered Duke Leto the leadership of Dune, he is still working with the Baron Harkonnen.Harah[CR]Harah is a Fremen who helps Paul with contacting important Fremen leaders. She seems to be in love with Paul, but never becomes romantically involved with him.Thufir Hawat[CR]Thufir is a mentat (a human computer) who runs the communication room in the palace. He advices Paul on different matters.Stilgar[CR]Stilgar is a Fremen leader who works with Paul in order to drive the Harkonnen of Arrakis. He is somewhat of a parental figure for Chani, even though they are not related.Baron Harkonnen[CR]The Baron is the head of House Harkonnen. He is a grotesquely fat man, who is only able to move with the help of anti-gravity devices. He is a powerful opponent to Leto and Paul, and will stop at nothing to retake Arrakis.Feyd Rautha[CR]Feyd is the son of the Baron. He is somewhat of a rival to Paul, and preforms several stealth manoeuvres against the Atreides and their allies.ChaniChani[CR]Chani is the daughter of Liet Kynes. Later in the game she falls in love with Paul and they marry.Liet Kynes[CR]Liet is a scientist who tries to transform Dune into a lush green planet. He is the father of Chani.[CR]The Spice Opera[CR]In 1992 the soundtrack to Dune, composed by St\u00e9phane Picq and Phillip Ulrich, was released as Dune: The Spice Opera by Virgin Records. In 1993 Virgin Records were purchased by EMI and the copyright for the soundtrack was given to them. St\u00e9phane PicqDune: Spice Opera[CR]tried to acquired the rights to rerelease the album, but was unable to do so. The album has yet to be officially rereleased, making it extremely rare and sought after.[CR]Tracklist:[CR]1. Spice Opera 4.47[CR]2. Emotion Control 4.19[CR]3. Ecolove 5.01[CR]4. Water 3.05[CR]5.

The player can became the ruler of the elven kingdom by defeating the king in an Honour Fight. The player also stands to win the Dragon Fan, a mystical object which bestows the secrets of the universe upon its owner. Gameplay[CR]Map of Mhumulandia on a 6x6 grid (Amiga)The map of Muhmulandia is divided up into 36 squares which are called counties. The player needs to defeat opponents from six consecutive counties and create an unbroken line of 6 conquered counties in a row(vertically, horizontally or diagonally) on the map to win the crown and the Dragon Fan.You start off with 75 coins which you can use to buy the services of fighters. More experienced ones cost more coins, so at the start of game you can only choose between one of three characters(Janika, Taiki or Tenko) who cost 75 coins each. During the fight you can earn coins by hitting the opponents who thereupon release coins. These coins can be collected by hitting them. The bars at the top of the screen don't represent the amount of energy remaining they show the bank balances of the characters which will be reduced everytime the opponent lands a punch. For a won fight you get 50 coins plus the amount of the collected coins released by the opponents. Extra coins can be won in bonus stages or double prize fights. With the won coins you are able to hire some tougher fighters like Kosken, Seven or Matiki for later bouts. If you completely run out of coins you are not able to hire any fighters and the game is lost.The control methods of Elfmania are easy to use and there are no complicated joystick maneuvers like in Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat.The available moves are:Kicking - push the joystick in the opposite direction(away from the opponent) and press fireHigh Kick - push the joystick in the opposite direction and up at the same time and press fireSquat-Block - pull down and press fireStand-Block - pull back and press fireJumping - just push upPunching - push the joystick in the direction your character is facing and press fireSpecial Move - rapidly repeat a certain joystick combination like push back and fire or push back and up with fire Characters[CR]NameHome CountySpecial MoveJanika: The pirate elfThe pirate harbourSpinning Middle KickKosken: The executionerThe dungeonHigh PunchMatiki: The fat kingThe kings hallHammer SwingSeven: The guardianThe castle360-degree Sword SpinTaiki: The ice elfThe villageSpinning Jump KickTenko: The forest elfThe waterfallsSpinning High Kick[CR]",

To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. [CR]Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). [CR]For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the \"room\" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. [CR]As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. [CR]Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.",

Instead, sentences such as 'best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for 100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around 150,000' are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is.[CR]Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism.[CR]The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful.[CR]If you own either Emlyn Hughes' International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.",

                "plot": "[CR]Developed by the Late Jeremy C. Smith and Peter J. M. Irvin, Elite was way ahead of it's time both in innovation (foreshadowing Metroidvania and games such as Kirby and Prince of Persia 2008 with no Fail-States and in the sheer amount of features. In the mid 80s, action adventure games usually consisted of jumping platforms pits and monsters or the puzzles and platforming of games such as Thunderstruck and Dizzy. Exile loosely shared elements of the above, along with Thrust style physics (an earlier Lunar Lander type game by Jeremy)[CR]With the ability to fly, shoot or throw objects in practically any direction and the particle effects and physics involved, the roaming creatures which could follow you across the map (compared to simple back and forth movement of many games even well into the 16 bit era) as well as your (upgradeable) space suit having 4 pockets and the ability to remember 4 teleport destinations anywhere on Phoebus, how all this fit into The BBC/Acorn Electron's 32k (or even the 512k Amiga) is amazing.[CR]The game itself involved blasting your way into the mines, away from the harsh surface winds, encountering various forms of life such as the mischievous space imps and Maggots Triax experimented on, and the helpful Fluffy, exploring and solving physics based puzzles to find items including remote control devices (RCDs) to open doors and transporters, and whistles to control rogue robots, destroying or disabling turrets and doors and, eventually making your way to Triax.[CR]Since your thrusters and weapons all used the same energy capsules, and grenades were sparse trying to avoid combat and item conservation was important, but multiple solutions to some puzzles was possible, an early example being a small ship which had 2 grenades behind an explodable door, careful use of your first found grenade could get you both, at the risk of them being caught in the blast or if you were patient, one of the RCDs could open the door later on and get you both grenades without loss. Likewise you could shoot certain turrets or robots/creatures to gain energy capsules but the loss of energy via shooting or the loss of a grenade (and the risk that the unstable energy capsules would explode before you could pocket it had to be weighed up.[CR]Another early puzzle involved finding a flask and filling it with water from a pond to put out a fire surrounding the first RCD, but carrying the empty flask out of the small alcovein which it was first found would result in the door closing before you could leave, so you had to go halfway down the tunnel, where the door in question would automatically open, \"remember\" a teleport slot before entering the alcove, then throw the flask out and teleport back to catch it.[CR]",

The player takes control over a huge space ship with 3 million settlers; the big goal being to find a new home planet. Unfortunately the settlers are all frozen up and there is only a small amount of resources on the ship which makes it more or less defenseless. The game is a mostly menu-based strategy game. Most actions center around producing more smaller ships and weapons. However, everything needs resources which are gained by sending ships on gathering missions on meteors. By experimenting with the resources at hand, the player can either discover new items to produce or make a unhealthy bang. The smaller ships are piloted by settlers which have to be unfrozen and trained individually. Their statistics influence their successes during missions and fights. The latter may occur when the player meets other ships while travelling through space. Besides attacking on sight, there is the possibility to have a multiple-choice conversation with them. Optionally the player can participate in missions or fights by taking the role of a space ship. This plays out as first-person action which controls similar to Elite.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The sequel to  Eye of the Beholder takes place shortly after the success of the heroes from the first game, presumably the player's party, over the beholder, Xanathar, which had saved the city.[CR]However, frequent reports of missing travelers on the outskirts of Waterdeep have begun to filter into the hands of the Lords of Waterdeep and once again, the City's greatest Archmage, Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun, calls upon the party to investigate the matter. Villagers are disappearing and the city guard are wary of wandering too far into the woods to the north and west for fear of what might be waiting for the overly curious. With the discovery of several shallow graves and the journal of a self-styled archeologist hinting at even darker mysteries, the party has little to go on until they discover Temple Darkmoon. There, amidst three towers, they must uncover its mysteries and destroy the evil lurking within.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder II (EotB II) was the second game in the AD&D based  Eye of the Beholder trilogy published by  SSI as a part of their \"Legend Series\". It would the last title developed for SSI by  Westwood Associates, the same developers that would go on to become Westwood Studios. As with its predecessor, it was notable at the time for its use of lush 3D graphics, extensive puzzles, and animated monster encounters along with the degree of interactivity that players had within its dungeons, but would include a variety of improvements such as deeper role-playing experience and a larger area to explore.[CR]The objective of the game was to explore the mysterious Temple of Darkmoon on the request of the archmage, Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun. It soon becomes clear that there is far more to the Temple than previously suspected and the party will need to unravel its secrets in order to survive.[CR]The game was a licensed product of TSR's  2nd Edition AD&D rules and used the  Forgotten Realms campaign setting as did the previous games.[CR]Copy protection took the form of a verification question accompanied by an illustration. Matching the illustration with the correct one in the manual would produce the correct answer. Copies were also encouraged in order to preserve the original disks.[CR]The manual was also notable for including a great deal of information concerning the monsters, classes, and weapons that could be encountered within the game, all adhering to the 2nd Edition AD&D ruleset. Experience tables and other pieces of information were located in the back of the manual.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with the  rest of the series, tthe game uses a  grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. Within the ever-present interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed on the right. A text box on the bottom part of the screen displayed various messages while a compass was also shown when outside of combat. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Everything in the interface continued to be mouse driven.[CR]As with most RPGs, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. If the player so chose to create a party of warriors, they could expect extreme difficulty ahead without a mage to help teleport them back home, out of a dungeon, or heal them adequately in combat. A party is limited to six characters.[CR]Veterans from the  first EotB game will be able to import their characters. A pre-built party is also available for play for those that do not want to go through the creation process. Races[CR]No new races were added to the sequel and many of the same restrictions and statistical rules remained unchanged. Six races are given to the player to choose from and build a party of characters with as before.[CR]As with the  first game, players can only generate four characters on their own to make up the initial party. Two slots are reserved for potential NPCs that may join later on in the game, creating a total of six adventurers that can make up the group.[CR]In keeping with the 2nd Edition AD&D ruleset, each race has its own set of restrictions concerning both what classes are available to them such as how far they can advance in certain ones. Racial modifiers can also affect their efficiency in certain professions. Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialties are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters. They have a bonus to dexterity and the use of bows along with long or short swords. They are highly resistant to charm or sleep spells. Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong, they are renowned for their smithing skills as well as their combat abilities. Being a somewhat non-magical race, they have good resistances against many spells and even poisons. Halflings: Short in stature, friendly to a fault, and generally good natured, halflings are also innately resistant to spells. They're also dextrous making them decent fighters and sticky fingered rogues.Half Elves: They have no racial modifiers but are somewhat resistant to sleep and charm spells. However, because of their longer lifespans, they are able to multiclass with a greater number of combinations than other races and are decent fighters. Gnome: Good as clerics, thieves, and even fighters, they are also fairly magic resistant as their distant cousins, the dwarves, are. Classes[CR]As with  Eye of the Beholder, six  classes are made available to players to choose from, each with its own set of restrictions. Each classes require certain prime requisites, or ability scores, to be at certain values before that character can become part of that class. No major changes have been made to this system and it would continue to be used throughout the series in much of the same way.Fighter: The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. They can use magical weapons, rings, but can cast no spells. As they gain levels, they also gain speed which enables them to attack more often in combat. The prime requisite for this class is strength and any race and alignment can be a member.Paladin: These are elite fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be and will not join a party that has evil members. They are immune to disease, have increased resistances to spell effects and poison, and can heal other characters with their \"laying on of hands\" ability. At higher levels, they are also able to turn undead and can cast certain clerical spells. They also have a persistent aura around them that acts as a negative affect on evil creatures that come too close. Only humans with good scores in both Strength and Charisma can become this class.Thieves: A high dexterity is a prime requisite for this class and they are restricted in wearing only leather-type armor and in using a limited number of weapons. Any race can be this class and it is considered an important one to have in the game to avoid getting the party killed whenever a trap is found.Rangers: They can use any weapon as a fighter can and can even dual wield melee weapons without any penalty, but only if they are not wearing heavy armor. Humans, elves, and half-elves are the only races that are allowed in the game that can be a part of this class.Cleric: They are holy warriors that can fight with a number of weapons and wear armor while casting divine spells against their enemies. Ideal for dealing with the undead as well as healing the party. Wisdom is the prime requisite for this class and any race can be a part of it.Mages: The spellcasters of the Realm, what they lack in armor and weapons expertise are made up for in the spells that they can weave. Unlike several other RPG systems of the time that utilized spell points, mages in AD&D have to memorize a set number of spells in order to store and use them at a later time. Once those memorized spells are used up, the mage must take time to memorize another batch. Intelligence is the prime requisite for this class and as they gain in level, they also gain extra slots that can be used to store memorized spells. Humans, Elves, and Half-Elves can become mages in the game. Alignment[CR]AD&D along with many other PnP RPGs at the time made extensive use of an alignment system to determine a character's worldview and how they conducted themselves within society which would also be reflected in EotB II's mechanics. The entire series used this system but it did not impact the main narrative in a meaningful way, other than in determining who or what could join the party.[CR]World View:Lawful: A character will work within the lawsNeutral: A character will move between valuing a society and valuing an individual.Chaotic: A character will choose the good of the individual above that of everything else.[CR]Ethics:Good: The character tries to act in a moral and upstanding manner.Neutral: A character leans towards evaluating 'situational ethics' depending on the circumstances.Evil: A character acts without regard for others or in an overly malignant manner.[CR]For example, a Lawful Good character would be by-the-book when it came to upholding the good in society while a Chaotic Good character would be more willing to bend the rules in order to provide the same. A Lawful Evil character might hold their word as their bond and be loathe to break it for anyone, but would only give it if confronted by someone whose power they respect or as a part of one of their fell schemes. As interesting as this was, the game did not make an extensive use of the potential that this system could bring to an RPG. Attributes[CR]None of the basic character  attributes used to determine what classes were available for certain characters and how well they would perform in them would significantly change from the first game and even into the third title,  Assault of Myth Drannor. They would continue to be based upon TSR's 2nd Edition AD&D ruleset, however, with all of the set limits and restrictions.[CR]Attribute scores of 18 were still considered the highest possible in a natural sense, although racial bonuses and magical effects/enhancements in the form of spells or items would be able to raise them higher either temporarily or permanently in more rare cases. These are set as far as the game was concerned. Leveling improved a character's HP (hit points) and general abilities, but their base statistics would almost never change.Strength: This determines the amount of physical damage that a character can inflict. With a strength statistic of 18, an additional variable is added to indicate exceptional strength as a percentage shown as 18/23.Constitution: A character's health and toughness is determined by this. In AD&D, this has other effects outside of simply determining the HP amount gained after every level, such as a character's resistance to certain physical effects.Intelligence: A vital attribute for mages as they learn spells.Dexterity: Characters with a high dexterity tend to be nimble and agile improving their AC (armor class) which measures how hard they are to hit in combat. Important for every class, but more so with others such as fighters and thieves. With a score of 16 or higher, fighters can negate some of the penalties levied against them for using dual weapons.Charisma: This determines how attractive or repulsive a character is to everyone around them, whether it is in how they carry themselves in conversation or appear in public. Important for paladins.Wisdom: A character's innate ability to judge situations and make the best choices. It is also important in spell resistance and particularly key for clerics. Higher wisdom scores above 13 also translate into extra spells that clerics can utilize.[CR]Combat[CR]The fighting system would also remain relatively unchanged from the  first game making it extremely accessible to veterans.[CR]Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. The front ranks, determined by the two characters at the top of the party list, can engage in melee combat. All other characters must resort to ranged weapons or spells in order to join in the fight. An onscreen menu guided their actions and right clicking with the mouse on the appropriate icon, such as a warrior's sword, would cause them to act.[CR]Camping was available for the player to rest and heal the party, memorize spells, and save the game when necessary.[CR]NPC Companions[CR]As well as creating your own party of player characters, throughout the course of your adventure in the temple of Darkmoon it is possible to find and recruit other NPC characters to join your cause.INSAL Insal is a Halfling thief who can be found in the level 1 Underground. He has been captured by the priests of Darkmoon and if you free him from his shackles he will offer to join your party, or you are given the option of setting him free.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder (EotB) is the first game in the  AD&D-based  Eye of the Beholder trilogy published by SSI as a part of their \"Legend Series.\" It was developed by Westwood Associates, the same developers that would go on to become Westwood Studios, and published by SSI. It was notable at the time for its use of lush 3D graphics, extensive puzzles, and animated monster encounters along with the degree of interactivity that players had within its dungeons such as flipping levers, weighing down pressure plates with stones, and its real-time interface. The game pits a party of adventurers against the machinations of a beholder known as Xanathar: a ruthless criminal hiding deep beneath the port city of Waterdeep.[CR]The game is a licensed TSR product, and implements the  2nd Edition AD&D ruleset and features the  Forgotten Realms campaign setting that had been used in previous SSI AD&D games such as the Gold Box series. In the Forgotten Realms setting, Waterdeep is one of the greatest cities of the era, the so-called \"Crown of the North,\" a vital trading hub whose wealth has seen its environs and its influence expand rapidly throughout the Sword Coast region. The secretive Lords of Waterdeep, the unseen council that both watches and protects the city from fell schemes discovered outside and within its own walls, maintain the tenuous balance of power between the factions there in order to ensure its survival. Only one of these Lords is ever shown as the \"public\" face in order to act as a liaison between the people and themselves.[CR]Copy protection takes the form of challenge questions that the player will occasionally be asked during the course of the game that would refer to a specific word within the game manual. Copies were encouraged in order to preserve the original disks. The console versions did not include this aspect.[CR]The manual is also notable for including a great deal of information concerning the monsters, classes, and weapons that could be encountered within the game, all adhering to the 2nd Edition AD&D ruleset. Experience tables and other pieces of information are located in the back of the manual. The following manuals would be similar in design, although the monsters described would be changed from one title to the next. The manual for Eye of the Beholder also contains a rough map of Waterdeep as well as a historical primer on its significance.[CR]The game was ported to consoles in 1994, including a  SNES version by  Capcom and a  Sega CD version by  Sega. While Capcom's version is a more faithful reproduction of the original, the Sega CD version was an enhanced  remake famous for its CD soundtrack composed by  Yuzo Koshiro. Departing from the  chiptune medieval music of the the original PC version, Koshiro's Sega CD soundtrack was one of the first  ambient  electronica soundtracks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder's story begins with a meeting called by Piergeiron, the current Lord of Waterdeep, with the party. He hands them a letter describing a threat that his friend, the Archmage, Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun, has detected witin the city and requests that the party investigate the disturbances and, if necessary, deal with them in whatever method they see fit. They are given an official commission from the city and are quickly ushered to the sewers where they believe the threat to be located. However, their unseen nemesis has been waiting for them and the only way out is suddenly blocked by a thundering avalanche of rocks and stone, forcing the player to delve deeper below the streets of Waterdeep and to a confrontation with their foe.[CR]After a series of traps and challenges that the party encounters during the adventure, they come face to face with Xanathar, a beholder who is also acting as the major crime lord of Waterdeep who has been plotting his ascension to power. After a climactic battle in which Xanatar is defeated, the party is celebrated as heroes of the city.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses a  grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. Within the ever-present interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed on the right. A text box on the bottom part of the screen displays various messages while a compass is also shown when outside of combat. Random enemy encounters provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Everything in the interface is mouse-driven.[CR]Party setup and character selection are left entirely up to the player and many of the mechanisms and options available would remain unchanged through the next two iterations of the series. The party would always remain limited to six characters.Races[CR]Six races are available for players to choose from and would be the first step in creating a new batch of characters. Gender has no bearing on a character's performance aside from making available the appropriate portraits during character creation. Many of the steps utilized in this part of the game would continue to act as the standard setup throughout the series.[CR]In keeping with the 2nd Edition AD&D ruleset, each race has its own set of restrictions concerning both what classes are available to them such as how far they can advance in certain ones. Racial modifiers can also affect their efficiency in certain professions. Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialties are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters. They have a bonus to dexterity and the use of bows along with long or short swords. They are highly resistant to charm or sleep spells. Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong, they are renowned for their smithing skills as well as their combat abilities. Being a somewhat non-magical race, they have good resistances against many spells and even poisons. Halflings: Short in stature, friendly to a fault, and generally good natured, halflings are also innately resistant to spells. They're also dexterous making them decent fighters and sticky fingered rogues.Half Elves: They have no racial modifiers but are somewhat resistant to sleep and charm spells. However, because of their longer lifespans, they are able to multi-class with a greater number of combinations than other races and are decent fighters. Gnome: Good as clerics, thieves, and even fighters, they are also fairly magic resistant as their distant cousins, the dwarves, are.Classes[CR]As with many RPGs, the game offers a choice to the player to select from a variety of classes that they could use to first create their characters and, ultimately, their parties with.[CR]Throughout the entire  Eye of the Beholder series, six  classes would be made available to players to choose from, each with its own set of restrictions, although certain races have the ability to multi-class meaning that they can become a combination of classes. Each classes require certain prime requisites, or ability scores, to be at certain values before that character can become part of that class.Fighter: The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. They can use magical weapons, rings, but can cast no spells. As they gain levels, they also gain speed which enables them to attack more often in combat. The prime requisite for this class is strength and any race and alignment can be a member.Paladin: These are elite fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be and will not join a party that has evil members. They are immune to disease, have increased resistances to spell effects and poison, and can heal other characters with their \"laying on of hands\" ability. At higher levels, they are also able to turn undead and can cast certain clerical spells. They also have a persistent aura around them that acts as a negative affect on evil creatures that come too close. Only humans with good scores in both Strength and Charisma can become this class.Thieves: A high dexterity is a prime requisite for this class and they are restricted in wearing only leather-type armor and in using a limited number of weapons. Any race can be this class and it is considered an important one to have in the game to avoid getting the party killed whenever a trap is found.Rangers: They can use any weapon as a fighter can and can even dual wield melee weapons without any penalty, but only if they are not wearing heavy armor. Humans, elves, and half-elves are the only races that are allowed in the game that can be a part of this class.Cleric: They are holy warriors that can fight with a number of weapons and wear armor while casting divine spells against their enemies. Ideal for dealing with the undead as well as healing the party. Wisdom is the prime requisite for this class and any race can be a part of it.Mages: The spellcasters of the Realm, what they lack in armor and weapons expertise are made up for in the spells that they can weave. Unlike several other RPG systems of the time that utilized spell points, mages in AD&D have to memorize a set number of spells in order to store and use them at a later time. Once those memorized spells are used up, the mage must take time to memorize another batch. Intelligence is the prime requisite for this class and as they gain in level, they also gain extra slots that can be used to store memorized spells. Humans, Elves, and Half-Elves can become mages in the game.Alignment[CR]AD&D along with many other PnP RPGs at the time makes extensive use of an  alignment system to determine a character's worldview and how they conduct themselves within society which would also be reflected in EotB's mechanics as well as that of its following sequels.[CR]World View:Lawful: A character will work within the lawsNeutral: A character will move between valuing a society and valuing an individual.Chaotic: A character will choose the good of the individual above that of everything else.[CR]Ethics:Good: The character tries to act in a moral and upstanding manner.Neutral: A character leans towards evaluating 'situational ethics' depending on the circumstances.Evil: A character acts without regard for others or in an overly malignant manner.[CR]For example, a Lawful Good character would be by-the-book when it came to upholding the good in society while a Chaotic Good character would be more willing to bend the rules in order to provide the same. A Lawful Evil character might hold their word as their bond and be loathe to break it for anyone, but would only give it if confronted by someone whose power they respect or as a part of one of their fell schemes. As interesting as this was, the game did not make an extensive use of the potential that this system could bring to an RPG.Attributes[CR]Character  attributes would help determine what classes were available for certain characters and how well they would perform in them. In 2nd Edition AD&D, attribute scores of 18 were considered the highest possible in a natural sense, although racial bonuses and magical effects/enhancements in the form of spells or items would be able to raise them higher either temporarily or permanently in more rare cases. These are set as far as the game was concerned. Leveling improved a character's HP (hit points) and general abilities, but their base statistics would almost never change.[CR]EotB and its  following sequels would also allow the player to modify statistics during character creation with any number of changes that were limited only by the maximum level a particular attribute could be as determined by race.Strength: This determines the amount of physical damage that a character can inflict. With a strength statistic of 18, an additional variable is added to indicate exceptional strength as a percentage shown as 18/23.Constitution: A character's health and toughness is determined by this. In AD&D, this has other effects outside of simply determining the HP amount gained after every level, such as a character's resistance to certain physical effects.Intelligence: A vital attribute for mages as they learn spells.Dexterity: Characters with a high dexterity tend to be nimble and agile improving their AC (armor class) which measures how hard they are to hit in combat. Important for every class, but more so with others such as fighters and thieves. With a score of 16 or higher, fighters can negate some of the penalties levied against them for using dual weapons.Charisma: This determines how attractive or repulsive a character is to everyone around them, whether it is in how they carry themselves in conversation or appear in public. Important for paladins.Wisdom: A character's innate ability to judge situations and make the best choices. It is also important in spell resistance and particularly key for clerics. Higher wisdom scores above 13 also translate into extra spells that clerics can utilize.[CR]Combat[CR]Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. The front ranks, determined by the two characters at the top of the party list, can engage in melee combat. All other characters must resort to ranged weapons or spells in order to join in the fight. An onscreen menu guides their actions and right clicking with the mouse on the appropriate icon, such as a warrior's sword, would cause them to act.[CR]Camping is available for the player to rest and heal the party, memorize spells, and save the game when necessary.[CR]NPC Companions[CR]As well as creating a party of player characters, during the adventure beneath the city of Waterdeep it is possible to find other adventurers who will offer their services to help the player characters in defeating Xanathar.TOD UPHILLTod is a Halfling Thief who accidentally fell down a sewer grate in the city of Waterdeep.

There are 3 difficulty levels, and the number of laps is variable.[CR]The field includes 22 cars (you can choose between a Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Benetton), and contact with these (or with the kerbing or roadside barriers) inflicts damage on your car. This may get bad enough that you have to pit for repairs (if you don't make it to the pits and have more contact, you may get forced out altogether). Avoiding the slower cars you come up to lap can be crucial.",

Each level features several different people's faces; creating a \"perfect\" face from the parts of a single person will clear the face and all blocks in the column underneath. Creating a mixed face will clear only the face itself and one block underneath. Each level uses a selection of personalities including historical figures, artists, scientists, and monsters. Levels at higher difficulties include a larger number of different personalities.[CR]Faces featured a multiplayer mode with competitive two player head-to-head play. Another interesting feature was the ability to load your own graphics into the game, replacing the default faces with your family members, dog, or whatever other images you liked.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]In a twist on the concept of the Incorrect Usage of Cyrillic Letters, Faces uses a hammer and sickle symbol as the the letter 'C' in its title.[CR]",

The enemies, which lower the energy bar when touched, are the human defense systems like antibody cells. Besides shooting enemies, there are also various passages in which the player needs to guide the submarine through narrow corridors without touching the environment. On the way the player needs to collect nine circuit boards required to destroy the blood cot; those may be hidden in dead ends or alternate ways. This means the player can move back and forth to try other routes at forks. It is important to pick up oxygen and fuel canisters in order to keep the submarine functional. Shield energy can be refilled by killing three enemies without missing a shot.",

Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies. [CR]If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over.  Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him.[CR]Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life. Besides enemies, other hazards need to be looked out for, including spike, spikeballs, water, and fire.",

For instance, in the diving, the player must land in progressively smaller receptacles, the final part requiring successful navigation into a tea cup!  The controls and player input required change with each act.  The game was released across most 8-bit computer systems. The game was included as part of a bundle on some systems.

The AGA and CD32 versions support 256 on-screen colors at a resolution of 320x256 instead of the 32 on-screen colors at a lower resolution used in the ECS version. Apart from that, there are no big differences between the three versions at all. [CR]AGA version (Amiga 1200)ECS version (Amiga 500)        Gameplay[CR]In Fightin' Spirit you have the choice between ten main plus two hidden fighters with their special moves and various attack styles. The two hidden characters(Jenshi Yamamoto and Shiro Asuka) can be enabled by a cheat. Every fighter has four special moves which can be executed by a certain joystick/pad combination. The characters are accompannied by their various attractive backgrounds and animations. You can either fight in a VS battle(single fight against an human opponent), a team match or a tournament(up to eight human players can join a tournament). But the most interesting part is to fight in the story mode. Here you can pick one of the characters and join the Supreme Warriors Tournament where you can defeat Jenshi Yamamoto, the boss of the Hikawa secret organisation.

However, she is near an mysterious asteroid which threatens to destroy Earth. So she goes out to investigate and she finds an apparently deserted space station. She has to investigate all floors to be able to save Earth.The main challenge of the game is to find a way through the maze-like corridors of each floor. Laira can either walk or use her jet pack for vertical movement which takes fuel. She also needs to watch our for obstacles like electrified bars which block certain passages and droids which are best avoided because of they see Laira, the time limit is shortened or they try to kill her. She has no weapons except for mines which have to be found on the station: laying the on the ground causes everyone to die who walks over them (including Laira). There are also other pieces of equipment to find, e.g. extra fuel.Laira also often has to operate computer terminals to gain information and open closed passages, e.g. by opening doors, activating elevators or deactivating traps. While most of the game is shown from the side, the game switches to a first-person view and player has to type in commands to interact with the terminal; similar to using DOS. The terminal understands 13 commands which are explained in the manual. Mistakes in operating the system may result in an alarm and therefore a  time penalty.",

It is a side-scrolling beat-em up with attacks consisting mainly of simple punching and kicking, as well as grabs, throws, aerial attacks and special moves which clear the area around the player while draining a small amount of health. Knives, swords and pipes can also be used. In the original arcade release, there are three playable characters: Cody, Haggar , and Guy.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Damnd Taunting Hagger[CR]The story revolves around a street gang known as Mad Gear kidnapping Jessica, who is Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend. Instead of giving in to the gang, Haggar, Cody, and Cody's training partner, Guy, take to the streets of Metro City to destroy the gang and rescue Jessica. The player fights through the streets, through the subway system, through a wrestling ring, and eventually fight all the way the leader of the Mad Gear gang's mansion. The final boss is the leader of the Mad Gear gang on a wheelchair with Jessica on his lap rolling around and shooting the heroes with a crossbow. The trio eventually beat him out of his chair and kick him through the large window he is standing next to.[CR]Hardware[CR]An original Final Fight arcade machine[CR]Final Fight was originally on Capcom's CPS arcade hardware. It featured a dedicated cabinet with a control panel that had two buttons and a 8-way joystick. Although three characters where selectable only two player could play at a single cabinet. Cabinet Colors varied but where typically black, with large character graphics where featured on the side.[CR]Ports Sequels and Emulation[CR]The SNES version of Final Fight[CR]The SNES version, released in North America in 1991, disappointed many because it dropped the co-op play, removing arguably the most attractive element of the game and it also removes Guy as a playable character. Though a second version was later released in 1994, called Final Fight: Guy, where Guy was a playable character and Cody was not. This version was available as a rental-only game from Blockbuster video stores.[CR]It was recently discovered that two variations of Final Fight: Guy exist- the common \"orange box\", and the rarer \"black box.\" There is a lot of confusion as to where these black box version came from, and very few have ever been found. Theories express that it could have been the original color of the box until an exclusive deal was later made with Blockbuster or that it was a Canadian variant, despite it being marked as available in the US. This small variation can make these versions of the game very valuable from a collector's standpoint.[CR]Two sequels, Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3, were released on the SNES in 1993 and 1995, respectively.[CR]The game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as Final Fight One. Final Fight: One featured small dialog exchanges before boss fights, unlockable features, and the Street Fighter: Alpha versions of Cody ,and Guy.[CR]Final Fight: Double Impact was a PSN and XBLA game that was attached with Magic Sword.[CR]The game was also released as part of the 'Capcom Arcade' on iOS ( iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) in 2011.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Haggar[CR]The big slow strong character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the pipe, and has a piledriver and spinning lariat. He is the mayor of Metro City as well as Jessica's Father.Cody[CR]The middle of the road character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the knife, he is the only character able to use the knife without throwing it. He uses a jumping spin kick, and is Jessica's boyfriend.Guy[CR]The fast character of Final Fight.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flashback: The Quest for Identity is a 2D action-adventure platform game originally developed by Delphine Software International and published by U.S. Gold for Commodore Amiga home computers in 1992. The game stars plucky protagonist Conrad B. Hart, a young man stricken with total amnesia who finds himself stranded deep in the jungles of an alien world. Similar to Delphine's earlier title Out of This World, Flashback is notable for its use of rotoscoped animation, allowing for a visually fluid representation of the characters' various movements.[CR]The game was first released on floppy diskette for the Amiga, a home computer popular in Delphine's native France; it was eventually ported to MS-DOS, Super NES, Genesis, Atari Jaguar and the Acorn Archimedes the following year. A CD-ROM version was later released for MS-DOS, Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO and FM Towns in 1994. Many of Flashback's ports were developed wholly or in part by Tiertex Design Studios.[CR]Flashback: The Quest for Identity was followed by its 1995 sequel Fade to Black. The original game was remade in 2013 with full 3D graphics and was released simply as Flashback with no subtitle.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens in medias res as protagonist Conrad B. Hart flees down a corridor from a pair of men armed with laser weapons. Conrad jumps onto a hoverbike and temporarily evades his assailants; however, a much larger transport soon gives chase and quickly blasts Conrad's vehicle out of the sky. After a brief search of the crash area, the armed transport flies off, leaving Conrad for dead in the depths of an unknown jungle.AmnesiaFlashback features rotoscoped cutscenes.[CR]Conrad awakens the next day in an alien jungle on a planet known as Titan. It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.[CR]A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game.Employment[CR]With his memories restored Conrad decides he needs to return to Earth. With little money however, this was never going to be as easy as it sounds. Ian suggests that Conrad should take part in a TV Show where he must fight Cyborgs for a chance to win a ticket to Earth. As it would be too dangerous to compete under his own name Conrad has to get false ID papers. Ian sends him to a contact named Jack, who demands 1,500 credits for the papers. Since he doesn't have that sort of cash on hand Conrad partakes in multiple odd jobs available in New Washington.[CR]First he is hired by Titan Spaces Lines for an apparently easy job of collecting and delivering a parcel. Just outsides the parcels destination he is attacked by a member of the NWPD but overcomes him and delivers the package.[CR]The second mission comes from Virtual Crop that requests Conrad escort a VIP to their research center. It is made clear that the mission will require a firearm ad the area traveled in will be dangerous. The warning is well advised since mutants infest the area in addition to malfunctioning Security Spheres. Like previously though Conrad succeeds.[CR]Titan TV hires Conrad for the third mission. They report that a Model Cy-Borg 2.1 has escaped with the possible assistance of an outsider. It carries a virus which could spread to all other functioning cyborgs. A police officer informs Conrad that the Cy-Borg wants to make a deal. This turns out to be a trap however and Conrad kills the Police Officer for access to 2.1\u2019s lair. Once in his hideout Conrad eliminates 2.1.[CR]The penultimate New Washington mission is accomplished for Titan Senior Advisory Board. Sabotage to the generator that supplies power to New Washington means the city is on the verge of blowing up. Conrad has 90 seconds to locate the sabotaged area and repair it. With only seconds left Conrad repairs the generator and saves New Washington.[CR]With only one mission required to gain the necessary credits for the false papers, another party hires Conrad to eliminate the mutant threat that is lurking in all the Restricted Areas. After accomplishing this task Conrad meets Jack one more time who now hands over the papers allowing entry into the game show.[CR]The game show of requires participants to fight their way through eight different levels of deadly situations. Littered throughout every level are Cy-Borg 2.1s, Sentry Spheres and mines. Conrad manages to fight through all levels and win a ticket to Earth.Back on EarthEarth[CR]Conrad believes The Morphs have a hidden base within a night club on Earth but upon arrival is attacked by the local law enforcement and security measures. After some time he locates the nightclub. He breaks in through an upper level thus causing more security measures to become active making his job of finding the Morphs more complicated.[CR]After much tribulation Conrad finds himself in a vent shaft above a group of Morphs that are discussing their plans. They reveal that soon their invasion will begin since millions of their kind are ready to teleport in and destroy humanity. Conrad\u2019s vent then proceeds to collapse under his weight and he is discovered. It is decided that he will be thrown into the dungeon with plans for interrogation.[CR]After he wakes up in his cell Conrad discovers he is unarmed and that Cy-Borgs have been sent to his cell to carry out the interrogation. Unexpectedly though Conrad makes a quick burst for the door and evades the Cy-Borgs. Luckily enough his gun was not too far away and he is able to destroy his would-be interrogators. Further into their lair Conrad finally confronts the Morphs in combat. With their ability to take and lose shape whenever they want Conrad has a difficult time but overcomes everyone he meets. With the realization that the Morph invasion is close with no time to report it, Conrad teleports to the Morph home planet with the intention of stopping their conquest.[CR]On the planet Conrad tries to assist a human prisoner who is in possession of explosives. Unfortunately the man is killed by a Morph upon his release but lives long enough to give Conrad the destructive device. Conrad discovers a diary on the planet that reveals a captive human scientist managed to enter the theory of molecular research into a Titan computer. This theory was taken up by Conrad who made glasses revealing the aliens living among the human population. It is also revealed that The Master Brain, positions at the center of the planet, controls all morphs, destroying him will end the race. The device Conrad holds was created by the scientist and is powerful enough to destroy the entire planet.[CR]With other options being non-existent, Conrad decides to put the scientist's plan into action. He travels all the way into the planet\u2019s core. After battling more Morphs the Master Brain is killed. After dropping the Atomic Charge into the foundations of the planet Conrad races against time to escape the planet in a docked ship before the planet explodes.[CR]Conrad only just makes it, with the ship just out of reach from the destructive force of the Atomic Device. Conrad soon learns though that he is in a galaxy unrecognized by the ship\u2019s systems. With the possibility of being lost in space forever Conrad places himself in cryogenic suspension to be awakened if he is ever discovered.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 9,9,9,8 in addition to the Editor's Choice Gold award. They added, \"...one of the best games ever made for the Genesis. The action is non-stop, and it really feels like you're playing a movie!...get a joystick, because the generic Sega controllers aren't precise enough to handle the diagonal motions necessary for some of the specialized techniques\".[CR]",

Based in 1949, the lead character, Joe King is the pilot of the \"Amazon Queen\" which crash lands in the Amazon jungle and it's up to Joe to save both his passenger, the one and only movie star Faye Russel, but also an entire tribe of Amazonian women from a twisted plot involving an evil mastermind and... lederhosen.[CR]Freeware Release[CR]In 2004, the game was re-released as Freeware with support for ScummVM, allowing it to be used on any device that supports the use of this engine. Of recent years, this also includes the ability to play this game on handheld devices and even the iPhone.[CR]GOG.com released a packaged version of the game for Mac OS on their service in September 2013.[CR]",

The missions are played alongside up to 7 AI wing men (4 of each aircraft type), and the player can switch between the planes at will, as well as select their loadouts in the pre-mission briefing. At the games harder difficulty levels the the player would have to worry about the reliability of the plane and it's weaponry - the F-4 would not have an internal cannon, and would have to rely on heat seeking and radar guided missiles that were prone to misfire, as well as an engine creating a visible smoke trail that would alert enemies. On the hardest difficulty the player would also have to follow basic rules of engagement. There were - as per usual for flight simulators at the time - several difficulty levels and an easily accessible cheat menu that would allow the player to make the plane invincible or have unlimited ammunition.There was a non-advertised serial port based multi-player mode included in the game, where one player would be able to fly the MiG's (otherwise not accessible to the player) in head to head combat.The game was in production before the novel's publication. Mirrorsoft obtained permission to use Coonts' name after the novel was a success, and the book was bundled with most releases of the game. He also wrote the introduction to the manual.Rereleases after 1991 generally used the same cover art as the movie.[CR]",

The premise is that governments are held together by a complicated behind-the-scenes web of information manipulation, spying, and the removal of potential trouble-makers. The player is the person in charge.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This is an menu-driven game. A turn (which takes up one day) will go like this: players enter your office and read any reports that are on their desk, then respond to whatever is in the report by giving orders to the necessary departments. Players can place phone-tapping, conduct mail-interception, abduction, torture and even murder. However players must try to keep a low profile or else they will be fired. Floor 13 has static black & white graphics that are suitable and only a few, sparse sounds and musical cues at the beginning and end of a scenario.[CR]The main character is only in control insofar as he or she does what is in the best interest of the ruling government, who pays the bills. Should the player not pursue, smear, or destroy enough of the government's enemies in the time allotted, the player will be fired, or even rubbed out.[CR]Because this is a simulation, there aren't many opportunities for error, and due to the randomly generated conspiracies and events, the player may not get to see very much of what's going on before they have to act. Even acting in what seems to be an appropriate manner for the position may have unforeseen consequences that will damage the government's reputation and push players that much closer to being fired, or disappearing. [CR]The player is usually given one or more reports when he or she arrives at the office every morning. These often detail news reports or intelligence briefings which have information that will be represented in subsequent files. For instance, a prominent judge frees a wealthy man accused of various crimes. The following pages are dossiers for both the judge and the accused, and the reason for their being included in the file (one may have anti-government sympathies, while another is merely connected to the issue at hand).[CR]Depending on the person, place, or group in the dossier, players can select some of the following actions to deal with the problem:SURVEILLANCE - Conduct this on a suspect's home to potentially pick up mail or phone calls which may prove useful leads.PURSUIT - A more active form of surveillance, a team will track every activity of the targeted subject for a given day.SEARCH - Either discretely break in and search a place, or ransack it with a better chance of discovering items of interest.INFILTRATION - Send a number of agents to insinuate themselves into any suspected group for information gathering.INTERROGATION - Abduct a subject, interrogate them to varying degrees, and invariably terminate them at the end.REMOVAL - Kill off a target within a certain number of days relative to their importance.HEAVY ASSAULT - A precisely timed strike on a location that succeeds or fails based on that timing.DIS-INFORMATION - Use slush funds to conduct a smear campaign on a group or individual, which may boost government approval.[CR]Individual progress reports come in after set time periods, and archives of results are kept even after incriminating records are expunged.[CR]Players also meet up with the Prime Minister to receive personal feedback on their performance so far. After a set period of time, if public approval is down, the player character will be fired, while if the player has been too brutal and drawn too much attention to the offices of Floor 13, the player character will be murdered.

There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.[CR]The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.",

The central puzzle in the game is the Sun's Map, which is a large map presented in several pieces that must be reassembled. Along with the map, there is a story that describes the fool's journey through the world that contains several clues as to the map's layout. It is also the key to most of the puzzles in the game, and players will have to switch between the map, story, and one or more puzzles several times in order to complete the game.[CR]The game is available for Amiga, Mac, or PC as a free download.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Sun's Map[CR]The following is a sample of some of the in-game story:[CR]One sunny day, a lighthearted Fool strolled along a hilly path, whistling a merry tune. A long wooden pole was slung over his shoulder and attached to it was a cloth bundle which carried his life\u2019s possessions.[CR]\u201cWhat a marvelous afternoon!\u201d he exclaimed to no one in particular, pausing to appreciate the lovely countryside.[CR]Soon the trees parted and the path led to a small clearing, ending abruptly at the edge of a treacherous cliff. But the Fool was undaunted and kept at his swift pace, steadily approaching the sheer drop.[CR]Additional pieces of the story become unlocked as more puzzles are solved. Once every puzzle is completed, the entire story can then be read from beginning to end.[CR]Sequel[CR]One of Many Puzzles[CR]On October 26th, 2012, Cliff Johnson (creator of The Fool's Errand) self-published The Fool and his Money, the direct sequel to The Fool's Errand, for Mac and PC.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frontier: Elite II was the sequel to the seminal Elite and furthered the ambition of an open ended space trading game. The sequel brought with it markedly improved physics and a realistically modelled galaxy. To augment the open-ended nature of the game the universe was procedurally generated and real sized planets despite there being little to explore on them.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Whilst no plot emerges during gameplay there is a plot present in the manual which sets the premise of the game. Fresh from victory in the Thargoid War during the original game humanity finds itself in crisis. With the Thargoids retreated to their own territory humanity has fallen into a cold war between the militaristic Federation and the slave owners of the Imperial Fleet. After a short war a tense ceasefire is in effect made worse by new anarchic systems taking advantage of the fear of military action by operating without law. You enter the world as always with 100 credits and a ship as the original protagonists grandchild, with no alliances to the factions and a chance to carve your own path in the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Changes from Elite[CR]Whilst Elite restricted you to one ship, Frontier: Elite II encouraged purchase of new ships to suit your style of play. Military vessels ranged from light fighter crafts to mammoth naval style crafts with trading crafts offering larger cargo space and mining crafts coming with specific mining lasers. Graphics are understandably improved with texture mapping and curved polygons moving the series from the simplistic wireframe style of the original.[CR] Factions[CR]The game has two primary factions which players may join. The Federation based on Earth and The Empire based in the Achenar system. Progress through both involved completing missions given at bases which allowed for promotions. The reality was that there was little gameplay difference between the two aside from the location of the base and how that would affect trade routes. The Empire was more permissive of slavery allowing for new trading opportunities whilst slavery was an arrestable offence in Federation territories. Certain ships were also designated as being independent, Federation or Empire ensuring they were out of bounds to those in an opposing faction. Finally upon joining a faction it locked off the enemies portion of space due to enemies becoming hostile upon spotting you.[CR] Control[CR]Unlike Elite, whose controls were arcade style, Frontier opted for a rigid Newtonian physics model making flight control and dogfights highly difficult. In moving momentum had to be considered as did gravitational pull. Whilst difficult this did offer emergent gameplay such as using planets to slingshot great distances (not programmed in but emergent through the physics model). This put control closer to a flight simulator than the arcades. Making gameplay approachable despite these difficulties was done in two ways. Firstly long distance travel is done by use of the hyperdrive which makes long distance travel extremely quick and day to day such as docking and navigating to positions for using the hyperdrive can be handed to the autopilot.[CR] Earning Credits[CR]The game starts you with one hundred credits and an Eagle Long Range Fighter, setting you loose on an open ended universe. As with Elite the game concerns engaging in legal or illegal trading to earn credits and advance in whatever fashion the player desires. The game revolves around finding the most profitable trading routes and running them to earn maximum credits. Trading can be done by simply purchasing from ports or by mining asteroids however the cost of a mining vessel does restrict that aspect of the game until later levels. Certain items are deemed illegal in various ports and planets (such as narcotics) with the reward of lucrative black market trading being offset by the risk of police intervention. Again though black market trading involves a certain amount of investment (life support for cargo bay to transport slaves for example) which limits it to a more advanced player. Beyond trading bounty hunting and military missions can both be highly profitable but come with inherent risks. Bounty hunting taking you into anarchic systems and to highly dangerous ships with military missions raising your rank by allying you to a faction and to a set of solar systems whilst making you unwelcome in others.[CR] Bugs[CR]Rushed for release in the UK for Christmas 1993 the game was filled with bugs. These ranged from inconsistencies between the booklet and the game (with regards to ship details) to incorrect prices paid for gems in the Cemiess system making trading there almost game-breakingly lucrative. The only bug which required a patch however was the \"mining glitch\" where attempting to leave equipment in a system ended in a crash. The most famous of bugs however is the wormhole bug which exploited a maths overflow in calculating hyperspace distances. In essence is the jump distance was exactly 655.36 light years the game would allow a jump regardless of ship capabilities. This was removed for the versions released after 1993 however it has made the freeware UK version the most popular. Moving away from bugs large portions of the game seemingly suffers from it's ambition by showing a lack of polish. Ships such as \"The Lion\" cannot handle having turrets installed as it simply fires into it's own wing and missiles being largely unable to damage crafts. Whilst minor there are instances of this lack of polish impacting strongly on gameplay as can be seen by the police AI being astonishingly poor resulting in police chases being impossible due to the police crafts crashing into each other almost instantly.[CR] Ships[CR]Interplanetary Shuttle[CR]Lifter[CR]Osprey[CR]Falcon[CR]Hawk Airfighter[CR]Kestrel Airfighter[CR]Eagle Mk.

A proposed modern iteration named Elite 4 was planned and down as being under development on the Frontier Developments website but was never shown. On November 5th 2012 Frontier Development launched a Kickstarter to help fund development of Elite: Dangerous, a sequel in the genre and spirit of the original games for release in 2014. The project achieved it's goal and raised over \u00a31.5 million in funding.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gateway to the Savage Frontier is the first game in the new Savage Frontier epic that would only span two volumes: this entry, and its sequel, Treasures of the Savage Frontier. It is part of SSI's Gold Box series set in the Forgotten Realms and using TSR's 2nd Edition AD&D rules. The Gold Box Engine that had been created for Pool of Radiance and then used with its subsequent sequels set on the shores of the Moonsea would also be used in this game, although it would also undergo several changes.[CR]Because it is based on the same engine behind SSI's Gold Box series of RPGs. only the setting has changed. This was planned as the first game in a series of titles to take place in an area of the Forgotten Realms known as the Savage Frontier.[CR]The most important change to the Gold Box engine with this game was the Wilderness map. By traveling outside of a civilized area, such as a city, a map would be displayed allowing the player to move party around on it. Random encounters were calculated by the game in this mode as they would be in the normal Adventuring mode.[CR]The game, based as it is on the Gold Box engine, continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, a tactical turn-based system was used to display the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]As this game was developed some time after the previous Gold Box titles were, it had also followed their lead in terms of its of copy protection by eschewing the cumbersome translation wheel that had been initially used.[CR]Upon starting, a verification question is shown which directed the player to find the indicated word answer in either the rule book (the manual) or the included Adventurer's Journal. The disks themselves did not have any copy protection allowing players to make copies and play on them instead.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructions and an outline of the rulesAn Adventurer's Journal going into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the gameA Quick Reference card for commands[CR]The city of Neverwinter had its debut in this game and become spun off into the first MMORPG using graphics through a partnership with AOL. Neverwinter Nights would launch in March of 1991 and players would be charged an hourly rate to play which would later change as Internet connection costs became cheaper. Prior to its release, such MMOGs were typically text based interfaces such as that found in MUDs.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]After successfully escorting a caravan to the far off city of Yatar and having been paid very well, the party quickly revels in their newfound wealth and celebrate. When they return to their inn to rest, they awaken to a grim discovery: they've been robbed. All that they have had has been stolen save for some coins and spellbooks stashed beneath their pillows.[CR]They quickly purchase new equipment to make up for their losses and run across a man in trouble in a corner of the town. Quickly dispatching the attacking bandits, the party befriends the man, named Krevish, who accompanies them on their journey in repayment of their deed. He also puts them in contact with a captain who alerts the group to a job that could pay well. An evil cleric needs to be taken care of and the party, out of luck and in need of coin, decide to do the job.[CR]Journeying to the frontier city of Nesme which is currently living in the aftermath of a recent power struggle, the adventurers ply their trade by hunting trolls for bounty or in trying to stay out of the way of the barbarians that had helped to overthrow the previous rulers. They discover the hidden temple and slay the cleric who uses the last of his strength to burn several papers that are quickly recovered.[CR]The papers outline a plot by Zhentil Keep, a city on the Moonsea and a well-known harbor for evil, to conquer the Savage Frontier. The cleric, a member of the Temple of Bane, would normally be on their side. But the Temple fears that this plan will throw the balance of power between the city and themselves into chaos and had resolved to stop it before it could bear fruit. Clues tell the party that the man was to meet with a contact in Silverymoon.[CR]Heading there, they discover that the town is in the midst of a festival celebrating the goddess, Mielikki, and find the person they are to contact. He tells them of a mage, Amanitas, only to discover that he has been kidnapped and has been taken to Everlund.[CR]There, they discover a hidden dungeon where he is held and free him after a great battle. He lays out the Zhentarim plan for them and tells them of four statues that figure into their design. Telling them of a Kraken Outpost in Yartar, he directs them to return and deal with the evil organization there that has a stake in the plan.[CR]They are tricked while exploring the city and dropped into the secret compound that they had been searching for. Vaalgamon, the Zhentarim general charged to oversee the plan, mocks them as they arrive and leaves the party for the Kraken's organization's thugs to take care of. The party proves more resourceful and manage to break through the trap, discovering more information in the process that leads them to cities along the Trackless Sea. Their first stop: Neverwinter.[CR]At Neverwinter, they ready for the journey further north to Port Llast where they search a haunted ship and discover clues pointing to the port city of Luskan. They arrive just in time for the captains of the city to receive their tribute from the local sea captains. They are forced to fight their way through pirate crews and make their way to the Hosttower of Luskan where a mage, Brinshaar, helps them enter to retrieve the statuette they hold.[CR]Brinshaar betrays them as they leave, but the party defeat him and continue on with the Company of the Brazen Pennant to the Island of Tuern. After many misadventures, they run afoul of the Kraken Society once again and fight through their headquarters there, seizing their statuette before they can put it on a ship and leave.[CR]They return to Neverwinter and take advantage of its unique shops, especially that of the local blacksmith who forges the meteoric ore that they had discovered during their adventuers in Tuern into a powerful sword. They make their way to the city of Secomber, Amanitas' home, where he directs them though Loudwater and then to the dwarven city of Llorkh.[CR]The party defeat the large band of Zhentarim at Loudwater who had hoped to ambush them and gain the alliance of a former Zhentarim Guard, Rishpal. Joining them, they head off to Llorkh.[CR]At a shop where they resupply themselves at, they are suddenly dropped down a chute and into an arena. Rishpal has betrayed them and joins Vaalgamon who is present to watch the party die as sport. The party once again prove to be far more tenacious than their enemies give them credit for and escape, befriending a half-orc named Muthtur, and by fighting through the passages beneath Llorkh, discover the third statuette.[CR]They return to Secomber and speak with Amanitas who directs them to the Star Mounts, a range of mountains. They make their way through the High Forest and help save a group of bird-like creatures called the aarakocra who inform them that they have seen a woman riding a dragon in the region. The aarakocra fly the group to her fortress and there, they fight the evil mage, Ceptienne, and take the fourth statue that she had held.[CR]The party journeys through Sundabar where Vaalgamon attempts to stop them several methods ranging from illusions to attacks by monsters. Surviving his tricks, they make their way to the ancient city of Ascore.[CR]In the distant past, the statuettes had once formed a powerful defensive measure to defend the city against monsters. Together and pointed at the four cardinal directions, they protected the city by causing any monster that approached it to grow weak, lethargic, and nauseous, making them easy to destroy by the defenders. Over time, monsters left the city alone. But the receding waters of the Narrow Sea had left the once mighty port as a part of the growing desert. Traders left along with its people, and in the end, the statuettes were ultimately taken away by the last to leave the city to its fate.[CR]And now, the Zhentarim intend to use the combined power of the statues by placing them in Ascore and pointing them across the Trackless Sea. This would enable the Zhentarim to freely invade the Savage Frontier without having to worry about the monsters, allowing them to surprise their enemies and conquer the region.[CR]It is at Ascore that the party faces the undead inhabitants of its former life as well as the forces arrayed against them by Vaalgamon who taunts them from within a maze of battles. But the party proves triumphant and by replacing the statues at the center of the city as they were meant to be, defeat the Zhentarim forces and escape back to Yartar as heroes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Gateway to the Savage Frontier is Volume One of the Savage Frontier series. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use with few changes outside of an entirely different campaign than that of its predecessor.[CR]As has become something of a convenient theme in the Gold Box series, the game starts the player's party off with the bare minimum of money with which they must purchase equipment and supplies with despite the implication that they are seasoned adventurers. In other titles, such as Curse of the Azure Bonds, this was used as a mechanic to balance imported characters against the starting challenges of the game.[CR]A vault is provided in the cities of Yartar, Silverymoon, and Neverwinter for the players to store extra equipment. A special \"card\" that allows them to deposit items remotely to any of these vaults is also given to the party later in the adventure.[CR]All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 2nd edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.Races[CR]Six races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world. This is a standard set provided across all of the Gold Box titles as well as titles such as Hillsfar.[CR]Players can also select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.[CR]The races did not undergo any significant changes and had been presented in the same way as before in Pool of Radiance:Dwarves: Excellent warriors and often considered the best blacksmiths within the Forgotten Realms, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Gnomes: These are treated as shorter and slimmer versions of dwarves in the game, although they tend to be a little better as thieves.Halflings: Resistant to magic and poison, they are about half the size of humans and can make decent fighters and thieves.Human: The most common race in the Forgotten Realms, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.[CR]The alignment system remains unchanged from its previous implementation in Pool of Radiance:Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Paladins - These are holy fighters whose faith gives them resistances to spells and poison. They can also turn undead creatures as a cleric can at two levels below their current level. They have an aura that repels evil much like a Protection from Evil spell. They also gain the ability to Cure Disease once a week and can heal themselves of two points of damage per day. They can also use cleric spells when they reach 9th level. However, they must be Lawful Good and have more attribute restrictions than a fighter does.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield.[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.Locations[CR]There is no Overworld map in this game, but New Verdigris has a number of locations that the players will find useful as they explore the valley:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an areaVault - The party can store extra equipment here as well as convert platinum coins into gems for the Well of Knowledge.Wilderness[CR]One large change to the game is the implementation of a wilderness travel mode. In this mode, when the player leaves a city or other suitably civilized area, a large overland map is displayed and the player can guide their progress using it. Random encounters were generated and tactical combat ensued.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.[CR]",

While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has an isometric kind of view.[CR]The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.",

Unlike other Koei games, which focus on China or Japan, Genghis Khan also allowed the player to interact with other parts of Asia as well as medieval Europe.[CR]The game progressed in two stages: Mongol conquest and world conquest.[CR]In either mode the game supports up to four players.[CR]In Mongol conquest the player takes the role of a Mongol chieftain attempting to rise through the ranks to become Genghis Khan.[CR]In world conquest each player attempts to conquer the old world and takes control of one of the following powers: the Mongols (led by Genghis Khan), the Byzantines (led by Alexios), the Britons (led by Richard) or the Japanese (led by Yoritomo).[CR]As players progress through either game, their leaders have children (who also age) and eventually grow ill and die. This generational gameplay makes choosing and training an heir important, since the player might need to control several different characters during the course of a single game.[CR]The character must also appoint governors to rule conquered kingdoms and these governors can rebel, forming independent nations that must be reconquered. The player can prevent a governor from rebelling by marrying a daughter to his general, effectively making that general an adopted brother.[CR]Genghis Khan was successful enough to warrant a sequel, Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Grey Wolf, which was released for the SNES and is available on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR]",

Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.",

[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Each scenario can only be completed by using the unique talents of each Goblin co-operatively.Ignatius - The 'engineer' of the group, Ignatius is the only character that can pick up, transport and manipulate objects. It could also be considered that he is the leader of the group because he safeguards the objects and does all the talking and bargaining.Oups - Oups is a magician. His talent is casting spells on objects. This either causes them to grow, new platforms or ladders to appear or transmutes the object into something different entirely. Misuse of his power usually results in something bad happening.Asgard - Asgard is the athlete and fighter. He is the only one that can climb and  can hit, push or pull objects. He has limits though, you can't expect him to take on monsters with his bare hands.The characters are identified by the names Dwayne, Hooter and BoBo in the   USA version of the manual, perhaps a misguided attempt to make the game less ' European'.[CR]",

It is the follow-up to Gobliiins, though it changes the protagonists and reduces their number from three to two. To compensate, many of the game's \"regions\" take up several screens and the puzzles require more elaborate teamwork to complete.[CR]Gobliins 2 stars two goblins: Fingus, an introvert who is intelligent, polite and good with machines; and Finkle, who is extroverted, vulgar and tends to resort to brute force. Both goblins react to different hotspots in the environment - buttons, NPCs and items - in different ways, and understanding how they differ in their approaches is key to solving the game's puzzles.[CR]The game was released for home computers in Europe in 1992. It was later added to mobile devices and to the catalog of digital distributor GOG in a bundle with the other two Gobliiins games.[CR]",

Playing badly will cause less enemies to appear and more bonuses to be awarded, while surviving for a long time might increase enemy aggression to compensate. Hercules can collect treasure and use it to buy useful power-up items from vendors accessible at the end of every area. Many enemies constantly respawn, so the player is recommended to move quickly through the maze-like stages, though some strategy is required due to the number of key puzzles to solve.[CR]Gods is scored by synth musician John Foxx, and the striking box art illustration (as seen on European versions of the game) was created by English comic book artist Simon Bisley.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,7,5,6 saying, \"...faithful to the original and even better as a SNES cart. The strategy aspect is a definite plus especially with the hidden rooms and intricate puzzles. The pseudo artificial intelligence for the skill level is cool and works quite well\".[CR]",

The game uses Sierra's AGI game engine, combining a graphical presentation with a text parser interface.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Players control Jerrod Wilson, a newspaper worker in Brooklyn Heights in 1848. As news of the discovery of gold in California spreads, Jerrod decides to risk it all and undertake the perilous journey west in search of fortune.Preparing for the journey.[CR]After selling his house and securing supplies in New York, the player chooses one of three paths through the game: traveling overland, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or sailing around Cape Horn. The journey is reminiscent of The Oregon Trail, as the player must avoid death from horrible diseases, starvation, and/or killer ants.[CR]Upon arriving in California, you can wander the wilderness around Sacramento, panning for gold in streams. Eventually, you will find notes left by your brother, leading you to a perilous cave. The final challenge is to venture inside, where -- if you survive -- you may find the mother lode and be rewarded with more gold than you dreamed possible.[CR]Availability[CR]Gold Rush is apparently still available for purchase directly from the MacNeill brothers' company The Software Farm. According to the company's website, customers can purchase the game in a collector's edition that includes a poster-sized map and comes in a handmade wooden box. The website depicts the game being offered on 3.5 inch floppy discs; it is unknown whether other physical media formats are currently available.[CR]The game was also released on Steam in 2014.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Golden Axe is side-scrolling hack and slash game developed by Sega and released in 1989 as an arcade game. It was later ported to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, as well as a few other platforms including Xbox Live Arcade on July 11, 2007.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]An evil being known as Death Adder has taken over the once peaceful land called Yuria. Having murdered many innocent people, he also captured the king and his daughter. Death Adder's coup de gr\u00e2ce was finding the magical emblem of the land, the Golden Axe. And unless the people of Yuria accept him as the land's new king, he promises to destroy it.[CR]Starting the game requires players to select one of three characters, each of which is filled with revenge. While all three share the same goal of saving the king and his daughter, and stopping Death Adder from destroying the Golden Axe, each one has individual ambitions as well.[CR]Gilius Thunderhead - a battleaxe-wielding dwarf whose twin brother was killed by Death Adder's henchmen. His heart is filled with hate for the evil being.[CR]Ax Battler - a barbarian who wields a two-handed broadsword, his desire to stop Death Adder fueled by the hatred he feels for him, because the evil being killed his mother.[CR]Tyris Flare - a longsword-wielding amazon, she wants revenge on Death Adder for the murder of both of her parents.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Story mode[CR]To advance through the game, players must fight through swarms of Death Adder's henchmen, including mace-wielders, giants, and barbarians riding dragons and other mythical creatures. Killing a henchman mounted on one of these creatures affords players the opportunity to ride it as well.[CR]Players possess the ability to cast magic spells, which require magic potions obtained by kicking small, strange-looking thieves. More magic potions equal more devastating magical attacks. Picking up meat by kicking thieves helps recover lost health on the health bar.[CR]It is also possible to play through the game cooperatively with a second player.Duel mode[CR]Duel mode was implemented in many of the ports, but it was never included in the original arcade version. In Duel mode, players must fight through a number of small stages. Each stage has a handful of enemies to defeat. Defeat all the enemies to advance to the next stage.[CR]Duel mode can be played with two players, but it changes the goal entirely. The two players will have to fight each other to see who is crowned best warrior.[CR]Port Differences[CR]The Genesis is considered the most faithful port, visually and gameplay-wise. The DOS port for PCs is based directly on the Genesis port, and is almost as faithful in terms of aesthetics when playing in VGA mode.[CR]When the game was ported to the Genesis, Sega added one extra level that takes place right after the players defeat Death Adder. Where the arcade version ends right then and there, in the Genesis version, the large dungeon doors in the background of the level open and the characters walk inside. The final level takes place in this dungeon, after which the players face a new final boss called Death Bringer.[CR]As mentioned prior, Duel Mode was a new addition to the Genesis port of the game.[CR]In the Genesis port, when enemies are defeated, they flash and disappear as opposed to turning to stone.[CR]Some of the more graphics-intensive varieties of spell effects did not make it over to the home ports of the game. For instance, when Ax Battler is carrying his maximum capacity of potions, the spell he unleashes in the arcade version features a mushroom cloud emanating from the floor with huge rocks erupting towards the screen. In the DOS version, this high-level spell merely looks like a series of small eruptions scattered around the screen. The Genesis version aims to replicate the spell more effectively, but the rocks are smaller and they spit out to the side rather than scaling towards the screen.[CR]",

The player takes the role of Ch\u00e9 Guevara, best known for his role during the Cuban revolution, with the goal to conquer the city La Paz. The game is mostly menu based (with some digitised pictures thrown in) where the player commands the 15 revolutionaries. The available options are resting, moving through Bolivia, consulting maps to get an idea where to go, training to increase the statistics of the troops, defending (helps the odds when government troops attack) or sending out scouts. Most important is the food supply which can be either obtained by buying it (when in a village) or hunting (the success depends on the region). If it gets scarce, the player can ration it - but this has negative effect on the combat performance. Ambushes are either calculated automatically or, if it is lead by Guevara, plays out as a first-person action sequence. Here the player moves a crosshair over the screen and shoots popping out enemies.",

Eventually, the Vietnam War ends, and the player character must use their gunboat skills to take on drug cartels in Colombia as well as patrol the Panama Canal.[CR]The game is a strict simulation game, employing first-person views for the boat's navigation and weapons. The player can also assign weapon loadouts before each mission.[CR]Gunboat was originally developed for the Amstrad CPC by Accolade in 1990, before being released for the Commodore Amiga and PC IBM. It eventually saw a TurboGrafx-16 release in 1992, which was developed by The Code Monkeys and published by NEC Interchannel in the US exclusively.[CR]",

Players can choose to fly single, one-off missions or take part in an ongoing campaign in a theater of their choice, either in Eastern  Europe in a hypothetical conflict between NATO and the Soviet Union, or in the Persian Gulf to take part in the historical Operation Desert Storm.  Players start their career as a warrant officer, flying a lone helicopter in missions against either fixed targets or vehicles, usually tanks, on the move. Missions feature a primary objective, a secondary objective, a home base, and occasionally a FARP (forward arming refuel point,) where they could land and stock up on ammo and fuel. Most missions were of a search and destroy nature, but occasionally pick up and deliver missions were ordered. If players did well enough on their first few missions, they were offered the chance to be promoted to the commissioned rank of 2nd lieutenant.   Once this happened, players were accompanied in missions by a flight of wingmen. The flight consisted of six helos, total. One heavy flight, which contained four helos, and an additional light flight of two. Players could select aircraft and loadout for their flight, as well as issue orders to them in-flight. However, they executed their orders with varying degrees of competence. Often, they would attack low-priority targets with their best weapons, or, unload a barrage of high-powered weapons upon a target which the player already attacked with a missile in-flight. Even so, swooping in with a mix of six well-armed helos was more effective than going it alone.  The game featured adjustable realism settings. They also had to deal with environmental effects such as ground cover, which is ideal for helicopters to attack from, wind effects, and temperature. Lower air temperatures allow aircraft to carry heavier loads, in general, so players flying campaigns in Europe could typically load heavier ordnance than players trying to fight it out in the desert. Further, European maps typically had more terrain features to hide behind, making the European campaigns generally easier than desert ones.  Players could chose from a wide array of helicopters and armaments, some of which were in use at the time, and some of which were under development. The list includes:  AH-1T Cobra AH-64A Apache  AH-64D Apache Longbow (in development at the time)OH-58 Kiowa MD 500 Defender UH-60 Blackhawk RAH-66 Comanche Warrior (in development at the time, later canceled)RAH-66 Comanche Scout (in development at the time, later canceled)[CR]",

Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information.  This game puts the player in the shoes of a Corps commandera man responsible for several divisionsfor the lives of thousands of men.  The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader.[CR]In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.[CR]Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine.  Out in the field, their duty is to carry out orders to the best of their ability.  They must try to cope with the unexpected that interferes with their progressweather, enemies, terrain, fatigue, lack of supplies... Unfortunately, it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the command centers. Commanders don't have a personal connection to each person under them.  They rely on those underneath them to report in...[CR]This game gives some insight to the problems of command.  There are hundreds of units to keep track of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized.  The units become symbols on a map-board.  Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player sends out.  Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control.  Will they be able or willing to follow orders exactly?  What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by weather, by terrain.  Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a division (thousands of men) to their deaths?[CR]Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command centers, where the orders that they must follow come from.  This game recreates the command center.",

Harlequin must find them and mend the heart in the clock tower which lies at the center of the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of traveling across the landscape via running and jumping, while enemies are dispatched by spraying hearts at them. Many of the levels also feature puzzles which must be solved. The game is not linear in the typical platformer fashion; instead of running through a level from start to finish in order to proceed to the next, switches are scattered across the gameworld which open and close various paths between the game's levels. Careful exploration is required to figure out how to progress and where to go each time. Backtracking to previously visited levels is also sometimes vital.[CR]One of the game's more interesting features is a big level dedicated to parodying the Super Mario Bros. games, filled with objects that smile at the player and look eerily out of place when compared to some of the other levels.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game received rave reviews from enthusiast magazines at the time of release, but the lackluster sales prevented it from ever getting a sequel.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Harlequin's music was composed by Barry Leitch.[CR]",

At certain points AFTER player decisions, a symbol denoting a crossroads sign will appear.  This tells the player that if they had chosen differently, there would be different consequences to their actions.  This allowed for multiple endings, but at the same time if you didn't save frequently, you might be forced to replay a good portion of the game in order to see where the other branch led should you be blindsided with the choice and its consequences.Action sequences included melee combat atop a speeding train, as well as trying to drive a tank away from the villains' fortress without crashing it, while defending you and your companions from hostile forces.[CR]",

Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. [CR]Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.[CR]The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.[CR]When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.[CR]The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).[CR]Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.",

Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs, even a Thieves Guild, except a strong, brave hero that would protect it. Are you interested?[CR]Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero is an adventure/RPG hybrid. Visually very similar to other Sierra's \"quest\" titles (Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, and others), but the gameplay, beside the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and solving an occasional puzzle, involves real-time combat and character development. You can play the game as either a fighter, a mage, or a thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. You develop your skills by fighting, practicing, climbing, throwing, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to successfully complete the game. You interact with the game world by typing commands or conversation topics.",

Telling the stories of eight heroes as they traverse across the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, the game pits players against various enemies leading up to a confrontation with the ancient dragon Khisanth who holds the Disks of Mishakal, an ancient and powerful relic. It is the first in a series of three games developed by U.S. Gold under the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons name.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Differing drastically from Dungeons & Dragons games from the past, Heroes of the Lance's central focus is on side-scrolling action as opposed to role-playing. Although the game would use relevant statistics, spells and rules from the official tabletop game, a difficult to use graphical interface and severe limitation on character use (forcing players to control one at a time, thus limiting creativity) meant that this arcade-like style of gameplay would be short lived for the series as fans rallied against the switch.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionPortraitGoldmoonA human cleric betrothed to Riverwind.

The screen is split into 4 parts (or 3 in case 3 players play together), each one representing the viewpoint of the characters, these being selected from a team of 12 available mercenaries.[CR]If one player plays alone, he will control all 4 characters, using the mouse to navigate between each character viewpoints. A follow mode is available to avoid tedious numerous amounts of clicking when moving several characters. If two players play together, then each player will use a mouse to control two characters.[CR]In three or four-player mode, players can freely choose to control their characters via either a joystick/joypad or some of the predefined keyboard layouts or a mouse. When 4 people play together, the screen will display 4 viewpoints, like in 1 and 2-player modes. In 3-player mode, the top of the screen displays two viewpoints for player 1 and 2, but the lower part of the screen displays a single viewpoint, centered, for player 3.[CR]Three game modes are available.[CR]The Training mode features 5 simple maps on which the player(s) can learn how to move, use inventory items etc...[CR]The Full Campaign mode takes the player(s) to the far reaches of the Luyten planetary system, on the planet Graveyard. Battling through more than 20 theaters of engagement, your team of mercenaries test their limits of military prowess in order to wipe out all threats on the planet surface. To this end, they have to make their way through the different missions and gather 4 fusion power core rings, before entering the final mission in the Spaceport.[CR]Finally, in Short Action game mode, the player(s) can choose between 17 maps. On those maps, the player(s) will have to fight some enemies to reach the exit within a specified time limit. Additionally, when more than one player takes part in the mission, players will compete with each other since only the first to reach the exit will win.",

The game also has you assume the roles of other characters in the storyline, leading players to use the \"Who am I\" command to find out who they are playing as. It also has an in-game version of The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, which you can consult for information on numerous topics in the book/game universe.Feelies[CR]As with many Infocom titles the game came with \"feelies\", items that served the duel purpose of immersing the player in the game, as well as a form of copy-protection as there were some puzzles in the game that made you look at the items to get the answer. The \"feelies\" that came with HHGttG were:a \"Dont Panic\" pin (printed in large, friendly letters, of course)a small plastic packet containing \"pocket fluff\"order for the destruction of Arthur Dent's Housean order for the destruction of the Planet Earth(written in \"Vogon\")a \"Microscopic Space Fleet\"\"Peril Sensitive Sunglasses\" (an opaque pair of black cardboard sunglasses which you were told to put on to shield yourself from the peril of your final score)How Many Times Has This Happened To You? a brochure for The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxyno teaDifficulty[CR]This game has become infamous for its ferocious difficulty. There were several puzzles in the game that helped it earn this status. One of them was the \"Babel Fish Dispenser\" puzzle, in which a player had to place objects around a room to cause a Babel Fish to land in his ear. Failure to complete this puzzle did not kill the player, but rendered the game unwinnable due to not having the fish to translate alien languages. Later in the game the player had to unjam a hatch on the starship Heart Of Gold, which required one of the ten tools scattered throughout the game world. If the player did not manage collect all ten, the game was programmed to ask for one of the tools you did not have. Despite the many difficult sections of this game, it was still only listed as \"Standard\" difficulty by Infocom's rating system.[CR]This classic text adventure game has since been remade as a free flash 20th Anniversary Edition available here.[CR]",

The NES version is different than all the other versions.[CR]NES Version[CR]Robber hit by trap.[CR]The premise of Home Alone for the NES is to survive 20 minutes against two burglars from the movie - the \"Wet Bandits\" Harry and Marv. Kevin can do this by hiding behind certain objects, or picking up trap blocks. The trap blocks represent a certain trap via a picture, but they all do the same thing: knock the pursuing burglar out for a short amount of time. Traps can be set anywhere in- or outside the house. After a few uses the traps break. The game also shows the player a map of where they set up traps, however it does not show where the burglars are. After 20 minutes are up the game cuts to an image of the robbers being taken away by the cops.[CR]",

Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back.[CR]It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.",

While dodging enemy fire, you can pass through tunnels and collect fuel capsules. At the end of each level you can visit a shop to upgrade your hydroplane.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released for the Atari Lynx, Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 7,7,6,7, adding, \"...a standard race and chase game that does not offer too much in the wat of innovation. It is kind of fun and the challenge is there, but it did not keep my interest for very long\".[CR]",

[CR]The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard, fist-sized cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman  if he or she does not get out  may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the \"non-striker\"), who has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more runs.[CR]Choosing between a bowler, or a batsman, game player defines the role of its team. During the match game player may control all his team players, nearest to the ball to achieve the main goal. Power, direction, and the moment should be used properly to achieve it more successfully.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Inventory Screen (Amiga)[CR]The game follows an apprentice who discovers a message in a puff of smoke from an enchanted candle from the Wizard Mordamir who is trapped in the dungeon far below and counting on Dunric to save him. Continuing further in the dungeon, the apprentice encounters goblins, trolls, and all manner of traps and monsters. While sleeping on straw, he dreams of an ancient city a thousand years old with water and young people everywhere. On his way through the dungeon he frees Ana, Dunric's daughter. Then the apprentice learns that the ancient city was a place where waters from the Fountain of Youth would flow from goblins who ask for his help in distracting The Norlac, a sort of water monster, in the canals below. Through another dream, he learns of an ancient peaceful civilization of dragons guarding the Fountain of Youth. Using his wits, the apprentice tricks the monster into falling into a whirlpool, but then he also is sucked in. Barely surviving the event, the wizard presses forth and has another dream. This time it's about the ancient city's council members and wizards gathering together and planning a siege, and then flashes of battles between wizards and dragons. By now he is nearing the bottom of the dungeon, and at the bottom he discovers one dragon survived the war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Magic Carpet ride (DOS)[CR]The Immortal has a lot of item-based puzzle solving, lots of deadly enemy encounters, tons of traps, and requires patience to survive. At times the game is unforgiving, wherein if you use items before they're required or in the wrong place the game will make it impossible to proceed. Sometimes the traps will be inanely difficult to proceed through, such as the infamous \"Worm Room\". Thankfully each level is short, so if you survive through it all you can record the \"certificate\" (what The Immortal calls its passwords) and continue playing another time. Combat in this game is either about entirely avoiding enemies, or going to a combat screen where the idea is to dodge until you build up your stamina and then start slashing the enemies to bits with your sword. There are several spell scrolls to pick up, and at one point even a magic spellbook that allows you to cast a minor fireball spell infinitely. The game also has certain points where you can float around to avoid the giant worms and tiny spiders such as the magic carpet and the levitation spell. This mechanic feels the same each time, as it's almost like controlling a car that can constantly accelerate, but the controls are quite horrendous and it's hard to survive these segments, as well as the one later in the game with the creature in the water canals while riding a barrel.[CR]The game has a few alternate endings with minor detail differences, based upon actions earlier in the game.DeathDueling the giant Spider Queen (DOS)[CR]In \"The Immortal\", there are so many ways to die, and many ways to kill. When fighting goblins and trolls, the apprentice can decapitate them, slice them in half at the waist, and from the head to the groin, make their heads explode, cause them to turn to ashes, and skin them alive. The apprentice himself can be consumed by slimes, body slammed and eaten by giant worms that burst through the ground, fall through trap doors, get stepped on during a shrink spell, use an amulet that causes him to die instantly, fed upon by a giant Queen Spider, and can be eaten alive by hundreds of tiny spiders.[CR]Alternate Versions[CR]Level 6[CR]The sixth level of the game only appears in certain versions of the title. It features the giant spider Queen and the tiny spider sacks that when touched will overwhelm the apprentice with dozens of spiders that eat him alive. The level also features a brief portion where the wizard can acquire some alcohol, and either drink it or use it to solve a puzzle. Drinking the alcohol would actually intoxicate the player, and make every direction the apprentice would walk in completely random.Amount of Gore[CR]The PC and Genesis/Mega Drive versions of this game had a markedly different level of gore during finishing moves in battle. Most of the gory deaths were absent from the PC version, while the Genesis/Mega Drive version had bloody eviscerations which were all kinds of awesome.[CR]",

The nobs of the Reform Club force him to bet all he owns: 20.000 GBP. Together with your Butler Passepartout you set off on 2nd October to your great adventure. [CR]Half the time of the game you play as Phileas Fogg, half the time as Butler Passepartout. The screen shows a world map, a puffing train in the corner indicates the speed level you travel, a money bag indicates your finances and 2 buttons exist where you can bribe (to speed up the train) and play cards (to increase your financials). Action parts are arcade-styled, normally side-scrolling platform-action in which you have to collect items for your further travel. The first action-adventure parts starts in India, where you  control Passepartout running through the Jungle to a temple where you have to collect something for your further adventures.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Incredible Crash Dummies (known as \"The Incredible Crash Dummies: Slick Bouya no Daichousen\" in Japan. The subtitle roughly translates as \"Slick's Great Challenge\") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.[CR]The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. [CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.Levels (Dummy Stunts)[CR]Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The Roof Jump comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.[CR]The Air Bumper stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.[CR]The Ski Slope tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.[CR]The Dummy proceeds to enter the Bomb Factory, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.[CR]The Cruise Missle stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.[CR]After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, \"...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things\".[CR]",

This marks the first time multiple paths were featured in a LucasArts adventure game. The three different routes each involve different gameplay and different endings.[CR]This game was an unlockable game mode in the 2009 Wii game Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings. The game can be played on modern PCs using ScummVM.[CR]A sequel was in the works, but it was cancelled and the story was reworked into two separate comics published by Dark Horse.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The interior of Barnett College.[CR]Indiana Jones is asked to retrieve a strange idol from Barnett College, where he teaches. The man who asked Indy to find the artifact turns out to be Klaus Kerner, a Nazi agent. Klaus steals the idol and draws Indy into an adventure to uncover what it is the Nazis are after.[CR]In his search, Indy teams up with Sophia Hapgood, an old colleague who is also a target of Kerner because of the necklace she wears: an artifact that will help them uncover the final resting place of Atlantis. It is after meeting with Sophia that Indy learns of what the Nazis want with Atlantis and the power they would obtain if they were ever to get hold of a mineral called orichalcum.[CR]Another key to finding Atlantis, Indy learns, is in the legendary Lost Dialogue, a book of disputed existence by Plato. The story continues to unfold depending on which path the player chooses to take.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The general gameplay is set out like a traditional point and click adventure game. There are many puzzles, but the game also includes optional combat. In many situations a problem can be solved using puzzle solving, but sometimes the player can optionally solve a dispute with a fist fight.Paths[CR]The game includes three distinct paths that the player can take. Each path includes different objects that the player can interact with, locations, and dialogue. The three paths are:Wits: A path with many puzzle solving elements.Fists: Fewer problems but with more fighting scenes.Team: The path that relies more heavily on Sophia Hapgood in some of the puzzles.Indy Quotient[CR]As the player progresses they are rewarded with Indy Quotient (IQ) points. To receive the maximum 1,000 points the player will have to play through every path and see every alternative ending. In order to achieve this, the player must play through the game a minimum of three times.[CR]Steam Re-Release[CR]In 2009, Lucasarts re-released the game for the price of $4.99 on Steam.[CR]",

Most of the screen is used for a visual rendition of the current scene. At the bottom of the screen are words, which can be clicked on using the mouse to activate their functions. For example, objects can be picked up, used, pushed or pulled, and turned on and off. Most locations are from the movie, but some further scenes are added.[CR]In keeping with Indiana's action-man persona, the game also features pure action scenes.

The practice mode can be used for training on the drive or putting or play an eighteen hole course against up to three other human players. The tournament mode consists of a total of 65 golfers and is played over up to four rounds. Up to four of the golfers can be controlled by humans, the rest are computer controlled. The head to head mode is played by one human versus one computer player.The game is played with mouse control and all actions are accessed through menu gadgets. The functionality available from these include choosing from different clubs (fourteen in total; woods, irons, wedges and a putter), setting direction, setting power, picking a shot type (chip, normal or punch), viewing the green, and finally hitting the ball. Upon clicking on the hit button a swing-o-meter appears, showing a marker going back and forth. By clicking, the marker stops and if it's then to the left of the centre the ball will hook, if it is to the right it will slice. Once the player has managed to reach the green the gadgets will be replaced with three others that control putting: display gradient markers, set directions and hit ball.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]It Came From The Desert is an adventure/strategy game developed by Cinemaware and released in 1989 for the Amiga and later ported to various other platforms. Set in June of 1951, the game follows Greg Bradley, a geologist living in the remote town of Lizard Breath in the United States. After a meteorite falls in the outskirts of town, a large army of mutant-ants begin appearing across town and the player is the only one who can stop it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Ants![CR]It Came From The Desert is a non-linear adventure game with elements of strategy, action and horror. The game is successful in creating a haunting atmosphere, where the player won't know what will happen next. There are multiple ways to play the game with many different endings, both good and bad. Each scene can branch off into an entirely different story path, depending on the player's actions and thus multiple playthroughs are required to see everything the game has to offer.[CR]The player moves from location via an overworld map, each trip taking a certain amount of time depending on the distance. The game plays out in real-time, with each second equating a minute in-game. In certain situations, the game allows the player to travel across the town of Lizard Breath in a top-down perspective, from flying planes to access the ant army or even driving a tank. The game features day/night cycles, with some locations and story triggers only available at certain parts of the day. For example, a player can choose to meet a reporter who will require him to be at the town's quarry at 10 AM, failure to arrive at the specified date will effectively end that sidestory. This requires the player to keep track of all their tasks, as no in-game journal exists.[CR]When the player encounters an ant, the game enters a first-person perspective shootout, where the player must shoot off the ant's antennae. This mode is very intense, and there is little room for error, as the player's gun has a limited amount of ammo and only several seconds to react. If the player is incapacitated, they will end up in the hospital. There are several other ways to end up in the hospital, from crashing their car, exposure to smoke, or sexual exhaustion (yep). The player can choose to accept treatment, which can be from one day to several, or escape. The player can attempt to escape the hospital by making their way down to the ground level, which involves a top-down mini-game where the player must use stealth, such as hiding in beds or in rooms as well as using wheelchairs to outrun doctors, nurses and guards. If the player is caught, they are strapped down and they have no choice but to accept recovery, losing precious days of gametime. Lizard's Breath is a lonely place.[CR]Throughout the game, the town will progressively succumb to the ant invasion if the player fails to act against the ants. Ants will start to appear throughout town, buildings will be deserted and some of the townsfolk will begin to transform into mutant ants. The player has just 15 days to repel the ant invasion. In order to do so, the player must first find sufficient evidence to convince the Mayor of the threat. The player can find clues from townsfolk, such as liquid trails or tissue samples. One piece of evidence requires the player to fly a cropduster with a built in sound recorder over the ants and record their sounds. The player can also get evidence from Ants themselves if they successfully disable them, but this is far riskier. When the player finds evidence, he must take it to the town's University Lab, where it can take several days to compile results. If the player has more than one sample of evidence, this time is significantly reduced.[CR]When enough evidence is found and the Mayor is convinced of the threat, the player is put in charge of mobilizing a defense at the town's police department. This brings up the Situation Map, where the player can allocate the army, police, construction and townsfolk to the town's various locations to aid in fending off the ants. Each unit has a special trait: Army units will deploy tanks to battle ants and construction workers can repair buildings destroyed by the ants. The Situation Map must be checked frequently to find out where ants are coming from, so the player can move units to that location. The player can also take the fight to the ants themselves, which can be far more effective and less resource-intense, but can still be far riskier. In order to drive them off, the player must first defeat an initial ant in a shootout then defeat ants in the area using grenades. When the army has been drawn back, the player must find the location of the ant's nest, enter and plant a bomb and escape, destroying the source of the ant army and saving Lizard Breath.[CR]Genesis version[CR]A version of It Came from the Desert was produced for the Genesis/Mega Drive but scrapped due to a game-breaking glitch. In 2014, Cinemaware announced that it was working with retro developer Watermelon to fix the glitch and finally release the Genesis version on cartridge.[CR]",

Core Design acquired the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.[CR]Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.[CR]The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.",

They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.[CR]As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat. This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field support officer to assign missions. The plan is that you will \"borrow\" aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School.[CR]In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your \"borrowed\" aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains.[CR]Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like Brderbunds Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstike its possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.",

The action consists of walking across a horizontally-scrolling backdrop, and shooting of the enemy as they appear. Point, Time and Life bonuses can be found along the way, and Jim's considerable armaments (mostly guns) can be enhanced, too. These bonuses are held in small pods which float in the air. When shot, they drop both bonus points and a useful add-on, which include extra lives, smart bombs or a shield \u2013 however, the latter is relatively useless and lasts mere seconds before evaporating.[CR]There are five levels to be explored, each of which is nearly fifty screens long, and involve leaping across moving platforms and ramps and overcoming other similar obstacles. Simple as this sounds, though, the sheer number of enemy sprites thrown at you make it a frustrating and thankless task. The jump 'n' shoot action is nicely paced and unrelenting, with lots of stuff to kill, collect and negotiate. Jimbo himself is very controllable and the only bugbear is that he doesn't fire when he's running.[CR]",

Joe, the green haired caveman, and Mac the blue haired one, can fight rival cavemen, deadly dinosaurs and crack open eggs all in the name of rescuing the damsels in distress. Their primary attack is a melee club attack, but can be upgraded by finding weapons upgrades that are often trapped inside of eggs throughout the levels.[CR]Joe & Mac features an overworld map after each level, allowing the player to use alternate paths to complete the game.[CR]The game was noted at the time for its challenging gameplay, unique setting and theme, cartoony graphics and light-hearted music.[CR]The NES version featured five levels with some higher than average backgrounds and character sprites compared to other games for the system.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]The NES version of the game was awarded the following scores from Electronic Gaming Monthly: 6,6,6,5. From the review, \"...Joe & Mac is a very good game given the limitations of the system. Although the game is short and a bit on the easy side, the younger audience will thoroughly enjoy this version\".[CR]",

Players command a variety of aircraft and ground units in order to stop Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike and Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, who threaten the United States with nuclear weapons.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays from an isometric perspective and is broken down into specific missions that need to be accomplished on each level. These range from attacking certain locations to defending objectives. Should any of the objectives result in a failure, the player must restart the level from the beginning. Before each level, players choose a co-pilot to help them, which gives the players semi-automatic to automatic fire on the machine guns. During the missions, fuel, ammunition, and armor all  factor into the gameplay. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike, plots his revenge against the United States by allying himself with Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, and announces his domiance by dropping a nuke on an island somewhere in the Pacific. STRIKE quickly send their top agent to secure the President and the surrounding D.C. area against terrorist attack. After securing the President, STRIKE moves to nullify Kilbaba's nuclear capability and control of specific regions. Being pushed back to the mountains, Kilbaba and the Drug Lord put up a strong resistance in their fortress, but are captured and taken back to the United States. However, both are able to escape following an attack on the Capitol. In the end, Kilbaba's escape in a gasoline truck is cut short and the Drug Lord is presumed dead after attempting to flee in a bus. With both leaders out of commission and a nuclear crisis averted in Washington D.C., the world is once again safe from fanatical leaders.[CR]",

Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.[CR]Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.[CR]There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets. [CR]Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These \"extras\" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.[CR]As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.[CR]Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers. [CR]Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor. Early in the game, he is allowed to hit so much wildlife before he loses a life, but as he progresses through each level, he can't afford to be hit not even once. Some levels in the game are quite tricky. Some levels require him to race through the level under a very strict time limit, while others contain a huge destruction target and he can't afford to miss any of these targets.[CR]The game uses a password system, that allows you to resume at the start of each level. In terms of the gameplay, one of the cheats say it all.",

                "plot": "On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle.  When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared!  Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears.  He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.[CR]King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the \"Walk\" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the \"Eye\" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing \"Look at\".  The \"Hand\" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The \"Head\" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.[CR]As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a 1992 point-and-click adventure game, developed and published by Sierra On-line. It is the sixth instalment of the King's Quest franchise, all designed by Roberta Williams; however, King's Quest VI was the first title in the series to be co-written, as Sierra newcomer Jane Jensen joined Williams to develop the game.[CR]In 2006, King's Quest VI was featured by Gamespot in its ongoing article series, \"The Greatest Games of All Time\".[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]King's Quest VI follows the adventures of Prince Alexander of Daventry. The game starts with a cinematic depicting Alexander pining for the girl he met briefly at the end of the previous game. After seeing a vision of the girl in his father's magic mirror, he realizes that he can find her by using the stars he saw outside her window. So he sets sail to find his potential romantic interest. Of course, a storm brews up and his ship sinks.[CR]Conveniently enough, he washes up on the shore of the island where his objective resides. At this point, the cinematic ends and the game begins.[CR]The setting of the game is The Land of the Green Isles, a small collection of islands in the middle of a very rough patch of ocean. The turbulent and stormy waters surrounding the islands makes travel between them difficult at the best of times. The isolation between the islands plays heavily into the plot of the game, and Alexander soon finds himself embroiled in misunderstandings born from the islands' limited communication with each other. The game came with an instruction booklet called \"The Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\", detailing the fictitious account of a sailor marooned on the island much as the protagonist is. It reads far more like a storybook than a game manual, and the traditional copyright information is subtly hidden within the content.[CR]King's Quest VI was written and produced by Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen. This is the first time in the King's Quest series that anyone other than Roberta Williams had a major hand in the creative vision.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is largely typical for a Sierra-developed point-and-click adventure game. The game was originally designed for DOS, but was made compatible with Windows before release. The screen graphics between the two versions are identical, but the Windows version does feature a sharper and cleaner-looking user interface, as well as better cursor sprites. About a year after the game was initially released, Sierra re-issued a talkie upgrade version on CD-ROM (at the time it was released, CD-ROM had still not been widely adopted, and were considered rare for PC games). This upgraded version featured full voice acting throughout, and Sierra re-drew all of the character profiles in high resolution to accompany the new vocal track. The re-drawn profiles were animated using lip-sync technology that Sierra had acquired from Bright Star, an edutainment software house they had recently purchased.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]In the Cthulhu Mythos, the \"Mad Arab\" alchemist, Abdul Alhazred, is the creator of the Necronomicon.[CR]",

When playing alone there are four AI enemies to defeat and three additional human players can also join in. Everyone starts with one province and a starting budget. Money is used to buy troops or build defenses in a owned province and is earned through taxes. Troops can be divided and stationed in different provinces.When fights occur, there are two possibilities: a quick or a detailed mode. In the quick mode there are only a few basic decisions to take and the outcome mostly depends on the number of units and statistical factors. In the detailed mode, the player manually controls troop movements and sets catapult goals. Every six months there is a archery tournament, which plays out as mini game with manual aiming in first-person, with money as reward.",

It is very similar to the games of the Captive series, as it was developed by the same author. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the Dungeon Master one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with \"stab\", \"swing\" and \"hack\". A empty hand shows a menu with \"punch\" and \"kick\". The wand shows a list of available spells.[CR]The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.",

The player controls Jack Slater, an LA police detective that must beat up hordes of thugs in order to progress through each of six stages. Most of the gameplay consists of repetitive fights against a few different types of enemies, using a very limited number of attacks. The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.[CR]The game was released on multiple home systems. There are three discrete versions from different developers:The Bits Studios release, which is a brawler that lacks a depth of field (similar to early games in the genre, like Vigilante) and features a couple of action stages where Slater must chase down enemies via his convertible. It was released on the SNES and Genesis, and both versions are largely identical save for a few graphical and gameplay tweaks. There's also a much more compact variant for the Game Boy and Game Gear.The Teeny Weeny Games release for the NES. This is a much more standard brawler, like Double Dragon. The stages have entirely different layouts, and even includes a stage based on a dream sequence in the movie where the main character re-imagines Hamlet as an explosive blockbuster.The Psygnosis release for MS-DOS and the Amiga. This is, again, a brawler with driving sequences, though the game looks and plays completely differently to the Bits Studios release. This version originally appeared on DOS several months after the home console versions, and was ported to the Amiga by The Dome Software.[CR]Last Action Hero received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls. In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as \"one of the worst SNES games ever made.\" A rundown of all the different versions of this game can be found on Hardcore Gaming 101.[CR] [CR]",

It is also one of the few C64 games on the Wii's Virtual Console, added in 2008 (Europe)/2009 (US).[CR]A Jaleco-published NES version (US only) was released as The Last Ninja, but this was in fact a port of the sequel Last Ninja 2.[CR]The game is depicted with an isometric viewpoint, and is somewhat open and dependent on adventure game style puzzles. The player is the eponymous last ninja, and is tasked with avenging his fallen clan.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Last Ninja takes place in a time when the strongest of the Japanese clans reaches the pinnacle of their decadent lifestyle. Appalled and oppressed, the peasants retreat into the mountains. Deep in the mountains they establish the secret art of the ninjutsu. Several centuries later they become the strongest and fiercest warriors of all Japan. Kunitoki, the merciless ruler of the Ashakagi Clan, envies their power and so takes an oath to achieve their total destruction. Once every decade all Ninja must travel to the Island of Lin Fen where they pay homage to the shrine of the White Ninja and receive further teachings from the Koga Scrolls. Seeing his best opportunity to destroy them all he amasses his forces and strikes without mercy. Every single Ninja is slaughtered in this treacherous ambush.[CR]Unknown to Kunitoki, the tradition of the Ninja is to leave one of their own behind to guard the holy shrine of Bunjinkan. Armakuni, now the last Ninja, soon learns of the genocide of his people and swears to destroy Kunitoki. From his childhood, Armakuni remembers the secret passageway that would lead him to the palace of Kunitoki on the impregnable island of Lin Fen. He travels to Lin Fen only to find out that the secret passage to the castle is not as he remembered. His quest for revenge begins...[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Last Ninja contains a combination of exploration, puzzle and combat game mechanics. Since the game has an isometric perspective, there are eight directions the character can move in. However, where Armakuni can move is also defined by pre-existing paths within the game (making some scenery inaccessible). Throughout the game a variety of weapons become available to the player, including a sword, nunchaku, shuriken, staff and smoke bomb(s). By kneeling at certain in-game landmarks, such as Buddha statues or fountains, the player can gain some insight into what they are supposed to do next, a sort of in-game help system. The game also \"scales\" as the player progresses, making the enemies progressively more difficult towards the end.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The island of Lin Fen is split into six distinct districts, each with their own assortment of items and challenges. The six areas (in the order they must be completed in) are:The Wastelands: A bright green grassland surrounded by a rocky landscape, 25 squares total. Here the player must jump from rock to rock in order to collect the essential items from the area. The player must also deal with a large fire-breathing dragon who roams around the Wastelands.The Wilderness: A diverse area with mountain ranges, caves and a bamboo forest that coves a total of 27 screens (the largest area). To complete it, Armakuni must climb his way up a steep cliff by using precise pin-point jumping.The Palace Gardens: a scenic, peaceful area adorned with pictures of flying white doves, grand waterfalls and magnificent flower beds that covers 25 screens. There is a Buddha shrine in this area, along with a lurking blue dragon.The Dungeons: Armakuni gets dropped through a trap door to this haunting area filled with torture chambers that spans 24 screens. Here lie spiders, rats, ghosts and skeletons that all seek to bar the player's progress.The Palace: Decorated with Asiatic furniture, the Palace's 15 screens are filled with highly trained guards that will do everything they can to thwart Armakuni's progress. Also, in the hallway there is a particularly difficult sword-throwing statue that requires the player to remain close to the wall in order to pass safely.The Inner Sanctum: Covering 15 screens, the final area features a secret passage and a notorious archer statue leading up to the final confrontation with an armored Kunitoki. After the player defeats him, he finally relinquishes the scrolls.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]A fun note about one of the two composers of the music for the C64 and Amiga versions of The Last Ninja: Ben Daglish got offered Mark Cale of System 3's slightly-dodgy left-hand-drive BMW as pay for his amazing efforts. Ben aptly responded \"no thanks, I'll have the cash please.\" and that was that. Seemingly a good deal as the car itself wasn't worth much and the actual pay Ben received per tune for the game was about $300.[CR]",

There are five different ones and each has different statistics in terms of top speed, handling and braking. After that the player also gets to choose one of three vehicles (formula one, rally or endurance car). These differ in terms of top speed, braking and acceleration. When all choices have been made it's possible to jump straight into the first race of the championship or to practice on any of the game's race tracks. The game has a total of twelve tracks and these are played through in order. Each race is played against four AI drivers and points are awarded based on positions. To win the championship the player simply has to earn more points than the competitors.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Legend of Kyrandia is a humorous fantasy point and click adventure game developed for home computers by Westwood Studios. It puts the player in the shoes of unlikely hero Brandon, who must uncover his heritage and learn the magic of his family to stop the mad jester Malcolm from destroying the land. Originally released on floppy disks in August 1992, it received an enhanced CD-ROM version with full voice acting in 1993.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]18 years ago the jester Malcolm, a favorite of the Kyrandian court, committed a horrible act of betrayal, killing the king and queen and seizing the Kyragem, the source of all magic of the kingdom. Fearing to confront the power of the gem directly, the royal mystics instead choose to put a barrier around the castle, sealing the mad jester inside.[CR]This successfully contained the jester, but also denied the mystics access to the Kyragem. Without any way to replenish their magic, the mystics' powers began to wane, and eventually the day came when they could no longer maintain the barrier, and Malcolm broke free.[CR]Now free to take his revenge, the wicked joker starts with Kallak, the old leader of the mystics, turning him into a living statue - trapped in stone with only his eyes left untouched.[CR]As Malcolm leaves to wreck havok on the land, Kallak's grandson, Brandon, enters, becoming horrified at what has happened. And if that wasn't enough, he receives a vision from the spirits of land itself revealing that nature itself is dying due to Malcolm's evil magic, and that he has been chosen to stop it - his destiny from before he was born. Startled and confused, Brandon seeks out the help of temple guardian Brynn.[CR]Also a mystic, Brynn tells Brandon the only way to restore his grandfather is to defeat Malcolm. She offers him an enchanted amulet to aid him, and sends him off to see Darm, the mystics' master of scrolls, and Zanthia the alchemist, to help enhance the amulet's power. As he goes about the tasks they give him, he faces increasing obstruction from Malcolm, but grows even more determined when he learns of his heritage. He is the son of the murdered king and queen, a prince of Kyrandia and the country's rightful ruler.[CR]Eventually, Brandon becomes ready to face the mad jester, and uses a potion to travel to the now desolate Kyrandian royal castle. Confident in his advantage, Malcolm gives the young prince free rein to wander the keep and witness the victims of his twisted magic. But Brandon manages to provoke him by going after the Kyragem, and then finally tricks him into turning himself to stone. With Malcolm gone, the land is once again safe, and Brandon is free to take his place on the throne as king of Kyrandia.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Legend of Kyrandia is a classic third person point and click adventure game. It had a very innovative interface, abandoning the list verbs common at the time in favor of the single universal \"use\" cursor seen frequently in modern adventure games. The game also featured a streamlined inventory system, where objects in environment were simply picked up using the cursor and placed in the inventory or used on another object directly, without having to wait for Brandon to be shown walking over to them or performing an action.[CR]Another unusual aspect is the game's handling consumable items. Rather than restricting the character's use of them, or putting the game in an unwinnable state, it instead simply respawns them, either in a specific place, or randomly across the previously visited locations.[CR]Kyrandia did however also suffer from some archaic puzzle design, as some of them are very obtuse. They provided little guidance to the player as to what their immediate goal is or how to reach it, and force the player to resort to simple trial an error to get through them.[CR]Brandon can die if the player performs the wrong action, and places where this can happen are fairly common. Deaths lead to the game being over, and force to player to reload a save game or restart from the beginning. Towards the end, the game can also reach an unwinnable state if Brandon travels to the final location without the required items.[CR]",

The game was known for both its sexual subject matter, which was considered quite controversial, and its humor. The game was created by Al Lowe for Sierra On-Line, and is actually a remake of an earlier Sierra published text-based adventure game called Softporn. Leisure Suit Larry took the anonymous protagonist of Softporn and added graphics and humor while keeping most of the same basic puzzles intact.[CR]Controversy and Age Check[CR]Upon release Sierra had no idea what to do with the racy title. The game was released without any advertisement from the company themselves. Furthermore many retailers refused to advertise the title either. In extreme cases some stores would even omit the game from sales charts. As a result the game severely under performed according to Sierra standards, and it was only a few years later when the game developed a cult following that the series became a success. [CR]When the original EGA version was released, the game came with an \"age check\" to make sure that players were over 18. Rather than ask for a birthday however, the game instead asked several trivia questions that kids in the mid-1980s were unlikely to know the answers to.  Unfortunately for gamers today the trivia check offers the oppisite problem-In general the trivia questions were based on real world events that occured in the 80's and in some cases the multiple choice answers may appear wrong to in hindsight. Fortunately, hitting ctrl-alt-x would bypass the age check, and go directly into the game.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The original Softporn release was the only game Sierra published with no graphics.Designer Al Lowe had gotten sick of generic \"You can't do that\" or \"I don't understand\" messages from parser engines, so he wrote a logging function into test copies of the game. This would keep track of all the commands that players entered that weren't understood by the system, which he could then go over later on and add funny responses to.This game may well be the first to illustrate the benefits of safe sex.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]Fawn (AGI Version)Fawn (SCI Version)[CR]Larry 1 has been released in two different editions. The original AGI version was a parser-based game that required players to use the keyboard to enter commands for Larry to perform (e.g. \"pick up remote control\").[CR]The game was later remade using Sierra's SCI point and click system where icons docked at the top of the screen correspond to various actions. The graphics in the remake were also completely upgraded from the 16-color EGA original.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Larry Laffer: Our hero, Larry is after one thing...and he'll do whatever it takes to get it. The game is not over until you've capped the night off right.[CR]Fawn: Fawn is often found at the disco. She loves dancing, presents, matrimony, and wine.[CR]Eve: Eve spends her time in the hot tub of the penthouse suite at the casino. Her favorite fruit is obvious.[CR]Ken Williams: Ken Williams is a pitchman. You must accomplish all of your goals to see his spiel.[CR]",

Sad news for poor Larry, but great news for us fans! Upon moping away from your former home, Larry manages to win the lottery, AND a spot on a television game show, winning a cruise to an exotic island all in the same day. Then unwittingly becomes the target of the KGB and a mad scientist, who follow him to his tropical destination of Nontoonyt Island! As you'd expect, plenty of hilarity ensues in this worthy sequel to The Land of the Lounge Lizards.Because of the controversial themes of the first Larry game, Sierra wanted to tone down the sequel. Resultantly, were left with a hilariously funny game without much sexual humour. In fact even attempting to have sex in the game, usually results in Larry's demise. Sierra later ditched this idea for later sequels of the game, after criticisms from fans of the series that Larry 2 was not raunchy/sexy enough. For this reason, the game did not feature an age check, or a trivia of worldly knowledge that would otherwise be before a youngsters time to be able to answer, but rather a basic copy protection.[CR]",

Now Larry is left free to explore the resort, arrange his divorce, and meet girls. His encounters with women always tend to fail, with Larry ending up humiliated in some way. This continues until he finds a membership card to Fat City where he will improve his body. Then, he will meet his \"One Tru Love\", who this time is a pianist named Passionate Patti.Patti in the jungleIn the second part of the game, Larry gets the idea that Patti isn't into him. Rejected for the last time, he vows celibacy and runs off into the jungle. Of course, Patti does love Larry and wants to get him back. So, the player takes control of Patti in her quest to find Larry. At the end of the game, Larry and Patti are teleported to Sierra's Coarsegold, California studios, where, after navigating through set pieces from various other Sierra game series, they meet Roberta Williams.

The end result is a point-and-click adventure that features alternating takes between Larry Laffer, the series' protagonists, and his love interest from Leisure Suit Larry 3, Passionate Patty. The game crossed into new territory for the series. It was the first icon-based game in the series, and featured gameplay that wouldn't allow Larry or Patty to die or render the game unbeatable.[CR]The narrative also shifts from previous games. The game's story became almost episodic, with a few overarching ties in the plot. This time around, Larry works as a field reporter for a sleazy porn video company, seeking out new models for his boss. Alternately, Patti has become an undercover FBI agent, investigating record companies for claims of subliminal messaging. The two have little interaction until the later parts of the game. Gamers would spend some time with one character, completing their particular goal (or in Larry's case, scoring), completing that particular part of the game, and then switch to the other character.[CR]",

The island is divided into twelve regions, one for each tribe. Some tribes differ in color, but all are controlled in the same way. Some abilities are specific to certain tribes, while others are reused several times.[CR]The land of each tribe has its own visual style and music, and some unique challenges.[CR]Psygnosis published the game in the US and Europe. SunSoft would produce the Japanese console versions, as they had with Lemmings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Land of the Lemmings[CR]The game features 120 levels split equally between the 12 tribes. When the 10 levels of any tribe are complete, a segment of a talisman is awarded. When all 12 pieces of talisman are united, the island of the lemmings will be saved.[CR]Over 50 types of lemming are featured in Tribes, compared to just 8 of the original game.[CR]Each Tribe starts with 60 lemmings. In a significant departure from other Lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived could proceed to the next level, which might lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring earlier levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze are awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] additions not related to the lemmings themselves include hazards and challenges specific to each environment, and the interface features an additional 'fan' icon, which allows drifting lemmings to be blown along.[CR]Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Tribes of Lemmings 2:Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)SpaceThe Lemmings of the Twelve TribesArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker[CR]*returning from the original Lemmings.

A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]",

Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull.

With aid from your four droids you are able to search the city for victims, those used in the cover-ups, of BioCorp. With each minor victory your intent becomes clearer - to persuade the Emperor in regaining control over the corporate hegemony.Liberation is set in a large futuristic city and is a free-range, open-ended RPG. As in its predecessor, you can buy better weapons, from swords to laser-rifles and enhance your droids with new equipment, e.g. numerous head-slots which plug in and give droids different abilities, ultimately driving you closer to the Emperor.",

This originally black and white game allowed the player to interact with the environments in a point and click interface. In this precursor to Trauma Center, typical surgery instruments were available for the player to use in any order, as a close up of the patient's body is seen laying on the table. It is still one of only a few realistic medical games ever developed, allowing the player to diagnose treat a variety of conditions including kidney stones, arthritis and appendicitis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must prep the patient by scrubbing down, applying anesthesia, and cauterizing incisions. Before surgery, however, the player must make a visit to the patient's room, where he or she is allowed to study the patient's medial chart for any clues to diagnoses.You can start poking parts of the patients abdomen and see what they say (just don't poke to much). There are also a number of tools to help, like the x-ray.[CR]The game had an interesting bit of physical DRM. Most games of the time came with a dictionary or an instruction manual, and to play a new game you would have to type in a specific word on a specific page of that book. This led to much wasted copy paper. The physical DRM of Life and Death was a paper \"beeper\" that had multiple wheels to align. You would have to align the wheels according to a number that the receptionist gave you before you could start a case.[CR]The player can choose two members of the medial staff to accompany the surgery, offering expertise from their field. For example, the cardiologist will offer advice on the patient's blood flow, while the nurse walks the player through simple procedures, such as suturing and clamping.[CR]Once you have found out what's wrong with the patients (after a few deaths), you get to the best part of the game: OPERATING! This is by far the hardest part of the game. You'll have to follow all kinds of medical procedures. Incisions are made using the mouse. This is the only part of the game that is animated.[CR]Clicking on the various doors in the hospital will take the doctor to their labeled rooms. The School room debriefs players on previously failed cases, with the instructor offering specific criticism of the player's actions. He may comment that the player was \"padding the bill\" with unnecessary gauze or stitches, or that the player's \"impersonation of Jack the Ripper\" was unacceptable behavior. The School room also provides the player with a brief overview of diagnosing cases, and simple surgical steps. Once in the OR, the player can exit the surgery by calling the Chief Surgeon to step in and take over the job. At the time of release this game was unique in it's kind.[CR]",

The interface in Loom is unlike any of the other  SCUMM games; Bobbin interacts with his surroundings by using musical enchantments, which replace the standard adventure game commands. The game turned out to not as successful as Lucasfilms had hoped, and therefore the planned sequel never was created.[CR]Loom is referenced in a few other  LucasArts games, most notably  The Secret of Monkey Island. Examples include a minor Loom character appearing as the pirate in the  SCUMM bar who shamelessly advertises Loom, as well as  Guybrush's reaction to  Meathook. A dialogue selection from that event reads \"I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?\" Meathook replies, \"Your mother was a duck.\" in reference to the swan from Loom. A seagull from Loom can also be found by the water outside the SCUMM Bar kitchen.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The original release of Loom came with an audio cassette containing a 30 minute dramatized prologue for the game.[CR]All the music in Loom is from the 1877 ballet \"Swan Lake\" by Tchaikovsky.[CR]Rerelease[CR]Loom was re-released on Steam on July 8th, 2009 along with a few other LucasArts classic adventure games.[CR]",

It's now your responsibility to lead the remaining survivors to the nearest U.S. base, evading or facing an elusive and dangerous enemy on his own grounds.[CR]Most of the time, you'll see a map of the country on the screen and navigate your men through the country. It's important to watch your men's health and morale by getting them food, water, ammo and letting them rest, etc. When reaching certain spots on the map, e.g. a native village, the game presents the current situation in a nice graphic scene. Sometimes you'll run into V.C. snipers, patrols, whole ambushes or encounter minefields. Then the game offers some small arcade sequences like firing your guns or fighting it out in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The progress of your party is accompanied by video sequences from the Vietnam War.",

The goal is to guide all Vikings safely through each level. The game's originality is due to the fact that the player controls three different characters (although only one at any given time), and must make use of their individual abilities and their combination to solve puzzles and progress. The game featured infinite opportunities of retries in case the player were to lose one of the Vikings. Much of the game's appeal came from the humorous inter-level dialogues of the characters.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The three vikings[CR]This game sets players with the task of completing each level by using 3 different characters. This requires the use of each Viking's abilities as well as getting them all to the area's exit point alive.[CR]Erik the Swift - As his name states, he is very agile being the only one of the three that can run or jump. That fact alone makes him invaluable in a platformer but, additionally, if he gets a large enough start he can do a speeding charge helmet first into things. It will damage enemies but it's main use is in destroying breakable walls.[CR]Baleog the Fierce - He lives up to the name by being the main fighter. He has a sword to strike down enemies and a longbow to kill from afar. His bow serves the dual purpose of being able to activate buttons from a distance. In certain stages, Baelog is able to set his arrows on fire to solve various puzzles.[CR]Olaf the Stout - He carries on him a large round shield as tall as himself which lets him stop almost any attack. This can halt approaching enemies, or protect the vikings from any oncoming projectiles. His shield can also be lifted above his head. Not only will this work as a platform allowing Erik a higher jump from, but it manages to serve as a hang glider for Olaf, allowing his stout frame to float through the air.[CR]Areas[CR]The game consists of 36 stages, divided into several chapters, each with a different theme.Stages 1-4: The vikings attempt to escape from the alien shipStages 5-11: The vikings are in prehistoric Earth, fighting dinosaurs and cave-menStages 12-17: The vikings are in ancient Egypt, and now have to contend enemies which are able to leap over Olaf's shield, as well as poisonous insects.Stages 18-25: The vikings are in a modern factory, and must navigate more automated environmental hazards.Stages 26-33: The vikings are in \"Wonderland\", and area that operates off of cartoon physics.Stages 34-36: The vikings are back on the alien ship and must now fight Tomator, the leader of the aliens.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 6,8,8,8, adding, \"Another excellent job from Interplay! Once you play, you're greeted with excellent soundtracks and plenty of bass! The puzzles get very difficult but are not frustrating. The Viking characters have their own personalities complete with comical antics. This game is a definite must-get\".[CR]Starcraft II Tribute[CR]The Hyperion's bar in Starcraft II has an arcade machine named \"The Lost Viking\". It's a shoot'em up where players take control of a lost spaceship (named 'Viking' after the SC2 Terran unit) trying to get home.[CR]",

Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). [CR]The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.",

However, this powerful magical sword has of course been missing for an what seems to be an eternity and in order to recover it, the player must go out into the world and find all the pieces of a lost treasure map showing its location. However, if the player fails to succeed in finding the Blade in two (in-game) years, the Orcs will attack the Humans and its game over.[CR]But should the player succeed in finally finding the sword, they then needs to defeat the Orc chieftain and his minions in a final battle for survival.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny has the player going through towns and dungeons in a 3D first-person perspective.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released by its publisher Sierra Entertainment on December 19, 1990, Red Baron, which is not to be confused with the 1980 vector-graphics Atari arcade game of the same name, is a combat flight simulator created by Damon Slye and Dynamix, Inc. Set against the backdrop of World War I, Red Baron allows players to pilot a number of early fighter planes, including the German Fokker Eindecker, the British Sopwith Triplane, and the French Nieuport 17, engaging other pilots in combat either as part of the German Air Service or the Royal Flying Corps. Players can fly a variety of missions on an individual basis or alternatively partake in a career mode in which performance is tracked across missions, allowing pilots to gain higher ranks, better stations, and access to more advanced fighter planes.The Red Baron Title Card[CR]In addition to simulating the handling and performance of several well-known WWI fighter craft, Red Baron also includes a number of \"famous aces\" within its flight roster, which are essentially A.I. pilots meant to emulate some of the most successful pilots of the First World War. Just like the planes themselves, these aces were researched in order to properly depict their strengths, weaknesses, and idiosyncrasies. Manfred von Richthofen, for instance, the titular Red Baron, will never perform a loop, as this was in reality a maneuver that Richthofen firmly believed to be useless in a combat situation.[CR]Though released initially as a PC title, Red Baron was later ported to the Mac and the Amiga in 1992, and that same year the PC version received an expansion disk called Red Baron: Mission Builder. The Mission Builder expansion disk augmented the original game by allowing players to create and play custom scenarios; it simultaneously added new gameplay options, six new aces, and five new airplanes. Sierra would later release Red Baron again for the PC as a free download on February 10, 1997, the same year that the Red Baron sequel/remake Red Baron II was released. On October 9, 2009, shortly after Mad Otter Games, a development studio founded by Red Baron series creator Damon Slye, acquired the rights to the franchise, the game was rereleased via GOG as part of the Red Baron Pack, which includes the original game and the Mission Builder expansion as well as Red Baron 3D, an upgraded version of Red Baron II that was first released in 1998.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Red Baron, players are tasked with successfully piloting various WWI-era fighter planes on a variety of missions along the Western Front of the First World War, with the main activity in most missions being dogfights between two or more aircraft. From the main menu, players can choose one of three play options: one-on-one dogfights against a famous WWI fighter pilot of the player's choice, one-off missions with a large number of adjustable variables, or a career mode which charts players' progress and advancement throughout the war. Provided the appropriate realism settings are enabled, Red Baron players are required to contend with many of the same challenges that actual World War I pilots would have faced, such as machine guns that are prone to jam or the very real threat of serious bodily injury due to the lightly-armored nature of airplanes produced in this period.Only the most fearsome pilots can tackle the Red Baron and live to tell about it.[CR]Red Baron includes a number of convenience features and special options to make the game more palatable for players who may not be looking for exacting realism. For one, many difficulty and authenticity features can be adjusted or disabled via the game's \"Realism Panel\"; the settings chosen in this panel govern everything from the overall difficulty of the flight model and air combat to whether or not the player's aircraft can collide with other objects or even take damage at all. During missions, it is also possible to activate a time compression mechanic (by pressing the C button) that accelerates time significantly, allowing large distances to be covered more rapidly. Finally, players can choose before any mission to make a recording for view at a later time, and when watching this recording it is possible to jump into the simulation at any point in order to play out the rest of the mission.Career Mode[CR]While Red Baron has a wide variety of single-mission options, the career mode is the game's main method of play. At the outset, players create a pilot and choose an alignment: either the German Air Service or the Royal Flying Corps. From here, players begin to take on missions in order to further the war effort and increase their own stature and military rank. Successfully completing missions and shooting down enemy aircraft may result in commendations such as the Allied Victoria Cross or the German Order of Merit, while outstanding performance will result in a promotion. A single promotion allows players to lead their own squadron into combat, while a second promotion will result in the acquisition of a personal aircraft that can be customized with a unique paint job and exchanged for a better plane when available.[CR]The career mode commences in December of 1915 and continues, provided the player survives, until the war's end on November 10, 1918. Over the course of the campaign, it is possible to be transferred to other aerodromes to fly with more prestigious squadrons or even alongside famous flying aces. As a side effect of success, if the player's reputation grows sufficiently, they may be challenged by rival aces to single combat, though it is not necessary to accept these challenges. Players can be taken out of commission for a time by injury or capture, and poor mission performance may result in reprimand or even permanent grounding. Once the player's career ends, their final stats are displayed, allowing them to easily compare their performance over the course of the war to that of history's most decorated aces.Single MissionsCertain missions call for attacks against zeppelins or observation balloons.[CR]Flying single missions in Red Baron allows players to engage in highly customizable scenarios, which were made all the more customizable by the release of the Mission Builder in 1992. Among other things, players can designate weather conditions, starting location, distance to target, and their starting altitude in relation to their enemy. This also includes choosing what aircraft will be used both by the player and their opposition, in addition to any realism and difficulty settings desired. When a single flight mission is completed, a breakdown screen is displayed, rating the player's performance based on a number of factors.Mission TypesFly a Historic Mission: Offers missions based on some of the most famous aerial battles of WWI.Dogfight a Famous Ace: Players select a famous fighter pilot and face off in a one-on-one battle.Dogfight a Squadron: Two squadrons of fighters are pitted against each other in aerial combat.Patrol the Front: Pilots must patrol the Front and dispatch any opposition they encounter.Escort a Bombing Raid: An allied bomber requires protection as it proceeds on its mission.Stop a Bombing Raid: An enemy bomber is en route and must be intercepted before it strikes.Hunt a Zeppelin: A dangerous German zeppelin must be shot down before it can spread chaos.Escort Reconnaissance: Recon planes must be protected against attack as they gather intel.Balloon Defense: Observation balloons are under attack and must be defended against the enemy.Balloon Busting!: Enemy observation balloons must be destroyed to cripple enemy intelligence.Build a Custom Mission: Enter the Mission Builder to create a scenario (Requires Mission Builder).Fly a Custom Mission: Fly a mission created through the Mission Builder (Requires Mission Builder).Adjustable RealismThe Realism Panel[CR]Unlike many flight simulators, in which the realism of the simulation is considered paramount, Red Baron's flight model is intended to strike a balance between historical accuracy and playability. To this end, many of the game's more realistic concerns, such as gun jamming and high-altitude carburetor freezes, can be disabled, and these adjustments can be made at any time, even during a mission. There are Novice, Intermediate, and Expert presets for realism, however fine-tuning of the game's setting is allowed as well if the player has specific tastes.Realism SettingsRealistic Instruments: Disables any instruments in the panel that would not be available during WWI.Sun Blind Spot: Allows the Sun to obscure visibility of aircraft until said aircraft are extremely close.Realistic Weather: When enabled, weather conditions may vary and have an impact on missions.Gun Jams Allowed: Determines whether or not guns will jam, forcing the player to unjam them.Blackouts Allowed: Dictates whether or not a pilot will black out from lack of oxygen at high altitudes.Midair Collisions: When disabled, aircraft can pass through other planes (Requires Mission Builder).Carburetor Freezes: When enabled, a carburetor may freeze at high elevation due to the cold.Limited Ammunition: Decides whether or not the player has a limited supply of machine gun ammo.Limited Fuel: When checked, airplanes will consume fuel over time and eventually run out of it.Real Navigation: Enables or disables navigation assistance, which WWI pilots would not have had.Aircraft May Be Damaged: When not checked, the player's aircraft will not take any damage at all.Combat Level: Specifies the overall combat proficiency of enemy pilots (Requires Mission Builder).Flight Model: Governs the general level of authenticity the game's flight model attempts to emulate.[CR]Planes[CR]Red Baron features a number of WWI aircraft of varying capabilities. During single missions, players can choose any plane native to their chosen side, however when playing the career mode there is the added wrinkle of the plane's creation date, as it is not possible to utilize an aircraft before it has been conceived of and manufactured. On more exacting realism settings, the specific properties of a plane may have a noticeable impact on performance. Planes with rotary engines, for instance, may have more difficulty with turns than others due to the gyroscopic effect produced by their engines' motion, while others may be more susceptible to wing shearing during intense flight maneuvers.German PlanesStatisticsAllied PlanesStatisticsFokker Eindecker[CR]Fokker EindeckerArmament: 1x SpandauMaximum Speed: 88 mphDate Introduced: August 1915Nieuport 11*[CR]Nieuport 11*Armament: 1x Hotchkiss or LewisMaximum Speed: 97 mphDate Introduced: January 1916Halberstadt D.

The A.I. for each ace is specifically modeled to closely resemble the historical fighter pilot they represent by incorporating known propensities of their real-world counterparts into their battlefield behaviors. In career mode, a pilot must exhibit significant skill in order to earn the right to fly in an ace's squadron, and likewise players must make a name for themselves before an enemy ace will consider challenging them to an aerial duel.German AcesStatisticsAllied AcesStatisticsManfred von Richthofen[CR]Manfred von RichthofenAerial Victories: 80Planes: Albatros D.

GameSpot's Denny Atkin, speaking of the game in 1998, called it a \"true classic,\" going on to explain that the game \"set new standards for graphics, flight modeling, and overall realism.\" Computer Gaming World named it their 1991 Simulation Game of the Year, and five years later CGW also gave it the #4 slot in their feature of the best PC games ever created. It has also appeared no less than three times on PC Gamer's recurring \"Best Games Ever!\" feature, being awarded the #12 spot in 1997, #20 in 1998, and #24 in 1999.[CR]",

Two research ships, designated Explorer-1 and Explorer-2, are outfitted with experimental drive and sent to find new planets of colonization. Only Explorer-2 returns back to Earth. Refiited as a colony vessel, Explorer-2 is once again ready to embark when peace is disrupted. At this same time, a planet-wide rebellion stages a coup and overthrows the government. The Explorer-2, crewed by a loyalist space crew barely escapes and leaves the solar system. Years later, the Explorer-2 arrives damaged at it's destination and a colony is set up, naming it New Earth. After many generations, the colony is self-sufficient enough to develop a mission: Explore nearby space, research new technologies, harvest resources, develop a space fleet and eventually... reconquer and reunify with the Earth.[CR]Reunion is a strategy game where players must manage the resources and development of a colony. From a central command area, players select from among different menus to control different aspects of the colony. Many of these menus also need the appropriate personnel in charge (commanders), whose skills and price tag vary. Typical menus include: The research screen where specific areas are selected, the production/buy menu which turns resources into goods, the colony building menu where construction can be scheduled and the colony's facilities managed, the galactic map where new planets are chosen for a closer look, and eventually colonization. Players can also consult with their commanders or go to \"space local\", the nearby bar for all the gossip. In order to produce new material, the player has six different minerals to mine and discover on various planets in the solar system.",

In Rise of the Dragon players take on the role of an ex-cop private detective who gets swept up in a sinister plot created by a Fu Manchu-like adversary.  While much of the style of the game borrows heavily from Blade Runner (the main character and protagonist's name is Blade, perhaps as an homage to the film) and its hard boiled spiritual predecessors (with crowded, dingy L.A. streets, seedy bars, strong Eastern influences, trench coats, and cynical attitudes), there are high adventure pulp elements as well, with broadly drawn caricatures as enemies and allies, as well as the \"chosen one\" trope used since prehistory and a pseudo-historical Eastern cult which vaguely resembles the   Cthulhu mythos in its modern-yet-supernatural scope.Players have access to various map locations accessible by subway trains, more of which open up as clues are uncovered and puzzles are solved.  The puzzles themselves use inventory and exploration, as well as experimentation with devices found in the environment.  There are also dialogue choices during conversations, and a few action sequences during key moments.The art style emulates certain comic book styles, with slightly exaggerated, emotive faces.  There are some photorealistic touches, such as the bitmapped photographic frames used during telephone message sequences (which is jarring when you consider that the same people who leave messages for you have comic book-style equivalent faces when you meet them in person).Some of the puzzles and events are also time-based.  Players must pay attention to a clock and calendar in the upper-right portion of the screen.  You will, for example, have a date scheduled for a day and time, and your date expects you to arrive promptly.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]At the time of the game's release, people were very impressed by the advanced 3D visuals.Rise of the Robots is a fighting game developed by Mirage Technologies and released on a wide variety of platforms including the SNES and Sega Master System. The game was even released in an arcade cabinet.All of the featured characters are robots, with the exception of the main player character featured on the front cover, who is in fact a cyborg; whenever he is defeated in battle, a brief cutscene is shown of his lifeless body, and as the armour around his face is destroyed, we see a human eye underneath. This style was influenced by several popular movies at the time like Blade Runner and The Terminator.The game had a lot of hype pre-release due to the highly detailed visuals and soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). It was intended to take the gameplay of similar fighting games like Street Fighter II, and mesh it with highly advanced visuals to create a new, more technologically advanced era of fighting games. However, upon release the game failed to live up to expectations; the graphics, visuals, and soundtrack were all well made, but the controls handled terribly and movement felt sluggish. The game was almost universally panned by critics and quickly became known for it's poor controls, repetitive gameplay, and lack of any real substance. Some critics went so far as to claim that the reason the gameplay was so bad, was because so much development time had been spent on making the visuals as advanced as possible, and that the reason the movement and fighting felt so sluggish was because the graphics had to use so much memory and so many frames to even convey something as simple as a straight punch. Aside from the usual commands of punches and kicks, there were only a maximum of two special moves per character, and no real combos to speak of, leading to most battles involving players resorting to using constant flying kicks against their opponent in order to take them down, a strategy seen in much older games like Yie Ar Kung Fu. In addition one of the chief complaints was that players only had one character to chose from in single player mode (Cotton) and that even in multiplayer mode one player always had to play as Cotton.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the year 2043, in the land of Metropolis 4. An extremely large company called Electrocorp has a large amount of control over the world thanks to their technological breakthroughs in the fields of science and medicine, they have amassed a fortune greater than that of any other company or country, and have power over all the energy distribution across the planet. In this world, robots are humans servants and perform virtually every task imaginable, leaving humans to focus on developing more important technology and try to make new scientific breakthroughs. Electrocorp, as the world's leading producer and distributor of robots, has been put under great pressure due to the high demand of the increasing global population and so decide to create a supremely advanced AI which will be able to manage the company effectively and cope with the demand of the people. Thus, the Leader Project is established at the Metropolis 4 sector of the Electrocorp company. The project culminates with the creation of The Supervisor, an incredibly intelligent robot, more advanced than anything Electrocorp has ever built before, with the capacity to learn at an incredibly fast rate, along with being able to absorb knowledge from computer terminals in a matter of seconds, The Supervisor quickly exceeds all expectations of the scientists at Metropolis 4, and seems to have become the perfect robot, easily able to cope with the high levels of demand faced by the company, along with developing new ways to increase productivity and efficiency within Electrocorp. The Supervisor is granted power to control every single robot on the planet whenever it needs to.However, things do not continue to go according to plan, while running general diagnostic checks on The Supervisor at Metropolis 4, the scientists discover some new mysterious lines of data in their results and quickly learn that The Supervisor has been infected with the most advanced computer virus ever seen, the EGO virus. Normally this virus would simply destroy a computer or robot, but the effects seen on The Supervisor are completely unexpected. The Supervisor becomes self-aware, it begins to question why it has been made and why it should continue to do as it has been programmed, The Supervisor then takes on a humanoid female form as it decides to create a gender-specific identity for itself. As the virus continues to disrupt the programming put in place by Electrocorp, The Supervisor decides to disobey all orders from the company and take control of every robot on the planet, transmitting the virus to them electronically and ordering them all to rebel against their human masters, initiating a global cybernetic mutiny. The robots begin to destroy everything around them and chaos spreads across the globe, meanwhile, some scientists and officials trapped inside the plant at Metropolis 4 try to come up with a plan to destroy The Supervisor, there is no way for any of them to access her as she is guarded by an army of destructive robots, and so they decide to contact the cyborg ECO35-2, known affectionately as Coton, a half-robot, half-human creation who has not been affected by the EGO virus thanks to his organic brain, the scientists inform Coton that he is the world's only hope for survival and he must battle his way through Metropolis 4 to The Supervisor and eliminate her. Thus the battle begins, with Coton having to take on all of The Supervisor's powerful robot minions, before eventually reaching her and defeating her humanoid form in combat, thus restoring order to the planet and saving all of it's surviving inhabitants.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ECO35-2 (Coton) - The protagonist of the story and only playable character in the single-player campaign, Coton is a cyborg with a human mind and organs, developed in secret by Electrocorp with a budget equivalent to that of the Leader Project. Despite his enemies often carrying and utilising weapons of some kind, Coton fights using only his fists, he has a thick armour plating covering his humanoid body from head to toe, and has been genetically engineered to be as fast and simultaneously powerful as possible. As stated, he has a human central nervous system and brain, no electrical components have been inserted into his body and so the EGO virus had no effect on him, allowing him to retain autonomy and take orders from the Electrocorp scientists to go after The Supervisor. All of his human organs were cloned from the CEO of Electrocorp, who in turn raised Coton as his own son, thus, when the CEO was slaughtered by rebellious robots in the beginning's of the robot mutiny of Metropolis 4, Coton wanted revenge for the murder of what he believed to be his father, thus giving him extra incentive and motive to pursue The Supervisor and destroy her.His special attacks are as follows:Turbo Head Butt - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Charge - A short range barge attack, useful for getting out of corners.Loader - This is the first of six enemies Coton encounters in his quest to destroy The Supervisor. The loader, as its name suggests, was originally simply a loading droid working in the warehouses of Metropolis 4, its primary duty being to lift and carry heavy objects and load them onto trucks to be dispatched elsewhere. When it became infected with the EGO virus however, this loader became a destructive and lethal force, despite being slow-moving and ill-suited for combat, the loader has powerful attacks thanks to its heavy forked arms. As this is the first enemy in the game, it is slow moving and has poor AI, and can easily be defeated with Coton's superior speed and jumping abilities.The special attack of the Loader:Fork Slash - A mighty horizontal blow in which the Loader swings its fork arms at its opponent, slicing anything that gets in the way.Builder - The second enemy encountered in the game, the builder has the appearance of a large blue robotic gorilla, and acts in a similar fashion, using its superior upper body strength to move along on its knuckles whilst defending its relatively small and weak legs. This enemy is also slow-moving and focuses mainly on defense, forcing Coton to gradually wear it down with a rapid succession of attacks.The special attacks of the Builder:Pile Driver - This is a grab move wherein the Builder picks up Coton, spinning him upside down before slamming him down into the ground.Bomber Jump - With this move, the Builder demonstrates its surprising acrobatic abilities by leaping high into the air and slamming down to the ground, releasing a destructive shockwave upon impact.Crusher - The first relatively fast enemy encountered in the game, the Crusher has an insect like appearance, light thin legs allow for much more rapid movement than either the Loader or the Builder, and its sharp snapping pincers have the potential to do a great deal of damage should anything be caught within their grasp.The special attack of the Crusher:Pincer-Mincer - In this attack the Crusher extends its long arms, if it manages to connect with its opponent, the pincers will slowly crush the life out of them.Military - The first enemy encountered by Coton that has true fighting experience and was genuinely designed for combat, the Military droid appears humanoid in shape, can move almost as fast as Coton, and has powerful punches and kicks. This enemy has a high level of defense and is programmed to be able to quickly adapt to any combat situation, meaning that the AI for this enemy is more advanced than those that preceded it.Special attacks of the Military droid:Catapult Spin - For this attack the Military droid extends its arms and spins towards its opponent, should Coton come into contact with the spinning arms he will incur a great amount of damage.Cyber Slash - Here the Military droid reveals a hidden weapon, an extendable sword protrudes from its arm which it then uses to slash at anything in its path.Sentry - Another droid built for combat. The Sentry is a red, demonic looking robot, much stronger than the Military droid, and standing at 3.5 metres tall, the Sentry poses an intimidating challenge for Coton. The jets on its back allow it to fly for brief periods of time, and there are several in-built weapons upon the Sentry, none of which are actually utilised in game.Special attack of the Sentry:Flying Jet Kick - Here the Sentry makes use of its jetpacks to fly towards its opponent at rapid speed, delivering a destructive kick.The Supervisor - The final enemy in the game and by far the most advanced. The Supervisor appears in a humanoid female form, possessing both incredible speed and power to rival that of Coton, along with the most advanced artificial intelligence known to man, The Supervisor is certainly Coton's most difficult opponent.[CR]Sequel[CR]A sequel to the game, entitled Resurrection: Rise 2, was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC in 1996. It featured several of the characters from the first game, continuing the story of Coton, and once again included music written and performed by Brian May.[CR]",

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.[CR]By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.[CR]Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.",

                "plot": "[CR]Introduction[CR]Released alongside Robocop 3 as a PC conterpart to the 2D console ones, Robocop 3D included four 3D game modes in one, including driving, flying, beat-em-up, and FPS. You can either pick any mode in \"Arcade Action\", or choose the \"Movie Adventure\" that arrange the modes into full single player story while including cut scenes in between levels. The story opens up like with a newscast covering the recent crimewave of a new gang of criminals known as the Splatterpunks. They go on to announce the Splatterpunks have taken hostages which leads to Robocop chasing them and is the opening to the first game mode.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]Driving Mode:[CR]In driving mode Robocop must chase down the Splatterpunks and ram into them in order to take their health down. The Splatterpunks don't take this lieing down, as they fire back out of the back of their vans, meaning Robocop has to slam into the side of their cars if he wants to keep his health intact. This all takes place over an open world map where robocop can drive anywhere he wants and the mini-map is needed in order to track down the vans full of hostages. The driving mode also includes a cinematic camera mode.Shooting Mode:[CR]The shooting mode is the most popular mode. In shooting mode Robocop must walk through a building, shooting all the men with guns while avoiding shooting the hostages. Because of the lack of textures thanks to the vector graphics, all of the NPCs look exactly the same, so the only way to determine if a man is hostage is by their animations. The shooting retical flows freely on the screen, allowing Robocop to shoot multiple targets without having to physically turn. The standard controls for this mode only requires the mouse, with the right mouse button being the walk button and left click being the fire button. In order to turn you have to point your retical to the sides of the screen. To help you find your way to the objective there is a beeping noise, which gets more frequent the closer to the objective you are.Flying Mode:[CR]In flying mode Robocop puts on his jetpack and flys around the same city as in the driving mode. This is by far the most difficult mode, as it is extremely hard to avoid being it by enemies or run into the sides of buildings. The giant radar helps by giving a 2D representation of where they are in the world.Fighting Mode:[CR]Robocop can also fight punks and ninja robots in hand to hand combat. Just like the rest of the modes, the fights are fully in 3D where Robocop can walk freely around the room as he punches the evildoers. The controls are just like in the original Resident Evil where pressing left and right makes Robocop move left and right relative to his view and not the camera.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Robocop 3D was largely overshadowed by Robocop 3 on consoles like the NES, but was largely acclaimed as the better game. Robocop 3D incorporated numerous concepts that were pretty new at the time but have been replicated in newer games including a very open 3D city and a realistic HUD that animated based on in game actions like getting hit. Robocop was attempted again as a 3D FPS in 2003 in a game simply called Robocop, but Robocop (2003) was a critical and sales failure ending the line of Robocop video games.[CR]",

According to the box, it \"combines the tactical challenge of chess with the intensity of guerilla warfare to provide total strategic mayhem.\"  It is notable as one of the first network games (the Mac version supporting Appletalk, the PC version supporting NetBIOS, and the Amiga version supporting TCP/IP), and one of the first games to include replays of completed games.Each team of robots in a game of RoboSport is controlled by either a human or AI player, and begins in a \"home area\".  Each robot on a team can be programmed with point-and-click commands for up to 15 seconds.  Programmable moves can include moving around the map, raising/lowering the head of the robot (changing your field of view), firing a weapon at a particular location, or scanning for enemy players and firing if they are seen. After all moves have been entered for each teams, the game generates the outcome of all moves, and players are treated to \"movie mode\", where they can review how their moves played out.  Robots that receive too much damage are removed from the playfield.  The players then begin another round until one player is declared the victor or time runs out. The game features 24 maps - eight sizes across three tilesets (suburbs, rubble, and computer).  Because nearly every aspect of the game can be customized (mode, map, team size, team roster), the game is considered to be highly customizable. The game included a separate application called \"RoboPlayer\", which allowed players to review completed games.[CR]Game Modes (\"Sports\")[CR] Survival (last team standing wins)Capture the Flag (grab the other team's flag and return it to your home area)HostageTreasure HuntBaseball    (touch all four bases to win)[CR]",

The game offers two different control methods for the shot: two-click (choosing the loft from a menu and then clicking twice with the correct timing to select the power and drift) and the stroke method (after selecting the power, a miniature ball appears and the player has to click on it. The position of the click sets where the club hits the ball and therefore the drift). The latter is also available in a variant in which the ball randomly moves to make it harder.The tournament itself is a match between a European and US team with twelve athletes each.

Upon arrival he meets three \" important looking pirates\" in the SCUMM Bar who set him three challenges to test his worthiness. These entail defeating the legendary insult sword fighting master Carla, finding buried treasure and stealing a statue from the governors mansion. During a botched break-in to the mansion he meets and subsequently falls in love with the governor Elaine Marley. Elsewhere the ghost pirate LeChuck is seen pining after the love of his life, the same Elaine Marley, and hatches a plan to capture her. While Guybrush is busy finishing the trials LeChuck and his ghost pirate crew abduct her and take her to Monkey Island. Upon completing the trials Guybrush discovers this revelation, purchases a ship from Stan, a used ship salesman who informs him the ship requires a crew of four people. After gathering Carla, the sword fighting Master he had previously defeated, Meathook, a pirate with two hooks replacing his hands, and Otis a prisoner in Melee Island's Prison Guybrush and crew set sail in pursuit to rescue her.[CR]Upon setting sail Guybrush's crew mutinied against him, and decided to sunbathe instead. After following the instructions on his map to get to Monkey Island, he shoots himself onto the island.;[CR]Arriving at Monkey Island he discovers a strange band of cannibals and a hermit named Herman Toothrot. After helping the cannibals recover a lost voodoo ingredient they provide him with a recipe to destroy ghosts. When attempting to confront LeChuck however he finds only a single crewman who informs him of LeChuck's intention to marry Elaine on Melee Island. He sets sail once more.[CR]Returning to Melee Island he arrives at the church with intent to prevent the marriage but finds Elaine had her own plan of escape. LeChuck attacks Guybrush and after lengthy exchange the two arrive at the ship emporium whereupon Guybrush sprays LeChuck with root beer, the cannibals ghost fighting elixir being made from voodoo root. With LeChuck demise Guybrush and Elaine share a romantic moment, watching fireworks.[CR]Development[CR]Developed by Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, The Secret of Monkey Island began production shortly after Gilbert finished work on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The pirate premise of the game was inspired by Gilbert's love of The Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland. His desire was to create a lush and fanciful world fill with swashbuckling pirates much like those seen in classic film and literature.[CR]The team's desire was to create a more accessible adventure game that anyone at any skill level could enjoy. Until then the genre had been known for being filled with difficult and often esoteric puzzles and full of trial and error gameplay. Gilbert and company hoped to avoid this by offering non linear puzzle sections such as The Three Trials where the player is free to work on a second puzzle if another becomes too difficult. The series also set the precedent in Lucasarts adventures of never allowing the player to die.[CR]Just before the game was set to ship, the company responsible for boxing the games and shipping to retailers told Lucasarts that they could not fill the order in time due to need to give their workers time off. This prompted nearly all of the Lucasarts staff to, themselves, box and ship all of the initial copies of The Secret of Monkey Island. Gilbert has said that during this time he, Grossman and Schafer each signed a one dollar bill and slipped it into one of the boxes. It's unknown if anyone ever found it.[CR]Insult Sword Fighting[CR]When sword fighting, it's not enough to have the right technique, you must also be able to parry an opponent's insults with appropriately witty responses. For example; the correct response to \"You fight like a dairy farmer!\" would be \"How appropriate, you fight like a cow!\". If the fighter responds with the correct come back, he earns the right to dish out the next insult. The first to three insults wins the fight.[CR]In-Jokes[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island is filled with references to Loom, another Lucasarts game released around the same time. Early in the game Guybrush encounters Cobb, a character from Loom who wears an \"Ask me about Loom\" button, who's only response to Guybush's attempts at conversation are \"Aye\". That is, however, until Guybrush asks him about Loom. Cobb then launches into full advertisement on the games excellent story and wonderful soundtrack. Other references to Loom include a seagull from them game and the line \"I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?\" after Guybrush is fired from a cannon.[CR]The game also takes a shot at fellow developer Sierra. At one point in the game the player can make Guybrush fall off a mountain resulting in a game over screen similar to those found in Sierra's adventure games that says \"Oh, no! You've really screwed up this time! Guess you'll have to start over! Hope you saved the game!\". After a few moments Guybrush flys back up the mountain and the game continues as normal.[CR]Easter Eggs[CR]When the ' Important Looking Pirates' in the Scumm Bar ask Guybrush if he has any special skills, one dialogue option is to tell them that he can hold his breath for 10 minutes. Later, when Fester Shinetop throws you into the water, if you wait 10 minutes you'll see Guybrush drown, bloat up, and a load is required.[CR]The Special Edition also includes a few references to past Lucas-Arts titles:In the cave where Le Chuck's vessel is anchored you'll see the face of Manny Calavera, the protogonist of Grim Fandango, hidden in one of the skull-filled speleothems.At the Giant Monkey Head there's an idol statue of The Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition[CR]Special Edition Box Art[CR]On July 15, 2009, an updated \"Special Edition\" version of The Secret of Monkey Island was released on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and iPhone/iPod touch (the game was later released on the PlayStation Network on April 22, 2010). This re-imagining has remained completely faithful to the original game, featuring updated 1080i graphics, new music, hand drawn recreations of all the characters, items, & backgrounds, as well as full voice overs using the voice cast from The Curse of Monkey Island.[CR]The game has been given a streamlined interface designed to work better with a console controller. Players also have the ability to switch between the original version of the game and the special edition at any time with one button so that those who prefer the old style can still enjoy the experience. Moreover this version includes a built-in hint system for those who need it, which has three varying levels, but is a completely optional feature to use.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]OriginalMS-DOS 5.0 or higher1 Mb of EMS required (2 Mb recommended)386/33 DX (486 DX recommended)Sounblaster and 100% compatibles, Adlib, Roland MT 32Special EditionWindows XP or VistaProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3000Memory: 256 MB RAM, 512 MB for VistaGraphics: 128 MB with Shader Model 2.0 capabilityDirectX: 9.0c (March 2009)Hard Drive: 2.5GB free hard drive spaceSound: DirectX 9.0c compliant sound card[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Secret of the Silver Blades is the third game in the four-part series that had begun with Pool of Radiance. It is part of SSI's Gold Box series of games based on TSR's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules and set in the Forgotten Realms.[CR]Although this is the third part of the series, the gameplay mechanics have not changed. Only the setting has changed by introducing a new campaign set in the frozen North of the Forgotten Realms.[CR]A small number of changes have been implemented:Slightly improved graphicsLevel 7 spells are now available to MagesClerics can now access Level 6 spellsPlayers could import characters from Curse of the Azure BondsNo Overworld travel is available in this game[CR]Players starting fresh with this game did not need a previous party to enjoy it, although the difficulty level for the main campaign is made somewhat easier with a seasoned party. A pre-made party is available for use and new characters begin with an experience bonus to boost them up to the recommended minimum level required to survive the initial challenges.[CR]The game continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, it would become a tactical turn-based system with the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]Critics (and players) had complained about the cumbersome use of the translation wheel that had been included with both Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds as a means of copy protection. As a result of their criticism, SSI decided to scrap the translation wheel in favor of a challenge word system. When the game is started, a verification question is shown which directed the player to find the indicated word answer in either the rule book (the manual) or the included Adventurer's Journal. The disks themselves did not have any copy protection allowing players to make copies and play on them instead.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructions and an outline of the rulesAn Adventurer's Journal going into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the gameA Quick Reference card for commands[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The party arrives in the town of New Verdigris, sans their belongings, thanks to having been teleported there by the magic of the Well of Knowledge. The townspeople are responsible for their condition. In desperation, they had dumped all of the gems that they had mined from the nearby valley into it's waters and made a wish for saviors to come to New Verdigris. The Well answered their request, albeit to the stricteest letter of the wish and brought the party\u2014and only the party\u2014over.[CR]The townspeople quickly take them by wagon to New Verdrigris where they explain the situation and give them some money to buy new equipment to replace that which they had lost. It seems that the town is under attack by savage monsters that are slowly taking over the mine that is their life's blood. But this is a story that begins nearly three centuries earlier.[CR]Two brothers, Eldamar and Oswulf, constructed a castle in the valley overlooking a prosperous mine that would enable the founding of the original town of Verdigris. For twenty five years, the town prospered under the brothers' guidance. Unfortunately, it was not to last.[CR]Eldamar was a mage of no small measure and as he grew older, he feared the end that death would bring and began to research ways to cheat it. He would study on how to become a lich, an undead mage retaining all that he had learned. It was a corruption of life and, thus, an act of evil, but he was determined to undergo the transformation. However, as he neared the end of his studies, Oswulf discovered his work.[CR]Appalled and horrified, Oswulf attempted to steer him away from his decision. However, he was too late. One night soonafter, Eldamar completed the ritual and became a lich.[CR]Even then, Oswulf could not bring himself to slay his brother. He fled the castle and formed a group of adventurers - the Silver Blades - to find a way to imprison him. In the meantime, Eldamar saw this as a warning of the death he might still face. As a response, he called upon evil creatures to defend him and took on the name of Dreadlord.[CR]Eldamar's creatures laid waste to the town of Verdigris as everyone fled for their lives and as paranoia gripped Eldamar, he filled the castle he and his brother had built with lethal traps to protect himself. Oswulf and his group, however, were finally ready to confront the lich. They forced Eldamar's creatures from the town and made their way to the castle.[CR]But Oswulf still refused to raise a sword against Eldamar. And so, the mages and clerics that he had brought together cast a mighty spell. The enchantment encased the valley beneath an impregnable glacier, freezing everything within for all time. Oswulf sacrificed his own life to stand guard as a spirit over the castle's gate, forever to watch over it.[CR]The spell, however, did not catch all of Eldamar's followers by surprise. Some had been outside of the valley when it was frozen and saw what had become of their master. Determined to free him, they studied the enchantment, probed it, and attacked it until finally their descendants, now known as the Black Circle, managed to break it fifteen years ago. The glacier began to melt.[CR]Verdigris Valley, even after three centuries, was still home to many miners hoping to make their fortunes within the slopes of the mountains there. When the glacier began to melt, it would also reveal the mine that had brought wealth to Old Verdigris and they soon re-opened its shafts. New Verdigris was founded and the gems began to flow back out. However, the Black Circle's influence had also pushed the miners to open even deeper shafts into the mine, expanding it, and soon their subtle machinations bore fruit a month ago.[CR]The miners pushed deeper into the mountain until they had broken through into the dungeon of the old castle, releasing the monsters that were frozen there. They stood little chance against these terrors and so brought all of their wealth to the Well of Knowledge to make the wish they hoped would save them.[CR]Upon arrival, several problems immediately confront the party outside of their need for armor and weapons. The first of these is Marcus, the local mage who runs the magic store in New Verdigris. He also happens to be a secret member of the Black Circle. The other problem is that an ancient red dragon has taken over the Well of Knowledge shortly after the party arrives. After dealing with these, the adventurers go on to explore the ruins of Old Verdigris where they recover the Amulet of Eldamar and assault the headquarters of the Black Circle deep within its ruins.[CR]When they have broken the Black Circle's power on the surface, they head down into the mines where they meet an ancient dwarven cleric named Derf Strongarm within a temple dedicated to Tyr. As the last of the Silver Blades, he was tasked with protecting the Temple and in ensuring that it was warded against the Dreadlord. He can no longer leave the temple, but he urges the party to stop the Black Circle before it can successfully free the Dreadlord. To do so, they must collect the eight pieces of the Staff of Oswulf and reforge it.[CR]The pieces lie scattered within the mine and once they collect them all and reforge it, they are ready to enter the dungeon beneath the Castle. Making their way through the Dungeon and in defeating its many challenges including a mad spirit that challenges them with deadly riddles, they make their way into the glacier. There, they face giants, driders, and more of the Black Circle before arriving at the castle.[CR]Fighting their way upwards through its many levels and the traps that Eldamar had filled it with before the Valley was encased in ice, they finally confront Eldamar. Defeating him, they search out the soul gem within which his spirit is anchored. They destroy it, freeing Eldamar from his self-imposed curse, and watch as both he and his brother, Oswulf, ascend at last into the afterlife.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Secret of the Silver Blades follows after the events of Curse of the Azure Bonds, although experience with that game isn't necessary to enjoy this one. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use with few changes outside of an entirely different campaign than that of its predecessor.[CR]The party arrives at the town of New Verdigris as a result of the wish that the townspeople had made of the Well of Knowledge. However, as a result of how the spell was worded, the Well brings the party to New Verdigris without their equipment in a creative twist to the mechanic that strips imported parties of most of their goods as a balancing method against making the game too easy. At that point, imported parties will need to re-acquire another collection of arms and armor just as they had in Curse of the Azure Bonds.[CR]A vault is provided in New Verdigris for the players to store extra equipment and convert any platinum they find into gems which are useful with the Well of Knowledge.[CR]All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 2nd edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.Races[CR]Six races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world. Players can now select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.[CR]The races did not undergo any significant changes and had been presented in the same way as before in Pool of Radiance:Dwarves: Excellent warriors and often considered the best blacksmiths within the Forgotten Realms, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Gnomes: These are treated as shorter and slimmer versions of dwarves in the game, although they tend to be a little better as thieves.Halflings: Resistant to magic and poison, they are about half the size of humans and can make decent fighters and thieves.Human: The most common race in the Forgotten Realms, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.[CR]The alignment system remains unchanged from its previous implementation in Pool of Radiance:Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Paladins - These are holy fighters whose faith gives them resistances to spells and poison. They can also turn undead creatures as a cleric can at two levels below their current level. They have an aura that repels evil much like a Protection from Evil spell. They also gain the ability to Cure Disease once a week and can heal themselves of two points of damage per day. They can also use cleric spells when they reach 9th level. However, they must be Lawful Good and have more attribute restrictions than a fighter does.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield.[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.Locations[CR]There is no Overworld map in this game, but New Verdigris has a number of locations that the players will find useful as they explore the valley:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an areaVault - The party can store extra equipment here as well as convert platinum coins into gems for the Well of Knowledge.[CR]The Well of Knowledge, once freed from the ancient red dragon that had taken it over after the party's arrival, is also useful as a source of important information. By paying it gems, the players can ask it a number of questions and receive answers to them. It proves particularly useful in solving the riddles of the mad spirit within the Dungeon area of the game.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.[CR]",

They chose golf.[CR]Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Soccer is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.[CR]Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing. [CR]The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.",

                "plot": "[CR]Sensible World of Soccer (SWOS) is a 2D soccer game that combines direct control from a top-down perspective with a management component. Developed by Sensible Software, the game was the direct sequel to Sensible Soccer. It was critically acclaimed upon release due to its simple, fluid controls and huge database, which featured teams and players from every professional league in every country at the time. In all, the database contained 1600 teams and 22000 players.[CR]The large database was a result of the more lenient licensing laws from the period, which allowed the use of real player names without high expense. The only deliberate inaccuracy in the data was a deliberate misspelling of UEFA, the Union of European Football Associations, which was instead referred to as EUFA. Directional controls aside, only one context-sensitive button was required to control the game, allowing you to easily perform passes, shots, lobs, headers and diving headers. Much like the original Sensible Soccer, SWOS was praised for its ball physics and high camera position which showed more of the pitch. Both features allowed for easy passing and created a soccer game focused upon flow and speed.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Although originally released in 1992, the game continues to enjoy a high degree of critical respect. In 2006, it was named as one of the ten most important games ever by a panel that included game designers Warren Spector and Steve Meretzky. The panel argued that those ten games, which also included beloved titles such as Zork, SimCity, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Doom, should be archived to protect them from being lost to time. The hope is that the Library of Congress, who archive movies, books and other media, would accept the submissions as the start of a similar game canon. The game was released on multiple platforms to varied success, and there were numerous successful updates to the original. However, the 3D sequels that followed failed to achieve similar acclaim. In December 2007, Sensible World of Soccer was re-released with updated graphics on XBOX Live Arcade with a new online mode.[CR]Title Music[CR]Similar to Sensible Software's previous releases, SWOS had an original song recorded as its title music. Called \"Goalscoring Superstar Hero,\" the song was written by the late Richard Joseph and lead designer Jon Hare and performed by Jacky Read.[CR]",

When you are ready, you embark for the unknown. Once the New World is found, you explore it by sea and land, discovering major landmarks and making contact with the natives. Since your party can only carry a limited amount of food and gold, you will need to deal with the natives in order to keep your men alive. How you deal with them is up to you. You can approach them in peace and trade goods or gold for food and men or assassinate their Chief, kill the villagers until they are pacified and then take what you want as tribute. Welcome to the New WorldYou will be making several crossings of the Atlantic to return to Spain with the treasure you have acquired and expand your fleet. Each time you visit port, you can check your progress towards finding 100% of the land, rivers, natives, mines and special items, you can purchase new ships, hire more men, restock on food and visit the Queen to have your accomplishments evaluated. If she is pleased, you may be promoted and granted additional gold.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadow Fighter developed by the Italian team NA.P.S. and published by Gremlin Interactive is a fighting game comparabel to Mortal Kombat or SF2.[CR]It is considered to be one of the best fighting games on the Amiga and received very good ratings in several Amiga magazine reviews. The good level of sprite animation and the very good playability were highly praised as well as the separately smooth scrolling backgrounds, the great number of highly different fighters and the wide variety of standard and special moves of each character.[CR]NA.P.S a hitherto unknown and unheard developer team consisting of youths from Milan in Italy started to work on Shadow Fighter at the beginning of 1994. In November 1994 they simply sent in the game practically finished to Gremlin Interactive. Immediately Gremlin released the game without big advertising campaigns one month later at Christmas 1994. So the game development took less than a year and the game release was rather low-key beacause Gremlin had not much time to hype it up in the media.[CR]As usual at the time the game came in two different Amiga floppy drive versions. As an ECS/OCS version with 32 on-screen colors for weaker Amiga machines (like Amiga 500/600) and as an more colorful AGA version with 256 on-screen colors for enhanced Amiga machines (like Amiga1200/4000). The Amiga CD32 version came also out with 256 on-screen color graphics and additionally with CD soundtracks.[CR]AGA version (Amiga 1200)ECS/OCS version (Amiga 500)[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are 14 different fighting locations and 18 fighting characters in Shadow Fighter of which 16 are player-selectable and two are hidden. The two characters that can't be played are Pupazz the training dummy and Shadow the endboss of the game. But via a cheat both of them can be accessed as playable characters. Every fighter has from three up to seven special moves which can be executed by a certain joystick/pad combination.[CR]The game offers four distinct game modes:Championship Fight: This is a one-player game where you can choose one of the characters and try to fight through a tournament to finally meet and defeat the Shadow Fighter. There are three difficulty levels that can be set. Easy: Here you can only choose from the first six fighters and thereafter you will face up to ten opponents but you won't meet Shadow. Normal: Here you can choose from the first twelve fighters and you will have to win thirteen fights before you meet Shadow in the final fight. Hard: Here you can choose any of the sixteen selectable characters and you will have to win sixteen fights in your bid to fight Shadow.Training Battle: Here you will face Pupazz the practice dummy to train some special moves or combinations of any of the characters. But don't think Pupazz is defenceless and likes having the stuffing beaten out of him. He will defend himself vigorously with a variety of the most bizarre weapons like a flamethrower, a saw on an extendible arm or a gigantic fist that pops out of his neck.Single Battle: (Player vs. CPU) In this mode you select one of the 16 choosable characters and fight against a randomly chosen and computer controlled character. The CPU also selects randomly the location in which to fight.VS Battle: (Player vs. Player) Two players can pick any of the 16 selectable characters they wish and fight a duel - best out of three bouts wins. Also the location in which to fight can be chosen freely.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionSpecial MovesCody[CR]Cody is the son of a[CR]US Kuto arts master.[CR]He is twenty years old[CR]and was taught by his[CR]father at an early age.[CR]Having succeed his[CR]father as master at[CR]just 16, Cody devised[CR]moves his father[CR]believed impossible.[CR]Kuto Kick[CR]Fast Puch[CR]Flying Power Kick[CR]Kuto FireballElectra[CR]She is only 19[CR]years old, but the[CR]life on the streets[CR]of France taught[CR]her all she needs[CR]to know about[CR]self-preservation.[CR]Electric Body[CR]Power Launch[CR]Earth Power Energy[CR]Electric Boomerang[CR]Double Kick[CR]Spinning Jump[CR] Fakir[CR]He is a 21 years old[CR]Pakistani who is[CR]exploring the inner[CR]mind and life force.[CR]He combines magical[CR]knowledge with fighting[CR]ability which makes[CR]him an unpredictable[CR]character to fight[CR]against.[CR]Genie Hurricane[CR]Mystery Fire[CR]Teleport[CR]Magic CarpetKrhome[CR]Of unknown age and[CR]nationality he is a result[CR]of a DNA experiment.[CR]He has complete[CR]control over his[CR]cellular structure,[CR]allowing him to morph[CR]and stretch like none[CR]of the other fighters.[CR]Grabbing Gut[CR]Liquid Silver Attack[CR]Melting BodyKury[CR]He is a large sized[CR]and 30 years old[CR]Tibetan and no one[CR]is quite sure who or[CR]what he is.

Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords.

He has a life bar starting with 5 units.[CR]The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.[CR]A two-player co-operative game is also featured.

Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.",

It was developed by UK company Krisalis Software (sometimes referred to by their previous name, Teque Interactive). It is the follow up to Shadowlands, which featured a medieval fantasy setting instead.[CR]The game is best remembered for its dynamic lighting effects. Called \"photoscaping\" at the time, various sources of light will project a pre-determined radius of illumination around them. These include glowing projectiles from laser beams and flamethrowers as well as the space station's own failing light systems and spacesuit lamps belonging to individual characters. These lighting effects are calculated on the fly.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shadoworlds features a four-person team of pre-generated characters that the player puts together before starting the game: they feature various cyborgs and augmented humans and the game had a distinctive anime-like theme to its character art. The player can split this party up and send them off to complete tasks in different parts of the ship, but the game stays real-time throughout and characters left alone will potentially be in danger.[CR]The player can use darkness to their advantage to stay hidden from enemies, but they'll also need to use lights to examine or manipulate items in the environment. At any time, a character can activate the lamp inside their spacesuits for some illumination, but they'll need extra batteries to keep it on for an extended period. The team can find weapons and use them on the various hostile robots on the space station, though almost all of them require power to work: they can be recharged in various spots on the space station.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SimAnt is another in the series of simulation games released by Maxis in the years after the success of SimCity was realized. It gives a player the opportunity to control a colony by having direct control over a single ant and using him to work towards completing certain goals. There are three types of games in SimAnt.Experimental: a sandbox mode with no objectives.Quick Game: The player must overpower the rivaling red ant colony.Full Game: Invade the house and cause the owner to evacuate.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player maintains control over a single yellow ant in the black colony; control can be swapped to another ant by simply double-clicking on it. The player's ant can pick up food, order other ants to follow him, and leave a scent trail for the colony to follow to food or enemies.The WorldThe backyard to be conquered.[CR]The SimAnt world is represented by 3 levels of detail. First, there is an ant farm perspective used to see what is going on in the underground colonies. This is useful for tracking the larvae and food supply of a colony. Second is the above ground view, which shows all activity on the surface in a single grid area of the world map. This is where hazards, or disasters, will present themselves.[CR]The world map is represented by the backyard and inside kitchen of a human family that is active throughout the course of the game. In the full game, the victory objective is to traverse the backyard with new colonies until a colony can be created in the kitchen.Expanding[CR]The unit creation system in SimAnt is based on an ant colony's caste system, with the player controlling amounts of workers, soldiers, and breeders to be born. Behavior--split into digging, foraging, and fighting--may also be modified. When new queens are born, they have wings that allow them to fly to other areas of the SimAnt world. These newborns can dig below ground and start broods, allowing the colony to start breeding new worker ants to support the colonies' needs. Through this expansion, it is possible to reach the inside of the house on the other side of the starting point in the backyard.Disasters[CR]Although there are no disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes that the ant colonies will have to deal with, there are events that can occur that can spell disaster for your ant and colony. From time to time, a human will mow the lawn, which will wipe out all ants above the surface when it passes over the grid space. Children will run around the grass, and their footprints will smash any ants in their path when they reach the lawn grid. Rain will sometimes wash away ants and the scent trails you have laid down for the rest of your colony, as well as flooding portions of the nest. Indoors, electric sockets or ant poison can be found in abundance. Spiders and other insects pose a threat throughout all levels; if killed, though, these enemies provide a good deal of food for the colony.Ant WarsAn underground colony.[CR]In all game types, there is a competing colony of red ants trying to reach the same victory goals that the player is working towards. The red colony isn't superior in any mechanical way; the enemies are simply red to help the player distinguish friend from foe. When a red and black ant meet, they engage in a quick skirmish that will leave one of the ants dead, with the victorious ant most likely tired and unable to fight much more. In order to take over a red ant colony, the player must leave a scent trail that will lead other worker and soldier ants to it, so that a steady stream of black ants can lay siege to the underground network and eventually kill the breeding queen.[CR]Once the colony is taken over, a queen can be placed in the vacated network of tunnels, or the area can be deserted and left unused. In the Quick Game mode, the only objective is to take over the neighboring red ant colony in the same grid space - once that has been accomplished, the game is finished.[CR]",

Additionally, the player was able to produce incredibly voracious, hardy animals with extremely high birth rates, which would quickly multiply beyond control, devouring the biomass of the planet (both animal and plant alike), and would then turn on their own as cannibals, leaving behind nothing but a barren rock of a world from what was once a verdent eden.[CR]It is highly likely that SimLife, SimAnt, and SimEarth's development culminated in the design of Spore, as Spore contains elements of all three titles in its gameplay.[CR]",

Surprisingly a magical portal appears when the book hits the floor. Being a ordinary teenager, Simon does not know what to do. However, that changes when Chippy decides to enter. Not wanting to lose his faithful dog, Simon decides to follow. After entering the portal, Simon finds himself in another world - more precisely he finds himself in a cauldron. It appears that some goblins see him as their lunch! Regretting the fact that he entered the portal, he manages to escape. Simon finds that a wizard called Calypso has been kidnapped by another wizard who goes by the name of The Evil Sordid. The only person who will send Simon back is Calypso, and so his quest begins, armed with humour, rudeness and sarcasm.[CR]Simon is voiced by UK based comedian and actor Chris Barrie who is the star of the popular TV series Red Dwarf.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game.

Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of \"Maggie\", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the \"spin the wheel\" minigame.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Level oneLocation: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: MaggieLevel twoLocation: Shopping MallBoss: Ms. BotzHelper: MargeLevel threeLocation: CarnivalBoss: Sideshow BobHelper: LisaLevel fourLocation: MuseumSub-Boss: TyrannosaurusBoss: Dr. MonroeHelper: HomerLevel fiveLocation: Power PlantHelper: Maggie, Marge, Lisa, and HomerNo Boss[CR]",

In this game, the enemies are trapped by shooting snow at them: when enough snow has been thrown at an enemy, they become a snowball that can be pushed around and/or kicked. If a snowball is left idle for too long, the enemy will break free. Kicking the snowball causes it to ricochet around the stage, taking out any foes in its path. The snowball (and the enemy within it) is destroyed upon hitting the bottom walls of the screen. Other snowballs can be launched when a moving snowball hits it. This creates the ability to setup chain reactions. The best way to rack up points is to create a chain reaction that kills every enemy on screen with a single kick of a snowball.[CR]When enemies are destroyed, they leave behind a food item (often sushi or ice cream) worth points upon collecting. If you manage to do a 100% chain reaction, large tickets appear from the top of the screen, worth 10000 points each. You can move on to the next stage/screen after killing all enemies. Time is limited in each screen- taking too long results in an invincible monster appearing to chase and kill you (another similarity to Bubble Bobble).[CR]There are several power ups (resembling potions) available to the player, which spawn at random from a dead enemy. Red potions increase the speed of your character; Blue potions increase the strength of your snow (meaning you can make enemies into snowballs faster), and Yellow increases your range. Green potions engage a bonus stage that fills the screen with new enemies, each representing a letter of the word \"BONUS\". Each one you kill results in you earing the corresponding letter- getting all of them results in a 1-UP. The final power up inflates your character into a baloon, which makes you invincible and able to move throughout the stage quickly- any contact with enemies kills them.[CR]Every 10 stages ends in a boss encounter.[CR]The NES version of the game introduces cut scenes and a more fleshed out story. However, this version has many of the stages and enemy layouts altered from the arcade version. A Mega Drive version came out in Japan and Europe and is something of a collectiors item- garnering high prices on Auctions. An official sequel called Snow Bros 2: With New Elves came out shortly after. A homebrew Snow Bros 3 was made and distributed in South America.[CR]",

Soccer Kid uses his soccerball to attack enemies, and is able to control it and send it flying in different directions. If he loses the ball, he can simply summon it back to his feet by holding down the kick button.[CR]The title screen for most versions of Soccer Kid would allow the player to change the colors on the uniform Soccer Kid wears in-game to closely match their supported team. For the Super Nintendo version, the player could cycle through shirt and short colors with the shoulder buttons. [CR]For the US Super Nintendo release, the game was renamed The Adventures of Kid Kleets. The PAL version had in-game advertising for Golden Grahams cereal. The Japanese Super Famicom version of the game had new art for Soccer Kid, rendering him in a more anime style on the title screen, box art and cutscenes (the sprite remained the same).[CR]Development[CR]The original concept for the game was by Dean Lester when the company wanted to do a Mad Professor Mariarti sequel.

Thus empowered, he has to defeat Borfs minions.[CR]Space Ace II is a essentially a cartoon strip in which our hero will encounter numerous hazards. You have to avoid traps and enemies by pressing the right key at the right time: cursor keys for movements, Insert key to shoot. You never control Dexter directly, you just choose an appropriate direction. Each of the 27 seconds-long scenes requires one to three keystrokes. If your decision is wrong, the cartoon will end with a death animation, and Dexter will lose one of his three lives. So youre basically trying to keep the strip running. Timing is crucial; you will need to press keys in the exact second. Luckily, youre allowed to save your progress at four fixed points.[CR]Space Ace II is ported to the PC from the original arcade Laserdisc version. The result is a cut version due to space restraints. Although Space Ace II comes on 12(!) low density 5 1/4\" discs, most scenes are shortened noticeably.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace is Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous branching pathways. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a \"miss\" into its narrative and continue on.[CR]Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the \"collection of disjointed scenes\" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.[CR]The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the \"Infanto Ray\", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.[CR]The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a \"Shoot\" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.[CR]Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.[CR]Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to \"Energize\". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.[CR]Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.[CR]Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.[CR]Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES version[CR]The SNES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.[CR]With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.[CR]Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace \"Dexter\", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX\u00ae: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX\u00ae: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]",

[CR]The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.",

They fight against an alien foe known as Genestealers. The Genestealers are fast and equipped with teeth and claws that can easily tear through the Terminator's armour. The fights between them take place amongst the long corridors of old abandoned spaceships called Space Hulks.Gameplay[CR]The Planning Screen[CR]The game consists of 51 missions, divided up into tutorials, stand-alone and campaign missions. Mission objectives include actions such as exterminations, object retrievals, and protection. The number of Terminators the player will have to manage varies from one to two squads of five men each. The Terminator can be controlled from two different screens, the Planning screen and the Terminator View Screen. The Planning screen offers a top-down view over the map and allows the player to issue commands to all Terminators. In the Terminator View screen the player can see the first-person perspective of five Terminators, but only fully control one at a time. The game is in real-time, but players can pause the game by \"Freezing\" the game. While the game is Freeze mode the player can still issue out commands, but pressured to issue out commands fast does not go away, as a timer is ticking down to when freeze time will end.[CR]Terminator View screen[CR]The AI on the Terminators is limited. They will automatically fire on enemies in front of them, but when attacked from the side or from behind, they will not react and face the threat. Instead they will almost immediately die.TriviaThe Terminators are from the Deathwing company of the Dark Angels Space Marines chapter.Set in the same universe as the Warhammer 40k franchise.Opening theme by D-Rok titled \"Get Out Of My Way\"[CR]",

It is a remake of Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter, the first game in the semi-popular Space Quest series from Sierra, starring Roger Wilco as the chief protagonist and sole playable character.[CR]Sierra re-released the first chapter in the Space Quest series in a new VGA style with 256-color VGA graphics, a new point-and-click icon style interface, and digital sound supporting all of the major sound card brands of the day. In the early 1990s, Sierra released a number of VGA remakes for several of their adventure game franchises, including Leisure Suit Larry and Police Quest. The story remains exactly the same, however a few puzzles had to be reworked due to the new interface, as opposed to the original text-based parser interface. Another notable difference is that the color of Roger's hair changed from brown to blond.[CR]Those attempting to play the game on modern systems often deal with a number of time bugs caused by processing speeds that obliterate any of the game's original programming. Fortunately, a number of publicly available player-made mods exist to ensure that the game can be played well into the future.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]As the game begins, the Arcada is returning home to Xenon after successfully developing the Star Generator. Unbeknownst to the crew aboard, they have been followed by a sinister craft. The unknown ship, bearing a strong resemblance to a grasshopper, seizes the Arcada in its appendages.[CR]The game then transitions to our hero's entrance, as Roger Wilco is seen loitering in the halls of the Arcada. No sooner are we introduced to the Space Quest star do we hear a female voice announce that the Arcada is 15 minutes from self-destruction - and counting![CR]Soon, Roger discovers several of his crewmates...lying in a pool of their own blood, brutally murdered. It is not long before those responsible make their presence known. They are the Sariens. Former citizens of Earnon, the Sariens are space pirates who travel the universe, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. Should they gain possession of the Star Generator, one cannot begin to fathom the torrent of violence they would unleash upon their former homeworld. However, they first plan to use this weapon of ulimate power on another target - Xenon![CR]Roger Wilco thus embarks on his heroic journey to rescue his home planet from the vicious onslaught of the Sariens, whether he wants to or not.[CR]",

It is widely regarded as the best game in the Space Quest series, and was selected as the 1989 Adventure Game of the Year by the Software Publishers of America.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] This time, Roger *is* the trash.[CR]When we last left Roger, he was floating through space in a cryogenic sleep chamber, hoping to get rescued. Rescue does come, but unfortunately in the form of a interstellar garbage hauler. Seen as just a piece of space debris, Roger and his ship are sucked up to be disposed of. Fortunately for Roger, this manages to activate his chamber's awakening function and he is able to make his escape.[CR]  Pay me if you want to live.[CR]Through Roger's weird luck, his escape finds him at the helm of a new ship, the Aluminum Mallard, which he decides to take on a tour of his current star system. Stopping at a nearby planet, Phleebhut, Roger makes his way to a local tourist destination. After perusing the knick knacks and while on his way back to his ship, Roger encounters the Annihilator droid, Arnoid the Terminator. Arnoid is there to collect an unpaid debt in Roger's name from the Labion Terror Beast Whistle he purchased from the Gippazoid Novelty Company's mail order catalogue back in SQ2. Unfortunately Roger doesn't have the money so Arnoid is forced to terminate him.[CR]  Monolith Burger[CR]Through his sheer prowess, or perhaps dumb luck, Roger manages to defeat the droid and quickly leaves the planet. Shaken, and a bit hungry, Roger stops off at a Monolith Burger for a quick bite. After ordering the fun meal and obtaining a nifty decoder ring as the prize, Roger decides to play the new Astro Chicken Arcade Game from ScumSoft. Being pretty good at video games, Roger manages to obtain the high score and also unlocks a mysteriously coded message. Using his new decoder ring Roger discovers that the makers of the game, and the Space Quest series, are being held captive by ScumSoft and forced to write computer games.[CR]   Preparing for a robot duel [CR]Being the noble hero that he is, Roger sets off to free the Two Guys from Andromeda. Again, through his incredible skill, or perhaps just even more blind dumb luck, Roger sneaks his way into ScumSoft and frees the two guys. Unfortunately he finds himself trapped by the evil CEO who forces Roger to face him in a life size Rock 'Em Sock 'Em duel.[CR]   Wilco, Two Guys, and Williams[CR]Yet again, Roger manages to prevail and escapes with the guys onto his ship. After a fierce but quick space battle, Roger escapes with the two guys and it looks like they're home free. Unfortunately Roger's luck catches up with him and they all get sucked into a black hole. Fortunately, instead of being annihilated, they are instead transported to some far off and strange galaxy. Landing on the only planet that can sustain life, they touch down and happen across a strange guy named Ken Williams who happens to own a software company himself. He immediately hires the two guys to make a game about their adventures with offers of riches and glory. Unfortunately they already have a janitor, so Roger gets back in his ship and sets off for sights unknown.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Space Quest 3 utilized Sierra's new SCI engine which brought an entirely new parser and updated graphics and sound card support. This game brought something new to the adventure game world: mouse support. Though you still interacted primarily through the arrow keys and a text parser, it was also possible to utilize the mouse for movement and inventory interaction.[CR]Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for those hardcore gamers, this game still allowed many irreversible deaths and dead end puzzles.[CR]Astro Chicken [CR] Astro Chicken Title Screen[CR]Astro Chicken was a minigame included within Space Quest 3, that featured a hidden message randomly displayed when the player received a high score. The goal of the game was to land a chicken on a trampoline. Upon doing so the chicken would let out a resounding \"Bacock!\", and then you would repeat. The game has similarities to Lunar Lander but the chicken rebounds from the trampoline if it lands too hard.[CR]The name of the game is considered a possible parody of the identically named thought experiment by theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson. A sequel to Astro Chicken (Ms. Astro Chicken) was included as a playable minigame in Space Quest IV. The Astro Chicken developer, Scum Soft, is almost certainly a reference to Sierra's adventure game arch rival, LucasArts, and their ScummVM engine.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game received very good critical reviews from the various media at the time generally getting 4 out of 5 or around 80% mark reviews.[CR]Requirements[CR]8088/8086 CPU512KB RAM CGA, EGA, Hercules, MCGA, Tandy/PCjr, or VGA graphicsAdlib, Game Blaster, IBM Music Feature Card, PC speaker, PS/1 Audio Card, Roland MT-32, Sound Blaster, Tandy DAC, or Tandy/PCjr sound cardKeyboard, optional Mouse[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Quest IV is a 1991 point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line. It is the fourth game in the Space Quest series, and stars janitor turned hero, Roger Wilco.[CR]On March 4, 1991, Space Quest IV was released on six high-density floppy disks. In December 1992, Space Quest IV was re-released on CD-ROM with full speech. The game cost more than $1,000,000 to produce; fortunately, the game was quite successful and sold more copies than the three previous Space Quest games combined.[CR]Space Quest IV was the first game in the Space Quest series to both come with a CD and include full audio dialog, which was voiced by Gary Owens of Laugh-In fame. The game had 256-color hand-painted VGA graphics, unlike the 16-color EGA graphics of previous Space Quests (although EGA was still an option for players with older systems). Additionally, it was one of the first games to use video-captured animation.[CR]The game engine employed the next generation of the Sierra Creative Interface (SCI), first used in the development of Space Quest III. However, this game did not feature a parser interface; instead, Space Quest IV was a point-and-click adventure game in its entirety.[CR]Space Quest IV is also notable for being the last Space Quest game to be designed and programmed by both of the series' creators, The Two Guys from Andromeda (Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy).[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Come with us, Roger Wilco[CR]In Space Quest IV, Roger must travel to to the future and the past (noted by the game sequel or prequel in which our faithful hero happens to find himself) and influence characters and events in order to prevent his untimely demise in the future by the order of the evil Sludge Vohaul. In the game's non-playable introduction, Roger is taken outside by the so-called \"Sequel Police\" for a holo-message from Vohaul. Following the message, the Sequel Police attempt to execute our protagonist, but Roger is saved in the nick of time by two mysterious men (one of whom being Roger Wilco's son), who open a portal and thus begin his time-traveling adventure.Zondra, the leader of the Babes[CR]Along the way, Roger visits many locations - including Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros and Space Quest I - The Sarien Encounter. The graphics and music change in order to reflect the period in which Roger finds himself. For instance, in the Space Quest I portion of the game, Roger is a handsomely-drawn 256-color VGA character in a CGA world.[CR]There are plenty of easter eggs and minigames along the way, including the ability to play Ms. Astro Chicken (the sequel to Space Quest III's Astro Chicken playable minigame) in an arcade. Some of the game's most beloved moments are found by using the icons, a set of tools for getting around in the game, in unusual ways to generate unusual reactions. For example, if you clicked on Roger with the hand icon the narrator would say: \"Hey, this is a family game!\"[CR] [CR]",

At least no honest man.[CR]Special Forces let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.[CR]16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.",

The game is meant to be played cooperatively (including friendly fire), but when playing alone only Sortice is present in the game.Spell Bound is a platformer with the main goal being to reach the end of the level without being killed by the various enemies. Players have six spells at their disposal which basically boil down to different weapon systems as well as levitation. Each spell except the standard attack drains manna which, exactly like life energy, is refilled by collecting power ups; either lying on the ground or in locked chests which have to be unlocked by finding the correct key first. Other useful objects include crystals for disrupting energy fields, bombs to blow up stone pillars, or a jet pack. Each character can carry one object at a time and, when trying to cast a spell without having the needed manna, will experience negative effects like reversed controls.",

                "plot": "Spirit of Excalibur is an adventure/strategy game based on Arthurian legend.   It uses elements from Malory's Le Morte Darthur, John Boorman's film Excalibur, and modern-day retellings of the story.  Continuing where the traditional tale ended, Spirit of Excalibur depicts a new king and a new group of Knights of the Round Table attempting to end the threat of the sorceress Morgan le Fay once and for all. Similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth, Spirit uses an overhead map for character and army movement, and a close up side view to show specific locations and dialogue.  It also has an army combat screen, showing all fighting troops in a medium overhead view.  The game is divided into five chapters.  Within each chapter the player must guide characters between locations to fight, gather allies, or collect items.  Because items (such as strength potions or alchemical reagents like eye of newt) carry over between chapters, it is important to gather as much as possible as early as possible.  The chapters provide specific challenges: for example, in the third chapter the king and most of the Knights of the Round Table are trapped in Camelot, and the player must use their limited forces outside the castle to free them before invading Saxons conquer England. Though well regarded, the game was considered so difficult that Virgin eventually began to package the hint book with the boxed game.  Spirit was followed the next year by Vengeance of Excalibur, which featured a new Spanish setting and more story driven, smaller-scale combat.[CR]",

It features a huge universe to be discovered, detailed character generation and development, a mass of items, some exotic aliens and tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.[CR]The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called \"The Triangle\" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain \"Blackbeard\", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.[CR]Game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity.[CR]Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.[CR]Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.[CR]After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship![CR]While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).[CR]While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire.[CR]Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.[CR]One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events.[CR]There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.[CR]All in all, the game play is simple to learn, but quite complex and addictive despite the crude graphics and nearly non-existent sound, as the game emphasizes on character development and atmosphere.",

Later ports of the game were also released for the PC and Atari STE but lacked the quality of the original release. Stardust came about when Finnish programmer Harri Tikkanen began early work on a pinball game, he would later discover that Swedish developer Digital Illusions was about to release a very similar game called Pinball Dreams and so he was forced to come up with a brand new concept which would become Stardust.[CR]The gameplay is heavily inspired by the arcade hit, Asteroids. Stardust expands on this formula by allowing the player to collect numerous weapons throughout the game's 30 levels and then to power them up over time. Certain bosses and enemies are weak against particular weapons. Some of the levels change up the formula by having the spaceship fly through a tunnel while shooting enemies and avoiding oncoming debris.[CR]Another of the game's distinguishing features is its sense of humor. The story features a mad professor, secret agents disguised as meteorites, a final level named after a Finnish town, and a princess named after a brand of margarine.Reception[CR]On release, the game received positive reviews from many outlets, Amiga Computing and Amiga Force gave the game 93 and 92 percent receptively. The main criticism of the game was the steep learning curve which made it prohibitively difficult for a lot of players. The team took this into account and decided to revamp Stardust by improving the game and adding new content. This lead to the creation of Super Stardust released for the Amiga 1200 in 1994.[CR]",

Through investigation, Interstel determines that the Spemin technology is not their own and that they have obtained it from somewhere on the other side of a flux (wormhole). Interstel commissions a force to visit this area, called the Cloud Nebula, and find a way to nullify the Spemin technology.[CR]Starflight 2 is a space exploration game that contains much of the interface from the first starflight game. This includes crew management, ship improvement, resource collection, planet landings, alien diplomacy and exploration of a new galaxy. Much of the gameplay takes place via a standard interface that allows access to ship stations. Landing on a planet however will shift to an overhead view and the player manually controls his rover while searching for objects of interest. [CR]New to Starflight 2 is trading, alien races will now buy and sell unique items at different prices, it is no longer necessary to return to the Interstel starport to sell resources. As mentioned, the galaxy itself and the alien races that inhabit it are also new. New technologies exist for the player such as Blasto Pods (torpedoes); a devastating weapon, and Jump Pods; which will transport anywhere on the starmap.",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ryu and Ken return for more martial arts combat![CR]Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is a 2D fighting game developed and distributed by Capcom for arcades (running CPS-1 hardware) on February 6, 1991.[CR]The sequel to the 1987 fighting game Street Fighter, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is credited to laying down the framework for the traditional fighting game genre, as well as kicking off the \"fighting game revolution\" of the 1990s. Along with introducing smoother control over each player's character (as the control in previous fighting games are \"stiff\"), Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is the first versus fighting game to allow the player to select his character out of a pre-determined set of fighters, each with their own unique special abilities.[CR]Players pick one of eight worldwide warriors (martial artists Ryu and Ken from the previous installment, Japanese sumo wrestler E. Honda, female Chinese martial artist Chun-Li, Brazilian beast man Blanka, Russian professional wrestler Zangief, American former Special Forces operative Guile, and Indian Yoga master Dhalsim) as they travel the world, trying to defeat the other seven warriors and progress through the martial arts tournament.[CR]Due to its popularity, the game spawned numerous updates throughout the '90s (starting with Street Fighter II': Champion Edition), enough for it to be considered its own game series. The original game also received ports to certain computer and console system of the early '90s, most notably the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The success of the game also spawned both a Japanese animated film (which later had its own game) and an American live-action film (which later had its own fighting game), two animated series (the Japanese Street Fighter II V and the American Street Fighter), and a Gottlieb-developed pinball adaptation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ryu (left) getting kicked in the head by Guile (right).[CR]In Street Fighter II, players engage in one-on-one martial arts combat (with either computer opponents or other players) with their chosen fighter. Each fighter has their own life bar, which depletes after each successful attack. The winner of the round is decided after either the game's countdown timer expires or one of the fighters is \"knocked out\" (by emptying their life bar).[CR]Typically a match is won by winning two out of three rounds, but a Double KO (in which both players are knocked out simultaneously) or a Draw Game (when the game's timer expires and both players having equal vitality remaining) extends the match for another round (while no victor is declared). If the match extends to ten total rounds (four total rounds in the game's updates) and no winner is declared, then both players lose the match.[CR]When players are facing off against computer opponents, they must progress through each opponent throughout the game and defeat them. Losing a match allows players to continue, in which players can pick a different fighter (if desired) and restart the fight. If a player manages to defeat all seven opponents, he must face three Grand Masters: American former professional boxer Balrog, Spanish cage fighter Vega, and the master of Muay Thai, Sagat (the final boss from the previous game). It is revealed after defeating Sagat that the player must fight the mysterious dictator M. Bison to win the tournament. Each of the eight playable fighters have unique endings showing the aftermath of their battle with M. Bison.[CR]Fights between players and CPU opponents can be interrupted by another player (causing the message \"HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!\" to appear), which triggers a new one-on-one match between the two players in which the winner moves on to fight the current CPU opponent.Controls[CR]Like the basic version of the original Street Fighter, players have a eight-directional joystick (used for movement) and six buttons in a horizontal rectangular formation (used for attacking). Each of the six buttons corresponds to a different attack type (three \"Punch\" attacks and three \"Kick\" attacks) and strength/speed (two Light attacks, two Medium attacks, and two Heavy attacks). Light attacks are safer to perform (despite dealing less damage) while Heavy attacks deal powerful damage (despite leaving the fighter in a vulnerable state if the attack misses).[CR]While walking in one of two directions by holding the joystick in one of two positions (Back for walking away from their opponent and Forward for walking towards their opponent), players can crouch down by holding the joystick in one of the three downward positions (Down, Down-Back, and Down-Forward) and jump up by tapping the joystick in one of the three upward positions (Up for jumping up, Up-Back for jumping away from their opponent, and Up-Forward for jumping towards their opponent). Certain attacks miss when their ducked under or jumped over, while these maneuvers also give new attack options (such as, for crouching players, an anti-air uppercut and a leg sweep capable of knocking down opponents).[CR]Players who are hit with multiple attacks in quick succession have a high chance of becoming \"dizzied\". Visualized by a halo of stars around the fighter's head, dizzied opponents are stunned and cannot move or attack until they either receive another hit or \"break out\" of their dizzy state (by tapping multiple buttons and moving the joystick around).Advanced Abilities[CR]Using the joystick, players can also perform blocks (known in Japanese version as \"guards\") by holding the joystick in either the Back position (for standing blocks) or Down-Back position (for crouching blocks). Blocked players receive no damage or knockback/knockdown from normal attacks, but are more vulnerable to Grab Attacks (which throw the opponent in a desired direction, damaging them in the process). Grabs are performed by holding either Back or Forward on the joystick (the direction choosing which way to throw the opponent) and pressing Medium Punch or Heavy Punch while the opponent is very close and not jumping.[CR]Along with a variety of normal attacks (some of which are different depending on how close the opponent is), each fighter has a set of secret \"special moves\" performed by specific joystick and button combinations. These techniques have special abilities (such as throwing a projectile across the screen or hurling the fighters at their opponents) and can deal more damage (even slightly damaging blocked opponents, later known as \"chip damage\").[CR]Originally determined as a bug, players can \"cancel\" attack animations into other attacks, allowing players to chain several attacks and special moves into a \"combo\". This technique was soon adapted as a standard feature of the fighting game franchise and was expanded throughout the Street Fighter series.Bonus StagesRyu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).[CR]After defeating every three CPU opponents, players participate in a bonus stage for additional score. Each bonus stage has their own unique objective:Wreck a car located in the middle of the stage with a variety of attacks in a limited amount of time, in similar vein to the bonus stage in Final Fight. As pieces of the car fly off, players often have to change attacks and positions.Break wooden barrels that drop down above the middle of the stage. Barrels roll towards each direction and can knock down the player if it hits them.Destroy a pyramid of metal oil drums stacked in the middle of the stage in a limited amount of time. The drums take more damage to destroy than the barrels and can be knocked back (only if barrels below them are destroyed). Players can be knocked down by the oil drums, either through impact (when the oil drums are knocked back) or by fire (standing on an oil drum at the wrong time, since the oil inside is being burned).[CR]Most console ports of the game (and its updates) replaced the third bonus stage with a large pyramid of bricks to destroy in a limited amount of time. Each section of the pyramid is impacted by attacks and is destroyed after a certain amount.[CR]While it is usually performed by one player, a second player can join in (resetting the stage) to assist. Players receive score per each hit on the objective, and both players receive a bonus score for successfully completing the objective.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game features eight playable characters, all with their own unique set of special moves (with the exception of Ken, who has the same special moves as Ryu) and fight locales. Both players can not pick the same character (a restriction that was lifted after the game's first revision).Playable CharactersRyuKenChun-LiE. HondaZangiefBlankaGuileDhalsimNon-Playable Boss CharactersBalrog (known as M. Bison in the Japanese versions)Vega (known as Balrog in the Japanese versions)SagatM. Bison (known as Vega in the Japanese versions)[CR]Ports[CR]Outside of the constant rehashes, the original Street Fighter II was ported to some consoles and computer systems in the 90s:The game's first and main port was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in June 10, 1992 (in Japan), July 15, 1992 (in North America), and December 17, 1992 (in Europe). It's one of the first games to have a dedicated Versus Mode (allowing players to select stages and player handicaps). The game also had mirror match support as a cheat code. It was later re-released digitally for the Virtual Console on the Wii (on December 25, 2006) and Wii U (on August 22, 2013).Between 1992 and 1993, the game was ported to a variety of computers by Creative Materials (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and PCs running MS-DOS) and Tiertex Design (ZX Spectrum). All of these ports were published by U.S. Gold in Europe only (the only exception being the PC version, which received an obscure North America release) and had numerous issues regarding audio, graphics, and gameplay.A handheld port was released for the Game Boy in September 1995. Including some assets and moves from later Street Fighter II releases (though resembling more like the original) and a Survival Mode, the port has numerous restrictions (including reliance on only two attack buttons and three absent characters: E. Honda, Dhalsim, and Vega). Like other fighting games for the Game Boy, multiplayer requires a Link Cable and multiple copies of the game and device. This version has full Super Game Boy support, including enhanced border backgrounds (that change depending on the current stage), limited color support (mostly for lifebars), and same-console multiplayer.The game was ported to the PlayStation in a compilation including Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, released in October 31, 1998 (in North America as Street Fighter Collection 2), December 3, 1998 (in Japan as Capcom Generations 5), and May 1999 (in Europe, published by Virgin, same name as NA). This port includes a Versus and Training Mode, optional arranged soundtracks, and a \"Super Vs. Mode\" (which allows players to fight with different character versions, later expanded on in Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition). This version was also used in the Saturn release (released in Japan only at the same release date), the Capcom Classics Collection compilation (released on September 27, 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox), and the Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded compilation (released on October 24, 2006 for the PlayStation Portable).It was also ported to mobile devices in 2004 for Japan only.[CR]",

[CR]The game's interface is relatively easy and fun to use. You have your own garage as the interface itself. Options are in the form of the garage's elements such as the clock for the game's main menu and the newspaper as your source for buying cars and parts. Add to that a third person with an attitude that talks to you as you play It's really a neat idea by which up to now, no other racing games have that style.

Tune it for maximum performance and off you go. In the diner where other hotshots are waiting to take your prized possession, you race for money and pink slips and if you win, you get to take home their cars! [CR]The game's interface is relatively easy and fun to use. You have your own garage as the interface itself. Options are in the form of the garage's elements such as the clock for the game's main menu and the newspaper as your source for buying cars and parts. Add to that a third person with an attitude that talks to you as you play It's really a neat idea by which up to now, no other racing games have that style. You feel that you're living a virtual world as opposed to just going from menu to menu. Another realistic part is the ability for you to sell your car and haggle",

You start off managing Folkford United, the worst team in the country, with players including Brian Evans, Nicky Moody and Bruce Roberts, and rival teams include Oldcastle, Marwick and Stoke Berry.[CR]The second difference is the lack of statistics for player details. Instead, sentences such as 'best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for 100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around 150,000' are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is.[CR]Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism.[CR]The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful.[CR]If you own either Emlyn Hughes' International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.",

You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. [CR]24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.[CR]The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.",

It follows Champion Edition (which first allowed players to play as the four Grand Masters Sagat, Balrog, Vega and M. Bison) and Turbo: Hyper Fighting (which increased the speed and balanced the game further). The most notable addition are four brand new characters: Cammy, Deejay, T.Hawk and Fei Long. It would eventually be followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo Edition, considered the definitive Super Street Fighter II.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This remake of  Street Fighter II featured a new scoring system that kept track of combos, first attacks, and reversals. Additionally, four new characters join the returning twelve characters from the original. Super Street Fighter II is also the first game in the SFII series to give full move sets to the boss characters. Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.[CR]Aside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire.[CR]Criticism[CR]For all the additions and improvements Super Street Fighter II makes over  Street Fighter II: Turbo, its biggest failing is arguably that it does not include the same degree of speed that made Street Fighter II: Turbo such a hit. It is perhaps for this very reason that, in most cases, this game is overlooked in preference to its follow-up -  Super Street Fighter II: Turbo.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Returning charactersSSFII featured four new characters Ryu Ken Masters E.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hoped to be a rival to Mario and Sonic, Superfrog was the Amiga's very own icon. The game was a side-scrolling platformer with 24 levels across six different environments, developed by Team17 before their success with the Worms franchise.[CR]Plot & Setting[CR]The game takes after typical fantasy cliches, with a prince and bride-to-be despised by an evil witch, who kidnaps the bride and transforms the prince into a (sentient, but physically normal) frog. At first hopeless, he is sitting by a river when a magic potion floats by and, upon drinking it, he is transformed into the SuperFrog of the title.The first five worlds of SuperFrog.[CR]In the first world, Enchanted Forest, SuperFrog hunts for the golden key required to unlock the witch's castle. After searching the Spooky Castle in the second world, he is \"captured by Colin the Troll\", caged and sent to a circus. His escape from the circus fills the third world, Fun Land, with the frog-prince leaving via a time machine he discovers. This takes him to the fourth world, Ancient Pyramid, but he is unable to reverse the time machine and freezes himself in suspended animation until the present day. He awakes in the fifth world, Ice Caverns, eventually arriving at a rocket which he uses to travel to the final world, the witch's Space Station. After travelling through the station he arrives at the witch's lair and rescues his bride.[CR]In the end cutscene, the two share a kiss once again, but instead of restoring the prince it transforms the bride into a frog as well.In-Game AdvertisingLucozade shown in detail in the intro.[CR]The drink Lucozade is what gives SuperFrog his powers, and a detailed bottle is shown during the intro sequence. Cans are also available as pickups throughout levels (providing substantial point bonuses among other effects), and the jackpot on the gambling machine requires three Lucozade cans.[CR]The game was one of the earliest to feature product placement, particularly a brand with little impact on the game (instead of games about brands, or sports games with real teams), but not the first.[CR]In a reversed scenario, adverts for SuperFrog are also present in the earlier Team17 game Alien Breed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is similar to other platformers of the time, particularly Sonic and Mario, with large 2D levels, enemies, hidden areas, high speeds, and plenty of collectibles and pickups.[CR]The game is broken into six themed worlds of four levels each - forest, castle, circus, history, ice and space - which must be played in order (though level codes can be used to start at any particular level). Levels have time limits (explained as your superpower energy expiring, with small extensions by collecting Lucozade) and can't be exited until a certain number of coins are collected. At the end of each world, SuperFrog must fight the witch in a simple boss battle.[CR]Worlds and levels often include unique features or enemies. Water is occasionally present but (as the player is a frog) harmless and only causes a small slowdown - with the exception of water in the Ice Caverns, which is filled with frozen ice spikes, and some dripping boiling water in the Fun Land, which burns SuperFrog.Pickups & Collectibles[CR]All levels include a number of coins, fruit and gems, along with rarer high-scoring items and bottles of Lucozade. All add points to the player's score, with bonuses awarded for collecting large amounts of fruit/coins/Lucozade (items in hidden areas are included in these totals). Of these, only coins are required to be collected for the level's exit to open, but the number of coins on a level is always far more than the 'toll' required. An extra life is provided at every 200,000 points scored.[CR]SuperFrog starts with a number of lives (three by default, though options also allow 1 or 5), each with five health bars. Attacks from or contact with most enemies take off one piece of health, stun SuperFrog, and knock him out of the air if jumping, but also provide a short period of invulnerability to recover. Other environmental hazards such as spikes and fire will kill Superfrog immediately regardless of health or temporary invulnerability. Although some are immortal and must be avoided, SuperFrog can kill some enemies with the Destructo-Spud pickup or by jumping on them.[CR]There are also several pickups which affect SuperFrog directly:Pills, which are used immediately when picked upRestart Pills - SuperFrog spawns at the most recently-collected Restart Pill upon death (otherwise at the level start)Speedup/slowdown pills - change the speed that SuperFrog moves for a short time, and usually placed in helpful rather than dangerous placesInvisibility - SuperFrog becomes temporarily invisible (except for his eyes, to assist the player) and invulnerable to most enemiesAbilities, which last until SuperFrog dies or the level ends. Levels usually have duplicates of each; collecting extras adds score but doesn't increase the effect.Destructo-Spud - a short-range weapon that can be thrown at some enemies or objects to destroy them. It returns automatically after being thrown, can't be killed, and can be used repeatedly.Frog Wings - allow higher jumps, limited flight, and can be used to slow falls (although the game does not include fall damage, spikes and other dangers are often hidden in pits).Frog Dolls, which award an extra life immediately.Completed Level MinigameEnd of level slot machine.[CR]At the end of each level the player is awarded credits based on the time remaining, amount of fruit collected and the number of coins collected. These can be convertered directly to points to increase the player's score, or used in a slot machine for potentially bigger or better rewards. Prizes range from 10,000-75,000 point bonuses, extra lives, or a code to skip to the just-completed level (the only way to acquire them in-game). The slot machine is fairly complex, with several ways to win - gambling winnings for higher rewards, a simpler \"Hi-Lo\" feature, or getting three Lucozade cans which awards the Jackpot prize of points, credits and the level code.Platform-exclusive Features[CR]The Amiga versions include a bonus level between worlds 5 and 6 (i.e. approaching the Space Station), based upon the previous Team17 game Project X, named 'Project F'. The game plays like a basic side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, with the original spaceship replaced with SuperFrog in a space helmet.[CR]The PC game is the only version that includes gambling after completing the final level, including a prize of a (non-functional) level code.Other FeaturesEnd of Game Rankings[CR]Superfrog included a rating system that awarded the player a title when they finished the game, with the rank determined by overall score (and level scores determined by time, pickups, and luck/skill at the gambling machine).Mr PloppyFrog SpawnTadpole Grade 3Tadpole Grade 2Tadpole Grade 1Rookie Frog Grade 3Rookie Frog Grade 2Rookie Frog Grade 1Frog with a PurposeFrog with a MissionChuffed FrogFrog VeteranMean Green MachineSuper Frog Grade 3Super Frog Grade 2Super Frog Grade 1Frog God[CR]The game allowed high scores to be saved to a disk for 'a permanent record of your achievement', although it recommended against using the disks that SuperFrog was played from for obvious reasons.[CR]",

Suspicious Cargo is a text adventure with a graphical user interface. It is not necessary to type in commands into the text field; the commands can be constructed by clicking on the symbols of the user interface. When talking to other people, the topic can be chosen from a list. The symbol bars can be hidden in order to play the game as pure text adventure - the only bar which is always shown is the systems bar. It offers the possibility to open up a full-screen picture to illustrate some situations and a map which is used to quickly travel inside the space ship. The challenges faced in the game mostly deal with obstacles the hero faces on his way to Earth, e.g, sabotage acts by competing companies. There are also some action sequences like opening a lock or landing on a moon spliced into the story, but those are completely optional.",

An expansion pack,  Syndicate: American Revolt (1993) and a sequel,  Syndicate Wars (1996), have also been released. On February 22, 2012 a  remake was released by  EA Partners and developed by  Starbreeze Studios.[CR]Backstory[CR]As the world of today slipped into the future, multinational corporations grew in size and profit. They came into positions to own small countries and to exercise direct influence over the world's governments. They practically became the world's governments, undemocratically controlling the lives of people through commerce. These corporations became known as Megacorps.[CR]One of the Megacorps, a European one, invented the CHIP. A device that is inserted into the neck and stimulates the brain stem to alter a persons perception of the outside world. The CHIP numbs a person's senses to the misery and squalor around them better than any drug and sold millions around the world. It could convince a user that the sun shone when it was raining and that they were more beautiful than they really were.[CR]The CHIP, like some  drugs, also made the user open to  auto-suggestion, allowing them to be manipulated by the Megacorps. The CHIP became a perfect tool for the Megacorps to manipulating the populace and to gain power with. It didn't take long before the Megacorps were corrupted and became crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over the world.[CR]And in the year of 2096, the Syndicates have not only upgraded the drug they push, but also the way they fight. Instead of using ordinary thugs, they now use teams of custom-built  cyborg  agents to do their dirty deeds.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role of a young executive in a small European Syndicate. The objective of the game is to spread the Syndicate's control globally.World view screen[CR]The world is divided up into 50 territories. To gain control over a territory, the player must complete a mission in that territory. Missions objectives include the assassination of an important person, the elimination of rival agents or kidnapping. Once a territory has been gained, the player can start to collect taxes within it. The taxed amount can be adjusted, but if raised too high, the population can become rebellious against the Syndicate.[CR]The player selects a mission from the World map and can then select and outfit agents with weapons and  cybernetic modifications. Between missions, the player can also research new weapons and modifications. This is necessary if the player is to achieve the ultimate goal of world domination.During a mission[CR]In the missions the player controls up to four agents from a fixed isometric view. This is to reflect the fact that the player's character is sitting in an airship high above the city map. The player tells the CHIP controlled agents where to move and where to fire. They will not react to any event unless the player activates Panic mode. During missions, the player can kill  civilians and destroy many things without consequence.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR] Pistol: Very cheap, but basically worthless. Medium range. Shotgun: Short effective range, but does more damage than the hand gun. Uzi SMG: Fast rate of fire, medium range and comes with plenty of ammunition.Long Range Rifle: Very long range and extremely accurate.Flame Thrower: Devastating, but with a very short range.Mini Gun: Gatling gun with a devastating rate of fire and an incredible range. Laser Gun: Will cut through anyone or anything that gets in it way.Gauss Gun: Portable rocket launcher. Hell yeah.[CR]Special Equipment[CR]Persuadertron: A short range weapon that fires a small dose of chemicals, which will make the target lose all their free will and follow the agent who fired.Access Card: Plastic card that allows some security doors to restricted areas to be opened. Will also identify the agent carrying it as a Police officer to other Police units.Scanner: Scans for possible threats and items in the area.Time Bomb: High powered explosive that will, after a set time period, blow with devastating force.MediKit: Will restore a single agent\u2019s health completely.Energy Shield: Will, during a very short time span, completely protect the agent against all projectile weapons.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based that was developed by Konami and published in North America under their Ultra Games label in 1989. Based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license and taking cues from the 1987 animated series, it is a single-player game in which the player can switch freely between the four turtles at will.[CR]The box art to the game is taken from a reprint of Eastman & Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #4 Vol. 1, which depicts all four turtles wearing red headbands. The original comics were in black and white so there was little reason to give each turtle differing colors. The full cover has Donatello swinging his Bo at an alien named the Utrom, which was used as the basis for Krang in the classic cartoon. The image was cropped so consumers who were more familiar with the cartoon would not get confused from it.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game's story begins with Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady having kidnapped April O'Neil. The initial motivation for the turtles is to come to her rescue, but as the game proceeds, the turtles must foil further plans including the attempting destruction of a dam and the abduction of their master, Splinter. At the game's conclusion, once Shredder is defeated and the Technodrome is destroyed, Splinter inexplicably returns to his human form without explanation, and the turtles celebrate with a pizza party.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is divided into two primary modes of gameplay. When in exterior locations, the action is seen from a high top-down overhead view. The area can be freely explored to locate entrances to buildings and sewers while fighting off or avoiding enemies. The player will eventually be able also drive the Turtle Van and use its weaponry to clear some obstacles.[CR]When inside buildings or underground, the action switches to a side-scrolling perspective with platforms and obstacles that need to be jumped on or over. The player is able to jump, duck, or attack using either the selected turtle's primary weapon or a subweapon found during exploration. Boss fights are also encountered in this perspective. Once the player has completed he primary objective of a stage, the game moves on to the next.[CR]The player can freely switch between control of any of the four turtles at any time. Each has his own health gauge, and upon running out of health is captured. Players can restore the active turtle's health by collecting pizza in the environment. If a turtle runs out of health, he is captured and must be rescued by finding him in the environment, though captured turtles are not able to be rescued until stage three. If all four turtles are captured, a game over occurs.[CR]Each turtle can attack in four directions using their signature weapons, including up and down. Donatello's attack range with his bo staff is longest, and he also swings around to hit in the opposite direction. Leonardo uses his katanas, which provide the second-largest attack range, followed by Michelangelo's nunchuks and Raphael's sais.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game is divided into five stages:Rescuing April from Rocksteady and Bebop.Disarming bombs placed at the dam.Using the Turtle Van to reach the center of a city.Infiltrating a Foot Clan base to acquire the Turtle Blimp.Locating and infiltrating the Technodrome.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Of the game's non-boss enemies, only the mouser and the Foot Clan soldier appeared in previous TMNT media. The rest of the game's standard enemies were created for the game.[CR]",

                "plot": "A flight simulator that takes place during WWII. It captures the real dag-a-dag flavour of WWII dogfighting! Be a pilot of authentic airplane or take up the role as a gunner.Their Finest Hour : Battle of Britain was developed by Lawrence Holland for LucasArts in 1989.   George Lucas had been a fan of World War 2 movies since childhood, and the famous dogfight   scenes in Star Wars were directly inspired by these films... even down to the gun turret in the   Millenium Falcon... based on the B-17 Flying Fortress.  Based on the Battle of Britain during 1940, it gives you the chance to fly as a pilot of the RAF   defending England or in the Luftwaffe as part of the preparations for invading England.  The action is really intens. Chunks of aircraft fall off as you hit them, you can see the flashes of strikes on the fuselages   and wings - aircrew will jump for their lives using their parachutes while others aren't so lucky as their aircraft exploded in a ball of flame around them, while others   suffer a slower longer fate as the aircraft spun down out of control in flames. The game also allows you to create several personalities and have them fly with you on   combat missions. The best way to do this was go through all the single missions to give the   pilot/crew combat experience flying them yourself, then let them fly in your squadron during   a campaign - and if luck was with them, they will score kills, get promotions and medals.   You also have the ability to save your kills on a gun camera, and the game also includes a   mission builder, which is simple to use, but the missions you can create are far beyond   anything you may get in the game generated campaign.  You can never be killed by enemy fire in this sim, even if your aircraft were being blown to   pieces - the only way for you to die is to physically crash into the ground or sea. Also,   your parachute is fail safe and always opens, no matter how high or low you are!    Another funny thing, when your aircraft goes out of control through too much battle damage,   you will always spin to the right. You can do belly landings, both on land and sea, which is useful. The combat damage to your aircraft is inflicted on either the airframe or the   engine(s). The engines are very slow in throttle response - they measured from 0 to 100   percent power, and you have to tap the key for each percent you want to go up or down,   there is no snap commands to full or idle power!     \"    The aircraft available are :  Spitfire MkI Spitfire MkII Hurricane Mk1 Me-109E-4 Me-109E-4B Me-110C-4 Me-110C-4B Ju-87B-1 Ju-87B-2 He-111 Ju-88A1 Do-17Z.

In order to do so, they have to purchase new rides, restaurants and other amenities as well as hiring park staff and keeping abreast of concerns like litter, bored people waiting in lines and squeezing the maximum amount of profit from their parks.[CR]Theme Park made its debut on the PC (via MS-DOS) and Amiga home computers. It would eventually be ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Atari Jaguar and CD-based systems like the Amiga CD32, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and 3DO. The MS-DOS CD version featured Full Motion Videos of some of the rides.[CR]The game was also remade for the Nintendo DS in 2009 by EA Japan and on iOS around the same time. The PlayStation version was later rereleased on the PlayStation Network. Theme Park was followed by two sequels: Sim Theme Park/Theme Park World and Theme Park Inc/SimCoaster.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World map screen showing different plots of land available for purchase.[CR]Like most management games, Theme Park starts the player off with a plot of land that they have to develop. The player can build many things found commonly at an amusement park, such as roller coasters and Ferris wheels, all of which can attract more customers. Players are able to set prices, hire new staff and generally maintain the plot. The aim of the game is to make the theme park as valuable as possible so that it can be sold and a new plot can be bought somewhere else in the world. The player then starts to make a new theme park and the process is repeated.[CR]",

Up to 8 players can take it in turns, and there are 3 skill levels and a high score table.[CR]The tables vary in their complexity and difficulty; Thomas' is very basic in its design, while the others (especially Toby's) have more advanced ramps and combos.

The basic storyline involves a love affair between Anne of Austria, bride of the French king Louis XIII, and the Duke of Buckingham. Cardinal Richelieu wants to get her out of the way to ensure his own influence on the king. An opportunity arises when Anna sends a diamond necklace to the Duke as a token of love - exactly the necklace she is supposed to war for an important ball... Now the three musketeers Athos, Portos and Aramis - accompanied by the newcomer D'Artagnan - need to get it back in time. The player takes the role of D'Artagnan.The game plays mostly like a choose-your-own adventure game: the player reads verbose, written texts which are accompanied with static pictures. When it is decision time, the player gets presented with a few choices from which he needs to choose one, sometimes under time pressure. Only the correct choice proceeds the game. Sometimes the player needs to choose in which of the four cardinal directions he wants to walk, e.g. in a maze section.",

Levels may have you going through grocery stores and hospitals causing havoc, working in a restaurants, or retrieving a violin to play curly pop goes the weasel.

Gylend then turned five of the troopers into red gleaming energy balls and threw them into the endless void of time.[CR]Only Yohan and Ben were spared by the evil overlord, who told them that they would be given a chance to rescue their comrades. Should they be able to locate them in the different time zones and rescue them, they would also be given the opportunity to fight Gylend for the ownership of Earth![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Time Soldiers can be played in single player or in two player mode. The player starts the game with three lives. Anytime they are hit by a enemy or one of the projectiles they lose a life. After they have lost all three lives they can gain up to two continues by pressing the primary fire two times before the game over screen appears. It is a little odd why there are no normal continues in the game because this \"secret\" can be found in the manual, but this is probably how Time Soldiers rolls. The player can continue the game exactly where they died, but they lose all of the equipment they had. An advantage of the 2 player mode is that the player who died will automatically revive as long as the other one is still alive.Stages[CR]To rescue all of the five missing troopers the player must pass through five different time zones. Four of them are set in the past and one of them is in the future. Interestingly, the player does not begin the game in the same era every time they play. It is always one of the earlier zones, though. And, as might be expected, they will never start the game in Gylend's stage...[CR]Each of the time zones is divided into three stages. At the end of each stage the player has to battle a Mid Boss.[CR]After he is defeated a portal opens which will bring the player to a different time zone. When reaching the stage where their comrade is located, they also have to fight the so-called Big Boss. Defeat him and one of the comrades will be saved.[CR]The time zones and the corresponding enemies are:Brokeratops and Bitekan from the Primitive Era.Primitive Era:BrokeratopsCryptogramPurtasaurBitekanAruma (Middle Boss)Ankirosaurus (Middle Boss)Big Brokera (Middle Boss)Tyrasaurus (Big Boss)Ancient Rome:Bow ManPharantasRoman SwordsmanRoman GhostMedusa (Middle Boss)Anubis (Middle Boss)Tri-Neck Dragon (Middle Boss)Minotaur (Big Boss)Medieval Japan:Fire Throwing SoldierKappa (River Monster)NinjaPiper MonkSamurai (Middle Boss)Tengu (Middle Boss)Dark Monk (Middle Boss)Kabuki (Big Boss)The Large Tank from World War 2.World War 2Wild GeesePrivateMIL-29 (Middle Boss)Ratto Willis (Middle Boss)T-87 (Middle Boss)Hainder (Middle Boss)Large Tank (Big Boss)Future WorldDisco FighterSpark ShooterA-LineManrasu (Middle Boss)Nike (MIddle Boss)Gorugo (Big Boss)Gylend the Conqueror.Gylend's WorldRideruGerondo-DGylend (The Conqueror)Extras[CR]Some of the normal enemies the player defeats will also leave extras behind which can be picked up.

Their mission: to disarm nuclear bombs placed by a psychotic warlord.[CR]Timekeepers is hybrid strategy and puzzle game. It plays like a cross between Lemmings and a RTS like Dune 2. The main game screen has a row of icons at the bottom, timekeepers' portraits at each side and at the center a scrolling map of the level. The platoon is autonomous, the player can't control it directly but instead has to place icons on the map to order the troops. A soldier will try to perform an action while passing over an icon. The icons available are:[CR]Directions arrows - guide the trooper;[CR]Clock - stops the soldier for a while;[CR]Foot imprint - makes the timekeeper jump over something;[CR]Wrench - forces the trooper to operate some lever or switch;[CR]Gaping mouth - orders the soldier to attack;[CR]ZZZ - pauses the game;[CR]Brain - to choose earlier levels;[CR]Diskette - disk options, like saving and loading.[CR]There's no limit of time or amount of icons that can be placed. The levels have booby traps, enemies and dangerous environments that can kill your timekeepers. There are 60 levels on 4 different time settings, each with their own graphics set. The main objective of each level is to reach the exit and teleport all your troops to the next map.",

However, the player character is not defenseless: he can shoot little sparks at the enemies and he has four spells to his disposal. The latter are basically power-ups which can be activated at will: creating a temporary platform under his feet, floating, invulnerability and a smart bomb. All those spells are limited regarding the number of usages, but refills can be collected during the levels. A boss awaits shortly before each level exit.",

You control a girl in a rave outfit who jumps through a series of platform worlds where you throw some love around in the form of hearts, which somehow ties into an environmentally conscious (the packaging was made out of recycled paper) theme where the enemies are representatives of big business. Also, similar to Rainbow Islands, a mass of water is slowly rising from below, so you must hurry upwards through the level. The graphics make the game look not quite like anything else, as though the graphics artist just inverted all the tiles and put them in a random order.[CR]Keeping with the 90s sentiment of \"information wants to be free\", the samples and sprites are kept uncompressed on the disks, for everyone to edit according to their own tastes.",

Each event features 20 racers for the player to drive against. The game uses a password system, rather than saving progress.[CR]Career[CR]The game features a robust career mode featuring 16 territories with 4 tracks from each. After each race, players are given points that go towards that country's ladder ranking.

The war is against a country ruled by the evil General Ackboob, and he has closed his country off from the rest of the world.

The factory is actually manufacturing an army of mutants that could help Ackboob take over the world. The United States sends in only two soldiers, named Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, to stop Ackboob's evil plan. They are tasked in destroying hordes of mutant troops, rescuing hostages and defeating Genral Ackboob.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mutant bosses are big and ugly.[CR]Total Carnage is a bloody shooter that plays from a overhead perspective. One to two players can enter a game, and the goal is to shoot all enemies on screen. Each character can face all directions on the screen, and their only ability is to shoot. Different weapons can be collected that will give the players extra power. Each level will have them shooting through small enemies, and they will eventually meet a boss. Each boss is a large mutant monster that has a specific weak point to defeat them. There is the occasional mini game which will have the player pressing a button rapidly. One of the mini games has them attempting the execute General Ackhboob in an electric chair.[CR]Keys[CR]Upon collecting the first key, a message appears that upon collecting 220 keys, it grants the player to reach the Pleasure Dome which contains a huge score bonus.[CR]",

Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.[CR]Total Recall for the Amiga and Atari ST has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars.  The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels.  Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player can duck to avoid bullets, and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.[CR]Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed.  The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile \"boss\" vehicle to end the level.  Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.",

It was originally known as Ozaki Naomichi no Super Masters in Japan, but switched names (and celebrity pro-golfer endorser) when crossing to the US and Europe.[CR]Like a handful of golfing sims in the 16-bit era, the game projects a flat 3D plane of the course that the player can use to determine the direction of their next shot. The game has three courses for the player to choose from: a Japanese course, a USA course and a UK course.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf lets the player pick from two game modes: Tournament, and Practice.[CR]Tournament mode is comprised of 12 rounds of golf, each containing 18 unique holes. The player may select from three courses/locations: United States, Great Britain, and Japan. By progressing through Tournament mode, the player will develop better skills, allowing him or her to hit the ball harder and with greater precision, and also provides the player the use of new, better golf clubs. While the game possesses no save option, it does provide a code that can be used in order to start over at a particular round.[CR]Practice mode gives players a chance to hone their golf skills and allows them access to all skill levels and golf clubs.[CR]In play, the golfer's caddy provides useful information based on the player's skill level. At the lowest levels, the caddy will only be able to show the distance from the ball to the tee. However, as the player progresses through the rounds, the caddy can give more situational advice.[CR]The game utilizes a traditional control scheme, requiring the player to stop a moving meter at given points in order to determine height and strength of a shot. Upon reaching the green, the view switches to a closeup of the ball's position, and provides the player with a simple map of the green for easier shot making.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Treasures of the Savage frontier is the sequel to Gateway to the Savage Frontier, the first part of what was to be a series of adventures set in the Savage Frontier of the Forgotten Realms.[CR]It is part of SSI's Gold Box series of games based on TSR's Advanced Dungeons and Dragons ruleset and set in the Forgotten Realms. It continues to the use the Gold Box Engine first pioneered with Pool of Radiance and then enhanced for use in this series with Gateway to the Savage Frontier. Because it is based on the same engine behind SSI's Gold Box series of RPGs. only the setting has changed.[CR]The most important change to the Gold Box engine with this game was the Wilderness map (a change initially instituted in Gateway to the Savage Frontier). By traveling outside of a civilized area, such as a city, a map would be displayed allowing the player to move party around on it. Random encounters were calculated by the game in this mode as they would be in the normal Adventuring mode.[CR]The game, based as it is on the Gold Box engine, continues to use the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. As with nearly every Gold Box game, party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.[CR]When combat would start, a tactical turn-based system was used to display the battlefield viewed from an isometric perspective. Every member of the party including each monster were shown as individual icons that had a limited number of moves onscreen. The player was challenged to maneuver their party on the map, take cover behind obstacles such as wells, or even block doorways and act as tanks in order to protect their spellcasters.[CR]As this game was developed some time after the previous Gold Box titles were, it had also followed their lead in terms of its of copy protection by eschewing the cumbersome translation wheel that had been initially used.[CR]Upon starting, a verification question is shown which directed the player to find the indicated word answer in either the rule book (the manual) or the included Adventurer's Journal. The disks themselves did not have any copy protection allowing players to make copies and play on them instead.[CR]As with the previous games, there was an extensive amount of documentation included with the package:A basic manual with setup instructions and an outline of the rulesAn Adventurer's Journal going into detail on the races, classes, and the magic system of the game; it would also double as an additional layer of copy protection as it contained the scene description references for the gameA Quick Reference card for commands[CR]If players had gone through Gateway to the Savage Frontier, the option to import their characters from that game was available.[CR]Of particular note in the game is the use of romance. At one point, the main character of the party (the designated leader, or \"active\" character), can fall in love with one of two NPCs depending on their gender with considerable repercussions depending on certain factors such as whether the NPC was a part of the party or not.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story takes place soon after the events of Gateway to the Savage Frontier right on the heels of the party's victory over Zhentarim forces at the ancient ruins of Ascore. The Zhentarim forces in the region held a meeting with their allies: the Kraken Society, the mages of the Hosttower of the Arcane, and the pirate captains of the grim port city of Luskan.[CR]Zhentil Keep, a city of dark evil on the shores of the Moonsea, sees the great trading city of Waterdeep as a rival for power, and has planned its demise by first striking at it here through its Zhentarim agents. Their new plan would involve agents that would feed false information to the cities of the Savage Frontier, sowing distrust and convincing them that Waterdeep was planning to conquer them.[CR]Many of these cities belonged to the Lords' Alliance, a trading union of mutual defense of which Waterdeep was the leader. By plying this fiction into the ears of each city's leaders that Waterdeep was taking advantage of its position to ultimately ruin and conquer them, Zhentil Keep hoped that the infighting would do the job for them instead, allowing their own forces to take the region by surprise with little effort. It was a bold plan, but it had one fatal weakness.[CR]Zhentil Keep's allies had little trust of each other. Therefore, it was decided that the means to ensure their unity would lie in the use of colored crystals specific to each faction. These would enable their emissaries to read the coded messages pertaining to the missions they were to undertake, but only when all of the crystals were present. Each crystal would only decode a third of the message requiring all associated members to be present so that they would know each others' moves.[CR]The mission statements themselves were printed on \"Lucky Papers\", sheets with the name of the local city and written with the promise of good luck to the next person it was passed to. By hiding such information in \"plain sight\", it was thought to be the perfect cover in keeping their secret network intact.[CR]As for the Heroes of Ascore, the party from the previous adventure, they return to Llorkh which is now the last bastion for Zhentarim forces in the region. Amanitas, the mage that the they had befriended in the last adventure, asks for their help in freeing the city from Zhentarim control. There, they help the dwarves overthrow the Zhentarim governor that had usurped the city from their control and eventually defeat him and his forces. Their work done, they head to Secomber to meet with Amanitas.[CR]Unfortunately for them, the path to Secomber is filled with a variety of dangers. In Loudwater, the party encounters undead and deal with their threat, allowing the citizens to return to those areas that had been previously infested. At Secomber, they meet with Amanitas who gives them the Crown of Amanitas allowing them to communicate with him whenever they so choose. It is also where Amanitas gives them their first mission to guard ambassadors traveling from Neverwinter and Mirabar to Waterdeep. He gives them a letter for the meeting and they soon leave. They also encounter the first of the Lucky Paper crystals that they will need to stop the Zhentarim plot.[CR]At Leilon, the party is drugged at a tavern where they are welcomed and fed food from a great feast set up to celebrate some event. Little do they know is that the ambassadors that they were to meet have already been kidnapped by the Kraken Society and that the food is actually drugged. They awaken in a barn where they quickly make their escape, not knowing that this is actually part of a greater plan.[CR]At Waterdeep, the party arrive and are quickly placed under guard to face the head of security for the part of the city that they are in, although the truth is that the man is a part of the Krakens. He accuses the party of spying for the city of Luskan and the letter that they had been given by Amanitas revealed as a plot to conquer the Savage Frontier. The party quickly deduce that the real letter was actually swapped out when they were unconscious in Leilon and that they have been framed.[CR]They are thrown into the water to be drowned, but quickly escape thanks to the help of several sea elves that witness the events. Eventually, they make their way back into the caverns beneath the city and destroy a secret Zhentil base that is there, recovering more of the Lucky Papers.[CR]Throughout the adventure, the party visit each city in the Lords' Alliance and eventually recover enough proof to expose the Zhentarim plot and clear Waterdeep of any wrongdoing. But in the course of their adventures, they have also uncovered that Hellgate Keep, a city ruled by the undead far to the East, also has its own goals within the Savage Frontier.[CR]Hellgate Keep are after a powerful, magical gem hidden in the lair of an ancient dragon far in the mountains. But the dwarves also want the gem to protect it. The party is drawn into this conflict at the end of exposing the Zhentarim plot and, with the help of the dwarven adventurers, succeed in recovering the relic and defeating the forces of Hellgate Keep, becoming great heroes once more.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Treasures of the Savage Frontier is the second game in the Savage Frontier series. The same Gold Box engine that was created for Pool of Radiance continues to see use with few changes outside of an entirely different campaign than that of its predecessor.[CR]Imported characters from Gateway to the Savage Frontier brought across their statistics and most of their equipment, although was not necessary to play the game. A default party was available along with the option to create an entirely new band of heroes.[CR]A vault is provided in the cities of Yartar, Silverymoon, and Neverwinter for the players to store extra equipment. A special \"card\" that allows them to deposit items remotely to any of these vaults, an item that imported characters may carry over from the previous game as an earned quest reward.[CR]All of the gameplay mechanics are based on the 2nd edition of the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, otherwise known as AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) from TSR.Races[CR]Six races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world. This is a standard set provided across all of the Gold Box titles as well as titles such as Hillsfar.[CR]Players can also select what kind of sex their character is which has no effect on their abilities, only in their appearance for the character portrait.[CR]The races did not undergo any significant changes and had been presented in the same way as before in Pool of Radiance:Dwarves: Excellent warriors and often considered the best blacksmiths within the Forgotten Realms, they also harbor a strong hate for giants and their diminutive nature allows them to dodge their attacks much easier. They are also a hardy race and able to resist the effects of magic and poison.Elves: Long lived and resistant to sleep and charm spells, elves are often considered among the best spellcasters in the Realms although they are also skilled with a sword. They cannot be resurrected, however, but they can multi-class in many more different combinations than others.Half-elves: These share the hardiness of their human half along with the sleep and charm resistances of their elven parent, but not their long lives. And like their elven parents, are capable of noticing things out of the ordinary.Gnomes: These are treated as shorter and slimmer versions of dwarves in the game, although they tend to be a little better as thieves.Halflings: Resistant to magic and poison, they are about half the size of humans and can make decent fighters and thieves.Human: The most common race in the Forgotten Realms, they are average in most respects but have no major weaknesses, either. Capable of dual classing.Attributes[CR]Each character has a set of basic attributes that affect various abilities, such as combat prowess and how many spells a magic user can memorize before they must rest and re-acquire their spells once again. During character creation, the player may re-roll as many times as they want. Prime requisite attributes are those that are a requirement for certain classes. For example, Fighters must have a good Strength score in order to be effective.[CR]The natural maximum for any attribute is an 18, although it can go higher depending on factors such as race and magical effects. Throughout the game, unless it is due to an outside intervention such as a spell or a piece of equipment, these attributes never change even when a character levels.Strength (STR) - determines physical power and damage with weapons; also affects encumbrance in combatDexterity (DEX) - reflexes and the ability to remain hard to hit in combat; affects ranged weapons such as bows as well as a thief's abilitiesConstitution (CON) - a character's health is determined by this and hit points are derived from this score and a bonus calculated against it with every level. This also determines a character's chances for coming back to life with a resurrection spell, but in the process, a point of constitution is permanently lost.Charisma (CHA) - affects the perception that others have of a characterIntelligence (INT) - affects the ability to reason and think. This is an important score for magic users as it determines how many spells they can memorize and use per level.Wisdom (WIS) - this is important to clerics and determines how many spells they can store in memory and use[CR]Attributes, such as Strength and Dexterity, are also affected by the selection of race and certain bonuses and minuses are spread across them as a result. For examples, dwarves are inherently stronger than the other races and, thus, have a bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.Alignment[CR]AD&D's alignment system determines what a character's outlook is. Players can choose what alignment their character starts off with, although actions within the game can slowly shift it. Certain character classes are very much restricted to certain alignments.[CR]The alignment system remains unchanged from its previous implementation in Pool of Radiance:Lawful Good - Characters that are based on this alignment strictly interpret the rules and respect order above all else for the benefit of everyoneLawful Neutral - Moderation is far more important than the extreme, balancing their decisions between good and evilLawful Evil - The strong survive to enslave the weak, but one must rule in order to conquer and order must keep those that follow this character in line. An army is always stronger than a mob.Neutral Good - Some rules are needed along with the freedom to decide what is best depending on the situation at handTrue Neutral - Everything must be balanced; both good and evil have their place and neither must overcome the otherNeutral Evil - Law and chaos aren't as important as the results in bringing evil to the worldChaotic Good - Random actions and the freedom to implement them are more important than the rules in valuing life and ensuring the welfare of othersChaotic Neutral - Randomness and chaos are more preferable to being evil or goodChaotic Evil - This character will go to any lengths to grab power and influence, disregarding anything that may make sense or in cooperating with others to achieve their goals. Unpredictable and ruthless.Classes[CR]Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what classes a character may be restricted in playing as. The game allows dual and even triple classing among characters depending on certain options such as race.[CR]From the stock of basic classes, players can pick from certain combinations, although experience is divided among the classes that a character belongs to. As a result, they level much more slowly than a character dedicated to a single class.[CR]The basic classes are:Fighters - They can fight with any armor or weapons, but have no magical ability. When they reach 7th level, they can get an extra attack per round.Paladins - These are holy fighters whose faith gives them resistances to spells and poison. They can also turn undead creatures as a cleric can at two levels below their current level. They have an aura that repels evil much like a Protection from Evil spell. They also gain the ability to Cure Disease once a week and can heal themselves of two points of damage per day. They can also use cleric spells when they reach 9th level. However, they must be Lawful Good and have more attribute restrictions than a fighter does.Rangers - They are a fighter and can defend themselves without the need for armor and weapons if need be. They do bonus damage against giant-sized creatures and must be of good alignment.Thieves - They can disarm traps, undo locks, and help themselves to anything that isn't well protected. They can't wear any armor heavier than leather, but they can backstab in combat for critical damage.Clerics - Fighting priests that can wield a mace, but no edged or pointed weapons, as well as use armor. They pray for their spells and automatically memorize any of the spells available for a level when they reach it.Magic Users - Powerful spellcasters are always welcome in any party. They start out weak and remain physically fragile throughout their careers, but the powers they command at higher levels can rend parties of monsters apart in the blink of an eye. Nothing like a little human-sized artillery to bring onto a battlefield.[CR]Non-human characters can multi-class with a mix of these to enhance their abilities by sharing skills across them, although they level up at a slower rate because of the experience distribution across different disciplines.Locations[CR]There is no Overworld map in this game, but New Verdigris has a number of locations that the players will find useful as they explore the valley:Inns - These provide a safe place to rest although it will cost some coin.Shops - A variety of supplies such as armor, healing salves, and nearly anything else that the party may need can be purchased here. Inventory changes from time to time.Temple - Where healing and resurrections can take place if the party has enough coin to donate. Resurrections are particularly expensive.Bar - Visiting one of these allows the player to catch up on the latest news and gossip within an areaVault - The party can store extra equipment here as well as convert platinum coins into gems for the Well of Knowledge.[CR]Treasures of the Savage Frontier also features an extremely large number of cities to visit and side-locations to explore:Daggerford - Here is where the evil allies of Zhentil Keep plan to cut the supply lines to Waterdeep. Daggerford straddles the River Shining, a valuable trade route from the great city and by controlling it, they plan to lay siege to Waterdeep.Tower of Twilight - The home of a powerful mage who can train one magic user in the party for the price of 500 platinum pieces. But first, you have to clear all fo the nasty monsters around his home.Leilon - The party was supposed to meet with ambassadors here and escort them to Waterdeep, but are waylaid and captured instead. Escaping from their captors, the party must also find clues as to where the ambassadors were taken.Longsaddle - Various leaders within this ranching city have been corrupted by Zhentarim agents who plan to use it to breed monsters for use in their army.Triboar - Thanks to Zhentarim agents, the city believes that Yartar is planning to attack them and are building up their forces as a result. The party must uncover the true cause and stop the war before it even starts.Yartar - The Waterbaron of Yartar has been kidnapped and must be rescued. With this act, the Zhentarim hope to frame Triboar for the deed and encourage the city into attacking its neighbor in response.Loudwater - The city has an undead problem and the party can help clean up the streets allowing the citizens to return to the infested area...and reward them at the same time.Mintarn - This island city is under attack by ships bearing the flag of Waterdeep...but this is all a ruse by the Zhentarim to push the city into leaving the alliance. The city's leader is already convinced of this, and the party must work to reveal the truth before it is too late.Orlumbor - A great fleet of ships flying the Waterdhavian flag lie off its ports as a threat. The truth is that these are pirate ships, all a part of the Zhentarim plan to discredit Waterdeep, and the party must unmask these vessels.Neverwinter - The kidnapped ambassadors from Leilon are here somewhere in the city and the players must find them before they are arrested for the deed instead.Port Llast - The city is rife with intrigue and adventure and stopping here is sure to bring both into the party's lives.Trackless Sea Tours - Take a tour! See the Trackless Sea! And get attacked by pirates. Depending on what the party does here, their reputation may soar if they attempt to stave off the attack or suffer if they hide or run away, leaving the ship to its fate.Luskan - A rescue or two is called for here in the den of pirates who won't be too happy to see the heroes that have already ruined their plans elsewhere.Ruathym - This island nation is under the secret grip of the Zhentarim, something its leader wants to break himself free of but only the party can make that happen.Mirabar - This is where the Zhentish plot will come apart once the party has recovered enough of its pieces. It is one of the great cities of the Lords' Alliance and where a Council will determine the truth of whether Waterdeep is to blame for the recent troubles or if is caused by something else.Ice Peak - The final act plays out here, deep within the frozen lair of a mummified dragon clutching a mighty gem of incredible magic. The party will be forced to fight the undead and demonic forces of Hellgate Keep who are also after the gem, but dwarves are also there to seize it and help the party defend it against evil. But the gem itself has one card to play with its former owner before victory can be grasped.Wilderness[CR]One large change to the game is the implementation of a wilderness travel mode. In this mode, when the player leaves a city or other suitably civilized area, a large overland map is displayed and the player can guide their progress using it. Random encounters were generated and tactical combat ensued.[CR]Weather now plays a part in affecting the party's movement across the wilderness as well as in battle. Rain and snow can penalize characters' abilities making it difficult for those that rely on speed and dexterity to gain the upper hand.[CR]Combat[CR]The Gold Box RPGs had standardized themselves with a basic system that was shared across most of the party-based entries. The interface both for party management and information display were similar across titles such as this one making it easier for veterans to get into the game and creating a similar look.[CR]Fighting in the game continues to be handled through random and set encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. When combat begins, an isometric view (the combat map) is presented with every member and attacking monster shown as an icon.[CR]It is a turn based system with each side taking their turns to maneuver and issue commands. This tactical approach, in conjunction with the obstacles present onscreen such as walls and doorways, allowed the player to create their own strategies.[CR]Initiative played an important role in determining who goes first. Each round is divided into ten segments and every character and foe act on a specific segment determined by their initiative. Actions can be delayed and held until the end of round and the computer can fight for the player using the Quick command.Falling in Love[CR]Depending on several factors, an NPC may fall in love with a party member (normally the 'lead' character in the party). If the character is male, the NPC Siulajia may fall in love with him. If female, Jarbarkas may fall for them. While this may not has as much on an impact on the main story, it does have lasting effects on how well a particular character performs in battle.[CR]Certain actions in combat also determine the suitability of the character. By not participating as often in battle, they may not earn the respect of the NPC. By performing evil deeds such as cruelty to those they meet, this may destroy any chance of romance.[CR]This directly affects a character's ability to fight if they become involved with an NPC. Characters that are in love fight much stronger and more effectively when their paramour is in the same party. However, if the NPC is dropped from the party, that character's abilities also suffer to reflect their feeling of loss. This persists throughout the entire game.[CR]When romance is declared, the party must give their blessing to the couple to continue their journey together. If not, the NPC will leave and the abandoned character will suffer as a result for the rest of the game.[CR]Conversely, if the NPC is knocked out or killed in combat, the character that is in love with them with go into an uncontrollable, berserk rage for the rest of the fight.[CR]",

In each level of the game the objective is to collect all the flags which appear on the screen one at a time. Similar to Head-On there are chaser cars that are out after the player and it' necessary to avoid crashing into these. If that happens a life will be lost. To help the player it's possible to pick up fireballs that then can be launched and used to destroy the chasing cars.",

All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.[CR]Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.[CR]Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon:[CR]1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up;[CR]The laser, which can shoots beams as large as Turrican himself when maxed out;[CR] the multiple shot beam, which can shoot up to five beams covering approximately a 90 degree angle.[CR]The Turrican suit weaponry is not limited to the arm cannon however:[CR]1. He also can fire a continuous beam, activated by holding the fire button. This beam can be rotated around Turrican, so it is possible to blast things below him in this way;[CR]Additionally, he can fire power lines by pressing the space bar, resulting in two energy bars as high as the screen going from the Turrican suit to the left and right of the screen, severely damaging enemies in the process;[CR]If the space bar is pressed when the hero is crouching, the Turrican will morph into a shuriken shape. In this state, it will roll to the left or the right, damaging enemies while being invincible and small bombs can be dropped by pressing the fire button;[CR]Finally, the most powerful attack, which can only be used one time per life, can be delivered by pressing the fire button and the space bar at the same time. The Turrican suit will morph into a shuriken shape and fly around the screen for several seconds, while firing shots of the different weapons in multiple directions.",

It was eventually decided to organize a secret paramilitary group, dubbed Extraterrestrial Combat Unit (X-COM).

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar is the fourth entry in Richard Garriott's long-running and influential Ultima series of role playing games. Released in 1985 for the Apple II and then for the Commodore 64 and the IBM PC, Ultima IV departed from the \"kill the evil wizard\" plot of the earlier games of the series and encouraged the player to complete the Quest of the Avatar by mastering eight virtues and finding the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay in Ultima IV is not substantially different from Ultima III. However, Ultima IV introduces the concept of virtue as a foundation that governs the player's identity and progress. The player creates their protagonist at the start of the game by answering a series of questions about what he or she would do in a morally ambiguous situation. The player's answers determine which of the eight virtues he or she is most closely aligned to, and then the player begins the game with a character of the class which represents that virtue. The player's representative class and virtue also determine the city in which the player starts the game.[CR]There are eight virtues in the game, each represented by a class, a city, and a dungeon. The virtues themselves are built on the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. In each city, the player encounters a character of the class representative of the city's virtue, that under the right circumstances can join the player's party for a maximum total of eight party members.[CR]Inspiration for the eight virtues and three principles is found in a number of sources, including Buddhism and Hinduism, and as Richard Garriott himself said, the Wizard of Oz.The VirtuesVirtueFromCityDungeonClassHonestyTruthMoonglowDeceitMageCompassionLoveBritainDespiseBardValorCourageJhelomDestardFighterJusticeTruth and LoveYewWrongDruidSacrificeLove and CourageMinocCovetousTinkerHonorTruth and CourageTrinsicShamePaladinSpiritualityTruth, Love, and CourageSkara BraeHythlothRangerHumilityNoneNew MaginciaStygian AbyssShepherdConversations[CR]The conversation system is built on the foundation found in Ultima III, allowing the player to engage with NPCs with the key words \"name\", \"job\", and \"health\" and then by repeating phrases from the NPC's speech. In console versions of the game, text entry is replaced with a list of conversation topics that the player can choose from.Combat[CR]Combat is similar to Ultima III, but now spells require reageants which must be purchased (or found) and mixed in advance of combat. When the player enters a battle encounter, the player can choose to move party members individually one square per turn, cast magic, or attack from melee or long range (if the party members are appropriately equipped). There is also an \"Auto\" option that allows the computer to pick the action that the party member will take.Exploration[CR]While exploring the overworld, the player has access to the moongates; magical gates that were introduced in Ultima III. The availability of these gates are dependent on the phases of the two moons, which determine which gates are currently open and their destinations. However, unlike Ultima III, the game does not feature an \"underworld\" like Ambrosia.[CR]Dungeon exploration in Ultima IV continues to use first-person, 3D hallways, but now also features rooms depicted from an overhead view as well.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is tasked by Britannia's Lord British to become an Avatar by reaching enlightenment in each of the eight virtues. The player's standing in each of the virtues is determined by actions taken during gameplay. Positive influences include refraining from stealing (i.e.: Not opening treasure chests found in towns or castles), giving gold to beggars and blood (Hit Points) to healers, meditating, answering NPCs' questions properly, not fleeing from combat, and letting non-evil creatures encountered during combat flee.[CR]Once a player has reached the required level in a given virtue (the seer Hawkwind in Castle Britannia keeps the player appraised of his or her virtue) he or she must meditate at the shrine corresponding to the virtue. When the player has completed this task for all eight virtues, he or she is ready to take on the Abyss to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR]To accomplish this final task, the player must use eight colored stones (one found in each of the eight dungeons) to find the three parts of a key. Once the key is acquired, the player must then descend into the eight levels of the Abyss. Once the player has reached the bottom of the Abyss, he or she must answer a series of questions. If the player answers any of these questions incorrectly, the player character is warped back to the surface world and forced to navigate the Abyss again from the start. Should the player succeed and answer all of the questions correctly, he or she obtains the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the Avatar.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Ultima IV created the foundation of the rest of the Ultima series. All of the subsequent games would take place in or in relation to the world of Britannia and would reinterpret the virtues and the basic structure of the world. In later games, Richard Garriott would relativize the \"goody two-shoes\" story of Ultima IV by showing the unintended consequences of this single-minded quest for goodness. The antagonist of Ultima V would impose a totalitarian regime based on the virtues. It would be revealed that by taking the Codex from the bottom of the Abyss, the Avatar set into motion the destruction of the Gargoyles' world, and that by becoming the Avatar he or she spawned an evil alter-ego, the Guardian.[CR]The story of Ultima IV is extremely open-ended. The moongates allow the player to access any area of the game from the beginning, and the virtues and dungeons can be tackled in any order, except for the game-ending Abyss. The open-ended nature of the game would give way to a more tightly scripted story in later games.[CR]NES Version[CR]A version of Ultima IV entitled Ultima: Quest of the Avatar was made for the NES. The game's graphics were completely redrawn in a style similar to that of Japanese RPGs of the era such as the Dragon Quest series, and certain gameplay systems were streamlined for better playability on a console, rather than a PC with a keyboard. Otherwise, the game's structure and content are largely identical to the PC version. This version of the game was developed by Japanese company Infinity, which would go on to adapt the first two Populous games for Super Famicom and the Sharp X68000, and was published by Pony Canyon.[CR]Availability[CR]As of September 2011, Ultima IV is available at Good Old Games. It has also been released as part of the \"Ultima 4+5+6\" package.[CR]",

It's been 2 years in your world(20 in Britannia) and someone named Blackthorn has usurped the throne after Lord British has disappeared. LB has been spotted at marshes some times although Blackthorn has persecuted any who say so as sacreligious. While LB was ruling the Avatar's eight virtues were expounded and practiced to make Britannia more wealthy, but now there are high taxes and martial law and Blackthorn has twisted the eight laws to form a police state. He even wants to figure out the mantras and the secrets to the Codex and the now sealed-off dungeons. Your object is to rid Britannia of the menace he and possible accomplices pose to Britannia.[CR]Iolo and Shamino realize the kingdom is trouble and call on the Avatar of legend to come back. He does, but as he is summoned through the magic moongate three Shadowlords appear and one throws a bolt into Shamino, who is left on the edge of death. The three heroes retreat to Iolo's hut deep in the woods, where they hope to let Shamino recuperate.Title screen[CR]You'll need to get Lord British's artifacts, the Sandalwood Box, visit eight shrines and solve their quests (need to get the mantras too), get eight words of power to open the dungeon, and find Lord British. You begin as an avatar, but can lose the status by harming virtues. In the game this loss of Avatar status is shown by important clues being withheld. For example, in Britain, you won\u2019t receive the password for opening the dungeon Despise if you haven't followed the path of the Avatar. The game now also has day and night cycles. In the night, the gates to most towns are closed and the people living there mostly lay in their beds although guards still patrol.OverworldUnderworld[CR]One of the new improvements is the magic and combat system. In a combat situation you have a cursor which you can use to attack in any direction. That cursor will remain on the selected monster as long as you wish. That doesn\u2019t mean combat is easy since you only get 30 hit-points, more when a new character level has been achieved, while monster magic capabilities and sheer numbers have increased. Magical spells are now (and in further Ultimas too) divided into 8 cycles. The higher the level of the spell caster, the more magic they can use.Great graphics for that time[CR]Availability[CR]The game is available at gog.com and is part of the \"Ultima 4+5+6\" package.[CR]",

Ultima VI is notable for its single-scale world, in which cities blend seamlessly into the overworld, its strong moral sense, and its unstructured, non-linear gameplay -- a harbinger of what would later be called sandbox games.[CR]The Ultima VI engine would see use in the Worlds of Ultima series, which took place outside the main Ultima universe.[CR]Ultima VI was the final Ultima to see release on a wide variety of personal computer platforms, ranging from the C64 to the Atari ST, to the Amiga, FM Towns, PC98, X68K, and the PC, and years later on the SNES. Ultima VI was the first Ultima game not available on the Apple II.[CR][B]Background:[/B][CR]In Ultima VI, as in the previous two Ultima games, the player assumes the role of the Avatar, the embodiment of virtue and hope for the lands of Britannia. The game begins with the Avatar on Earth, enjoying a computer game, when a moongate suddenly appears. They enter through it, only to find themselves in the middle of a ritual sacrifice conducted by the winged, demonic-looking race known as Gargoyles. Although the Avatar is bound to the altar, and all appears lost, their companions -- Iolo. Shamino, and Dupre -- appear and free him. They then find themselves back in Lord British's castle, where they discover that the shrines of the virtues are under attack by the Gargoyles. The Avatar is tasked with freeing the shrines and discovering the nature of the Gargoyle invasion.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Similarly to other Ultimas, they are free to build their character, via stat points, in any way they wish. The Avatar is capable of using all weapons and spells in the game; however by increasing either STR, DEX, or INT, either melee, ranged, or magic attacks will be increased in effectiveness.[CR]Like other games in the series, the Avatar gathers a party to fight alongside them. They start off with three members, Iolo the Bard, Shamino the Ranger, and Dupre the Knight, but they can take any number of different characters with them, each of which have their own stats and uses. While the Avatar is the main character of the game, it is possible to take control over individual characters at times (which can have strategic uses), although the player cannot talk to other NPCs unless they are controlling the Avatar.[CR]As a sandbox-style game, Ultima VI lets the player do things different ways. There is not set order to completing objectives or visiting dungeons. There are a number of optional areas to visit and weapons to obtain. It is easy to miss things unless they explore every area. There is no level gating -- the player can explore the entire world from the get go. Ultima VI has a handful of travel options -- in addition to running, the Avatar can buy a horse, a boat, or ride a raft.[CR]The Avatar can rob stores, steal from the bank, and kill NPCS. They can kill a farmer's cow for meat, or milk it for milk to churn into butter. Take flour, and bake bread with it. Buy a ship and explore, or kill the shipwright and steal all his deeds. Ultima VI had a large number of what would now be called crafting opportunities, in which the player can take items gathered from the world and combine them to create something new.[CR]Although the player has a great deal of freedom, Ultima VI has, in the background and hidden from the player, something called Karma. Stealing or unprovoked killing decrease karma, while doing certain missions increases it. It is not possible to complete the game if the player's karma is too low.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameLocationSTRDEXINTMagicNotesBeh Lembefore Hythloth dunegon232426GargoyleBlainwith Gypsy band162118Gypsy jugglerGornunder Sutek's isleFighterGwennoMinoc1821179Bard, scholar and Iolo's wifeJaanaYewDruid and healerJuliaMinoc211817TinkererKatrinaNew Magincia191616ShepherdLeonnaMoonglow151518FighterLeodonMoonglow1519157FighterSeggallionSerpent's Hold282120Fighter.

It was developed by Impressions games and published by Sierra Online. The title was a more light hearted and less hardcore alternative to the championship manager series at the time although it did contain some extra features over its competitor that lead to it still being talked about today.[CR]Features [CR]Stadium DevelopmentStadium DevelopmentIt was possible in the game to totally redevelop your stadium as long as you had the cash to pay. It was also the only football management title to date in which your stadium, or more accurately a stand of your stadium could burn down, leading to reduced attendances until the stand could be redeveloped. Other stadium options included the ability to set the prices and type of confectionary sold at the stadium as well as setting ticket pricesBriberyBribery was also an option in the game. It was possible to attempt to bribe the referee into helping your team win a game thought this often led to you being caught and sacked so a save game before the bribery attempt was a must. TeleTextTeletextOne of the most distinct features of the game was the ingame use of teletext. Teletext was used by you the manager to check football results league tables and other footballing news. although it seems outdated now, at the time this was a quirky way of accessing information that mirrored real life as the internet was not as widely accessible as it is today.TransfersTransfers in Ultimate Soccer Manager were staggeringly easy. As long as you had the funds and the player was not in the league above you transfers were generally accepted. Transfers also happened immediatly and there was no ongoing negotiations like you see in modern football management titles.Match EngineMatch engineThe match engine was a simplistic top down match engine that enabled the player to see his matches and tactics being played out with the aim of spotting tactical errors. In reality the match engine was just a collection of pre defined routines but there was a sufficient amount of them to make it unnoticeable.[CR]Future[CR]Ultimate Soccer Manager has been rumored to be a future XBLA release although nothing has been mentioned since the initial rumor.[CR]",

Unreal is a magical world where you must save Princess Isolde, your true love, from the evil Polymorphic, the Master of Darkness.[CR]Unreal is made up of 8 levels and contains a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics.  The environment is also completely interactive - you can run up and down hills and slide through the snow but you have to be careful to not fall of the top of a cliff.[CR]On each level you will be faced with puzzles and battles and you need to get the high score you pass to the next level.  If your health reaches zero you will die and the game is over.  Fortunately, your health is replenished at the end of each level.",

The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack.[CR]After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it.[CR]The game also gives you a number of extra weapons that can be collected by either flying over pick-ups left from dead enemy wings or by catching them after the power generator has been destroyed.",

The goal of the game is to create a colony, build it up by collecting resources and creating new structures, raising armies to take down enemy forces (unique to each planet and each scenario) and reaching a sufficiently high quality of life to achieve \"Utopia\" status. At which point, the player has cleared the scenario and can move onto the next.[CR]The game is highly reminiscent of both Maxis's SimCity and Bullfrog's Populous. It borrows many of the former's elements in its construction elements, such as having a series of advisers to tell the player where they should focus, and borrows the latter's isometric viewpoint and GUI.[CR]The game was originally released on the Atari ST, Amiga and DOS in 1991. It later received a Super Nintendo port, which was published in the US by Jaleco, by Epic/Sony Records in Japan and by Konami in Europe. This port is one of a handful of Super Nintendo games to use the SNES Mouse. The computer versions received an expansion data disk named Utopia: The New Worlds, sold separately.[CR]",

The player uses the mouse to walk through the game's environments, or to interact with objects. While exploring the scenery, the player will often come across locked doors, which need to be opened by flipping a switch. There are two bars on either side of the screen. One bar is your stamina. If this bar is empty, the player will die and will be have to restart the level. The other bar indicates, if the player manages to pick up a flask, how much time they have until the flask is empty.",

Infinity had been born too late to be king.[CR]Set in the mystical castle of Valhalla, you encounter a horde of brain melting puzzles through four vast levels of dazzling graphics and exceptional gameplay in which the art of communication is the name of the game. [CR]Use the joystick button to bring up a series of icon that let you access a map of the level, or to look at, pick up, operate, or move objects. The disk icon that is among them allows you to save, load, or restart a game. Some of these icons are available when you choose to use an inventory object on something on the screen.

[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game picks up where the previous game ended. The story kicks off in a newly reunited England, more specifically castle Camelot. Some strangers manage to enter the castle and to turn king Constantine into stone and then steal Excalibur, the Holy Grail and sorceress Nineve. With Camelot's mystical treasures stolen, demons and monster roam the countryside. It is up to the Knights of the Round Table to end this stiuation and restore peace to the land.   The player controls a group of knights bound for Spain, where they hope to find the culprit.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is divided into seven episodes. The gameplay is a mix of RPG, Adventure and some basic strategy. The player can travel to many different towns, cities and castles. When traveling to different locations, you do so from an overhead map. When you enter a location the perspective switches to a 2D perspective with hand-drawn backgrounds.  The player controls a core-group of four knights, although different characters can temporarily join the group. The knights have different strange and weaknesses. The player is given an option to import characters from the previous game in the series, Spirit of Excalibur.   There are three different combat-styles which the player can choose for the knights. These are Reckless (offensive), normal, and cautious (defensive).   The game was originally released for MS-DOS in 1991, then later the Amiga and Atari ST.   [CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Amiga-version received mixed reviews from the press. Info gave the game credit for its non-derivative Arthurian-tale and nice looking graphics, while Amiga Power criticized the excessive disk-swapping and lack of support for the A500 Plus. [CR]",

For example the first world is sport themed so you will drive over football fields, billiard tables and racing courses.

The weapons covers the whole range from fast but not so powerful weapons to more powerful (but slow) like mortars. The action can be enjoyed by one or two players both turn-by-turn or simultaneous where one player controls movement and the other the weapons.",

Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.[CR]The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.[CR]Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.",

Much like their more successful franchise Lemmings, Walker has tiny characters with many intricate animations (Mostly attacking the Walker) Early in development a small tech demo of proto Lemmings walking and dying was created to demonstrate that the then designed 16 x 16 human opponents could be smaller and still animate clearly, this led to development of Lemmings which was released in 1991. Walker would only see release two years after that around the time of Lemmings 2 which included a cameo from the Walker as a trap for the Space Tribe.[CR]It was extremely difficult on anything other than the easiest difficulty setting where enemies would approach from angles.[CR]",

                "plot": "War In Middle Earth was a combination of real-time strategy and adventure game.  It followed the plotline of Tolkien's trilogy very faithfully, but at any time the player could turn off the set path and try their own way toward Mordor.  Searching in remote areas could turn up rare and valuable items, like the Staff of Annuminas, the Red Arrow, or a stray Palant\u00edr.  However, there was a major time constraint: eventually the forces of Mordor would march on Minas Tirith, and if the player hadn't mustered sufficient forces to defend it, the city would be completely overrun.  The game consisted of three views: the world map, which highlighted the location of all important characters; the overhead view,  where the player would issue command to units; and the zoomed view, which depicted the selected area and characters in side-view.  Combat orders were issued using a popup window that allowed the player to pick specific characters or troops and have them advance, fall back, or retreat.  Combat could be viewed in either the overhead or side views.  Items were found and collected using the side view. Each pixel of the world map constituted a distinct side-view screen; because hidden items could only be found on one screen, this meant the player would have to find the exact pixel on the world map where an item was located before they could collect it, which lead to considerable clicking and zooming.  The game could be won in two ways: either by moving Frodo (or whatever character held the One Ring, as Frodo could very easily be killed) to Mount Doom in Mordor, or by defeating the armies of Mordor then capturing the enemy's capitol Barad-d\u00fbr.  If an enemy  was able to kill the character holding the One Ring and subsequently return to Mordor, the game would end.[CR]",

Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens.Up to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination.  Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads.Each location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent).  When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours.Apparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.",

A special copy of the New American Desk Encyclopedia including Konami game advertisements was included with the game to help players make sense of the various clues, time periods, and locations throughout the game.[CR]The game was later ported to the SNES and the Sega Genesis by Hi Tech Expressions and Electronic Arts respectively.[CR]A television game show loosely based on the game also titled Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego? aired from 1996 to 1998 on PBS.[CR]When released, the NES version was awarded the following scores from Electronic Gaming Monthly: 5,7,5,6 saying, \"a very interesting and sometimes educational quest\".[CR]",

Throughout each level there are special \"Doors\" which are made of a specific material (Ice, Wood, Brick and Iron) these can be broken by a spin attack if the player has the \"Door Breaker\", which is effectively a \"key\" that is made up of the same material of the door. Only one key can be carried at a time so in later levels backtracking is necessary.[CR]Each time an enemy is killed it has a chance of dropping a Red or Blue Mushroom (Red heals, Blue poisons), certain enemies are indestructible, these are indicated by red and white markings.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wing Commander is a single-player flight game that popularized the space flight simulator genre and paved the way for games such as the X-Wing/TIE Fighter series. A war rages between the Terran Confederation and the cat-like alien Kilrathi. The player is a rookie pilot on the Terran capital ship the TCS Tiger's Claw. Cinematic intros and a sythesized orchestral score provide a space opera feel.[CR]The single player campaign consists of a branching story arc that begins with the player in control of a lightly powered patrol craft. Continued success will lead to the unlocking of better equipped vessels. Failure will lead to missions with overwhelming odds, possibly resulting in the destruction of the Tiger's Claw and the end of the campaign. Campaign progress is broken up by adventure game style breaks in the pilot's lounge. The player can communicate with wingmates and fellow pilots using text-based menus and the dialogue will reflect previous mission results. If the wingmate dies on a mission, their chair/locker/barstool will be unoccupied and their name crossed off on the killboard.[CR]Missions are launched from the briefing room, with a series of checkpoints to visit and objectives to accomplish. Mission types offer some variety between patrols, escort duty, attack runs and investigations. Missions frequently change from their original description en route as the player encounters enemy Kilrathi and is forced to make snap decisions to maintain the mission.[CR]The game used 2D sprites rendered out at various angles to simulate a 3D entity in a similar way that Doom would use later to represent its computer controlled enemies. Even this simulated 3D experience taxed computer systems of the time to their limits; when played on the standard Amiga home computer, the framerate would often dip well into single digits when space battles got frantic.[CR]",

Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull. These will downgrade your weapon or draw your energy level.[CR]After fighting the end boss of the castle, a three-headed dragon, you move onto a jungle, a swamp and further... That is, if you survive. Wings of Death has an unparalleled number of bullets and enemy objects on-screen for its time and platform, the maximum number being reported as 95. Coded by former demo programmers, the game also runs in full 50 or 60 Hz scrolling while playing digitised music even on an Atari ST, thanks to inventive hardware tricks used in few other commercial games.

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B]  [CR]   Wizardry VI is a first-person RPG that acts as the first chapter of the \"Savant Trilogy\". After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to find the Cosmic Forge, a quill pen said to be able to bend reality itself to whatever its author dares to write with it. It should not be confused with the Japanese version of the series which had long since spun off from the main franchise. It was published in October, 1992.  As in all other Wizardry games, Wizardry VI is played from a first person 3D perspective. However, it would be the first Wizardry to undergo an extreme overhaul in terms of its visuals. The 16-color EGA graphics and minimal sound effects make this game one of the less technologically advanced titles among the major RPGs releases of the early 1990s as well as the most technically advanced iteration of the series up to that point. Although the enemy sprites and animations are more advanced and detailed than the rest of the game's graphics, the in-game environments noticeably lack visual variety as a single tileset (grey stone walls) is used throughout the entire game. The various game environments are primarily distinguished from each other by (often quite verbose) text descriptions. Similarly, text messages and non-interactive dialogue sequences are used to advance the plot.The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. The original release of the game lacked mouse support but this was later added to subsequent versions.  Although it utilizes both elements of sci-fi and fantasy within its story, this is revealed only at the very end, an aspect of its gameplay that would see increasingly greater exposure in        Wizardry VII and the final installment with                       Wizardry 8, an element that the game manages to balance against the backdrop of an epic quest that easily crosses between both genres due to its vast scope. Because Wizardry VI represented a vastly updated engine and character development system compared to its previous five iterations, characters were unable to be imported from the older series. However, in keeping with its new storyline arc, characters could be later imported into Wizardry VII and from that, into Wizardry VIII. The game also featured a limited number of carry-over events depending on what the player decided to do, especially in concerning how the ending plays out.  Among the other features of the game were: Over 100 spells were available for casting14 classes to choose from11 races to create classes withOver 30 different skills to masterSkill point based upgrades to skills and statisticsVastly updated graphics engine and character development system[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   One of the changes compared to Wizardry I - V is the comparatively stronger focus on the game's story, and Wizardry VI marks the beginning of a new trilogy based around a mysterious antagonist known as the Dark Savant, who later returns in   Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant and  Wizardry VIII. While the ability to transfer characters from this game to later titles (in the case first to Wizardry VII and then from Wizardry VII to Wizardry VIII) was already a well-established feature of the series by the time of Wizardry VI's release, it further reinforces the continuity introduced by the new storyline. The story begins with the manual explaining the legend behind the Cosmic Forge. Nearly 120 years before the start of the game, a great castle was inhabited by a dreadful Lord and his Queen. It was said that they had conducted bizarre rituals at the heart of their home and that the King was obsessed over the mystic arts. He formed an alliance with another wizard whose evil matched his and together, the two sought to rule all of the evil planes of existence. They began a magical war and as they began to vanquish their enemies, they soon stumbled across knowledge of the Cosmic Forge.  A demonic arch-deity, brought low by their powers, listened to its pleas for mercy. In them, it told of a pen and its power to create events by merely writing them into existence. The King and his ally slew the demon regardless of the story (and not before they learned of its location) and took it for their own needs. They began to script things that no man should ever see, but shortly afterwards, jealously and suspicion grew in the hearts of these former friends. Eventually, both the King and the Wizard engaged in a terrible battle to decide the fate of the Cosmic Forge and that was the last that anyone had heard of them.     Enter the party. On learning of the legends surrounding the castle, they enter to challenge its dangers only to find themselves locked in. The vast castle, however, has allowed a number of inhabitants to live within its walls as if it were a small city. In the basement, a den of thieves along with pirates ply their trade. Beyond the castle itself in the mountains, giants and dwarves continue to work their mines. And it is there that they find the spirit of the Wizard, Xorphitus, the former ally of the King.  He tells them his story and reveals the truth behind the title of the game. Xorphitus wished to know everything that there was to know in the universe, but in doing so, the Cosmic Forge split him into two separate beings: the calm and seemingly benevolent spirit that greets them, and the madly violent physical form that appears before them later in the adventure. Xorphitus explains that the nature of man is divided and that to know all things was a breach of this natural law. As a result, he was split into two beings with both halves containing half of the universe's knowledge. This is the Bane of the Cosmic Forge. He explains that when the Forge is used outside of the Cosmic Circle, it would fulfill what was written but do so as a twisted and perverted form. While technically fulfilling what was written, the results will not be what the writer would ever expect.  Eventually, after many adventures, the party gain entrance to the River Styx which runs below the castle and discover the lost King, the Queen, and the King's lover, Rebecca. The King's Bane in using the Cosmic Forge was in becoming a bloodthirsty vampire when he had used it to give himself immortality. He can feel nothing and lacks any real emotions and upon seeing the party, attacks them and drains their blood. Afterwards, he leaves them weakened but alive.    The Queen is still present in the world but only as a spirit. She relates to them the story of how she was impregnated by a demon and gave birth to to the half-breed, Rebecca, whom the King then took as his lover and had the Queen killed. She wishes revenge and gives the party a silver cross to destroy both the King and Rebecca. But if the party later discovers that her story is false.  Rebecca had been left by a holy man and his betrothed, Annie, at the castle and the King took her in as his own. The relationship eventually developed into one of romance and the Queen, jealous for being tossed aside for Rebecca, used the Cosmic Forge to write in the death of who she considered the \"witch\". Unfortunately for her, the Cosmic Forge interpreted the \"witch\" as her, thus making it so that she would slip and fall on a knife as her Bane.  When the party finally meets Rebecca, she hypnotizes them and brings them to meet the King wherein lies one of the story branches of the game. If the party believes the Queen, the King burns himself on the cross but takes quick action to imprison the party. If the party does not, the King instead drinks his fill of blood and tosses them into prison regardless. But the choice at this point will carry over to the end of the game.  They also run into the physical form of Xorphitus and defeat him and then confront the King again. If the party had thrown away the cross, the King relates his story of a life without emotion to them and then finally ends his miserable existence with a holy stake to his own heart. Rebecca appears to the party later and then asks them to take care of the Cosmic Forge and to meet her half-brother, the dragon Bela, who was actually borne out of an affair between the Queen and the visiting Vicar.  If the party allies with the Queen, however, and still have the cross, they are forced to fight the King. After dying, he tells them of his struggles, and then disappears.    After dying, the Cosmic Forge is revealed and the party can decide whether or not they wish to take it. If they decide to secure the relic, a voice sounds out from nowhere as a cyborg named Aletheides appears. He takes the Cosmic Forge and the game ends after prompting the player to save.  If they do not take the Cosmic Forge and instead go on through past it, they find Bela. If they had believed the Queen and had killed the Queen (and, perhaps, Rebecca), he attacks the party out of revenge. If they did not, he is happy to see them and invites them to accompany him on a starship that he had constructed with the help of the Umpani, an alien race with which he has had contact with. If the party had killed Bela, they step into the craft and it takes off into the stars.  The way that the game ends will largely determine what happens to the party if veterans decide to import their characters into Wizardry VIII. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Wizardry VI is a tile or                      grid based movement, first-person RPG set on the world of Lost Guardia. The player must find the legendary relic, the Astral Dominae, before the Dark Savant does. But, in order to do, the party must also negotiate the many side quests and explore nearly every dungeon to find what they need as well as beat the other factions that also have their sights set on attaining the relic for their own needs.  Exploration of the dungeons and other locations in Wizardry VI proceedes in a fairly linear fashion. By solving puzzles and quests (which often involves locating the correct buttons to press, finding the appropriate key or tracking down a quest item demanded by one of the game's few friendly NPC) the player gains access to new areas which were previously off-limits. The lack of an automap (which had yet to become a standard feature of RPGs at the time of W6's release) means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on inofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeons of the game.  Saves could be made anywhere and at anytime in the game. Character InteractionUpon encountering neutral NPCs, the player could be introduced to their own story as to what they are up to leading to several pieces of valuable information. As for anything else that the player may want to know, they may have to work on getting them to trust them. The parser introduced and used for interaction would allow the player to phrase sentences similar to those used with    interactive fiction. When NPCs are softened up enough, they can share many tidbits such as who they are, what they are doing there, and perhaps what news they may have. A parser allows the player to communicate with them with simple phrases. This parser concept would be further refined in both     Wizardry VII and                    Wizardry VIII. PuzzlesWizardry VI had quite a few puzzles to get through, but was notable for its maze-like dungeons with many random encounters thrown in for good measure. Wizardry Gold included an in-game hint system that would help the player figure out all of these if they chose to use it.  Inventory The inventory system was handled primarily on a character-by-character basis. Encumbrance was also another important issue to consider as it could adversely affect the performance of a character. The weight limit was indicated on a character's profile and was color coded to indicate just how close they were to their limit. Even if the character hadn't reached it, simply coming that close to it would weigh them down and affect how well they could fight in combat, replenish their stamina, etc.. A character could carry more than their weight limit, but at an even greater risk to how worse they would perform in battle.ExploringMoving around the world was as easy as using the keyboard to move the party. The game was also filled with a variety of hot spots to interact with whether it was a lever or a locked chest that required a little lockpicking. Anything that wasn't nailed down could be added to the inventory of a character.    Picking Locks and Disarming Traps Thieves and others with the ability to pick locks will first need to set a series of tumblers in place. As they turn in the lock, the player has to wait for a green line to highlight that the lock is in the right position to be opened and hitting the ENTER key would unlock it. This was dependent on the character's skulduggery skill. Locked doors could also be forced open with an appropriately strong character or a mage with the Knock Knock spell. As for disarming traps, when one is suspected, the thief is presented with a jumbled word showing what kind of trap they believe it to be (depending on their skulduggery skill).  For example, a POISON NEEDLE trap might come across as EISOLP OENNDE. However, in much more difficult cases, several letters may actually be missing from the phrase. With a higher skulduggery skill, the better were the chances in seeing all of the letters and in determining the kind of trap it was. The letters were further color coded in order to give the player clues. Green letters are definitely part of the trap's name while red ones are questionable. Gaps presented the fact that there was more than one word in the name of the trap. Asterisks mean that a letter previously picked is not in the name of the trap. Once you are certain of the trap's name, an attempt can be made to disarm it.  At that point, a list of traps known to Wizardry will come up and the player must choose which one they believe it to be and press enter. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed.[CR]Character Development[CR]The player can opt to start with the batch of pre-made character provided for them by the game or create their own.  AgeCharacters can actually age in Wizardry VI if they rest too much. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, and eight hours pass for every time that this is uninterrupted. However, rest enough times, and a character will start to age. A symbol showing planets moving around hte sun represents this passage of time shown in the character's portrait screen. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.  RebirthsWizardry VI kept track of a character's resurrections. Every time a character is brought back from the dead, they lose a point of vitality which would ultimately impact their resistance to damage. A number kept track of which life they are currently on. Classes   The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are characterized by a few primary skills or abilities (such as Skulduggery and Ninjutsu for Thieves and various weapon skills for Fighters), whereas Elite classes (Lord, Samurai, Monk, Ninja, Alchemist, Psionic, Bishop, Bard) typically benefit from having significant proficiency in both weapon and magic skills (the specialized, magic-oriented classes Alchemist and Psionic are notable exceptions to this). The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.   As with quite a few RPGs, Wizardry VI includes the option to change character class during the course of the game. The incentives to do so in W6 are comparatively strong, as many skills and abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly). Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they also have the ability to go berserk and deal double damage while leaving themselves vulnerable to attack. A grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it. They also boast improved stamina regeneration so as to avoid getting too tired in combat.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fifth level of experience and can heal wounds over time without the need for magic.Valkyrie - Only for women, Valkyries are first rate warriors and experts with a lance allowing them to deal damage over a decent range. Also around fifth level, they start learning Priest spells. Occasionally, upon dying, they may even cheat death and return to life immediately afterwards.Ranger - An expert at ranged weapons and in sniffing out the hidden, these are decent fighters who also boast of the ability to kill enemies with one shot once they become expert enough in their field. At fifth level, they may even learn a few Alchemy tricks.Samurai - A true swordsman, their speed and accuracy give them multiple attacks in combat. They never succumb to fear, magic or otherwise, and have the ability to seek out the weakness of an enemy for a critical strike that can kill them in an instant.Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes sending a shuriken at an enemy and killing them in an instant. As they become more experienced, they also begin dabbling in Alchemy.Monk - A spiritual warrior, they fight best with little to no armor and with only their bare hands. Their martial arts skills allow them to critically hit opponents when the opportunity presents itself and their armor class is determined by their sheer will.Rogue - No party is complete without a thief who can pick locks and disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.Bard - A decent fighter, their true strength is in the magic of their music as it blesses the party with beneficial effects and their enemies with even worse ones. Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They can also dispel the undead.Alchemist - They use their knowledge to mix up potions and invent mixes on the fly. As a result, they are unaffected by troublesome silencing spells and learn the skills of their craft much faster than others.Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But with their uncurse ability, they're nigh indispensible.Psionic - Focused on the power of mind, they are the experts in illusion, fear, and in burning the brain of anyone that dares to challenge their power. They learn mental spells faster than anyone else.Mage - The classic wizard. Their long exposure to magic has given them some resistance to the same and their focused study ensures that as they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells.  RacesThe races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit but the game also features original ones such as the Felpurr (a strong and agile feline species well-suited as Samurais or a number of other Elite classes), the Dracon (part human, part dragon) and the Rawulf (wolf-like creatures who make excellent priests). These unique races return in both Wizardy VII and Wizardry VIII, with some modifications. Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Alchemists, Psionics, Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a PriestGnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or AlchemistsHobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Rogues.Faerie - Tiny and delicate, their magical nature, high intelligence, and fast reflexes make them tremendous Mages, Alchemists, or Psionics. However, it also isn't unusual to see a few as Ninja or Monks, either.Lizardman - Tough, reptilian, and not very smart, they often make tough FightersDracon - They resemble humanoid dragons and have a number of unique abilities such as being able to hurl a breath weapon at their enemies. They make excellent Fighters.Felpurr - Catlike humanoids that are both fast and nimble, their inherent abilities make them ideal for being Ninja or SamuraiRawulf - They are devout and hearty creatures resembling humanoid dogs. Their strong vitality, keen senses, and unwavering piety make them ideal Priests, Lords, or Valkyries.Mook - Magical creatures resembling hairy sasquatches with wise faces, their intelligence makes them formidable Psionics and fine RangersStatistics Attribute scores ranged from 0 - 100 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.   When an attribute hits 100, it bestows an additional bonus skill that can also be improved during the course the game, such as a skill that can improve a character's ability to empower their spells with additional strength making them even deadlier in battle.Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaIntelligence - Important for spellcasters and affects skills such as artifacts, mythology, music, and even a character's skill with picking locks and disarming traps. Ranged combat, close combat, and even engineering are also affected by intelligence as they are often derived from complex actions requiring a keen mind as well as a strong arm.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Dexterity - Being nimble and quick is an important attribute to have in combat as it can also determine how many attacks a character can make per round. The ability to dual wield without cutting off your own leg, picking locks, and disarming traps so as not to poison everyone in the party is also largely determined by this attribute.Speed - Initiative, the number of swings that a character can hurl at an enemy, and some combat skills. Being particularly quick can also affect armor class (defense).Senses - Awareness of everything around them; important for detecting monsters  Upon finishing the process, the player had several options to toy with. Portrait - Depending on the sex and race of your character, several animated portraits were available for the player to pick from. These would be visible from within the onscreen interface when they had something to say, or when something nasty would happen to them...such as death.Name - Characters actually had two names: their full, impressive sounding one, and the nickname which acts as the shorthand display for who they are in the interface.As with many RPGs, character development was driven by experience points which translated into levels. When a character gains a level: attribute points may increase (they can decrease as welladditional bonus points are earned for skill developmentSpellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points and stamina may improve Skills Wizardry VI's skill system allowed the player to customize each character's strengths depending on how they wanted them to develop. Skill points earned allowed the player to distribute them as they saw fit. There were also unique skills that belonged to specific classes and would have considerable bonuses to their starting condition because of that, but for the most part, it was up to the player to decide what they should specialize in. If the player wanted to invest points in another skill other than Dual Weapons for their Samurai, they were free to do so. Skills reached a maximum of 100 points and were divided into several groupings:  Weapons:  Weapon handling as defined by each skill also defined how well a character was able to use that skill to destroy their enemies while avoiding killing themselves in the process.Sword - determines a character's ability with, well, a swordAxe - chopping skill useful in combatPole and Staff - Determines a character's ability to hit and penetrate with a pole or a staff such as a halberd or a staffMace & Flail - Determines the character's ability to hit anything with a mace and flail type weaponWand & Dagger - Determines the character's ability to bash baddies with a staff or a daggerShield - Improves a character's shield handling abilityBow - Determines the character's ability to use a bow in combatThrowing - Affects a character's ability to throw objects.Sling - Affects the character's ability in using a sling to annoy bad monstersHands & Feet - Affects a character's ability to punch and kick their opponents into submission without looking like an idiot. Physical Skills:  These generally affect a character's ability to do things that require the talents of body or voice. For example, a character skilled in Scout will be able to detect a strange piece of straw in a haystack while another without the skill will walk on by without noticing the secret door that it unlocks.Skulduggery - The ability to successfully detect and disarm traps as well as pick through locks without getting a face full of death sprayed into itNinjutsu - A character's ability to conceal themselves in combat making them harder to hitMusic - The ability to play enchanted instruments and coax them into unleashing their powers upon unsuspecting enemiesLegerdemain - Determines how easy a character can give themselves a five fingered discount either in the store or from a random victim (i.e. NPC). Beware, a poor thief caught in the act will usually get a dose of street justice along with their friends.Scout - Largely used to detect hidden items and secret doors.Swimming - Affects a character's ability to not drown while crossing bodies of water.

When enemies encountered the party, or when negotiations broke down into armed conflict, this mode would start. Often, only a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were onscreen would appear with little information depending on how advanced any character's mythology skill may be.   Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their speed statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.  In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders. When several groups of monsters are encountered, the player is able to pick out who the targets are from the generated list shown onscreen. Enemies may also run away if they are hurt too badly. The \"Fight\" option, however, is only available to those groups of enemies that are within melee range. For other monsters that may be behind them, ranged attacks are required to hit.[CR]",

It splits its time between an Arcade mode which plays similarly to Breakout but with full control of the \"ball\", and an Adventure mode which relies on adventure game inventory puzzles.[CR]Wizkid, the son of Wiz from Wizball, is tasked with saving the nine kittens of Wiz's cat Nifla. He must pass through a series of abstract levels defeating enemies and finding the kittens before he can confront their kidnapper Zark.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizkid is split into two modes: Arcade and Adventure.Arcade[CR]In this mode, also known as \"Head mode\", Wizkid must use the floating blocks around him to take out enemies. This is possible by ramming Wizkid (currently just a disembodied head, like his predecessor in Wizball) into the blocks to dislodge them, using the direction and speed with which Wizkid hits the blocks to send them falling onto the enemies below. Doing so will reward Wizkid with colorful musical notes which will eventually fill a little music sheet at the top of the screen and allows him to enter the other mode: Adventure. If the player beats a stage without leaving Arcade mode, which eventually cycles around, they'll almost always end up skipping a stage and missing the true ending. If Wizkid fails to beat a screen by dropping all the blocks while there's still enemies left on the screen it'll get skipped and the player will eventually cycle back to it.[CR]In Arcade mode Wizkid can collect two power-ups: a clown's red nose, used to balance blocks until Wizkid's ready to send them at enemies; and a pair of false teeth, used to grip a block so Wizkid can directly maneuver it over an enemy.Adventure[CR]In Adventure mode, Wizkid reclaims his full body and is able to explore the level proper, finding secrets, using the store and collecting items to use elsewhere. Solutions to finding the kittens (the true goal) are often obtuse and sometimes requires a guide. If the player gets stuck in this mode, they can always return to Arcade and continue the game from there by holding down on the joystick and summoning the store interface.[CR]Finding all nine kittens from the nine worlds allows Wizkid to race Zark back to his tower in a rowboat and defeat him face-to-face - any fewer kittens and he'll beat Wizkid in the race and lock the front door. To beat Zark the player has to get the high score on his \"Wizeroids\" arcade machine (a parody of Asteroids).[CR]",

He wrote, \"...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing\".[CR]",

This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.[CR]The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games). Non-qualifying teams are marked with an asterisk (*). Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1997 exclusively for Amiga AGA systems (A1200 and A4000), Worms: The Director's Cut (also known as Worms: DC) is a heavily modified version of Andy Davidson's turn-based strategic artillery game Worms, which was first put forth by developer Team17 and publisher Ocean Software in 1995. Like its forebear, it is a two-dimensional game in which a player-controlled team of worms uses a large arsenal of weapons in order to attack and defeat other teams of worms controlled either by humans or A.I. Design and programming of The Director's Cut was largely attributed to Davidson himself, and the focus on AGA systems allowed for a broader depth of colors than the initial Amiga version (sixteen colors rather than eight) as well as nine-layer parallax. Davidson also reportedly pushed for a CD32 version as well in order to offer enhanced sound, though this version never materialized. In addition to cosmetic upgrades, The Director's Cut features a number of new gameplay features, including fifteen new weapons, cavern maps with enclosed ceilings, and a Graffiti mode where players can \"paint\" custom maps.[CR]Development[CR]According to creator Andy Davidson, the goal for Worms: The Director's Cut was not only to make it \"the best version of Worms available on any platform,\" but also \"the best Amiga game ever.\" Since a proper sequel to Worms, Worms 2, was being developed concurrently by a separate team, Davidson was given carte blanche to create his ideal version of the original Worms. Many of the ideas generated for The Director's Cut would later be incorporated into Worms 2, and Davidson himself referred to it as something of a testbed for the sequel, though Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown stated that the development teams for Worms 2 and The Director's Cut \"were quite separate\" and did not really have \"shared design goals.\" The Director's Cut would end up being one of the last Worms titles that Davidson would exert significant creative influence over before leaving Team17 in the late '90s; as Brown recounted in 2009, Davidson had \"quite a bit of input into the sequel, Worms 2, but much less so in Armageddon.\"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]See also: Worms[CR]The fundamental gameplay of Worms is not significantly overhauled with the release of The Director's Cut, however a number of new mechanics and weapons are introduced, many of which are carried forward into subsequent titles. In addition to the normal forward jump, for instance, worms are given the ability to perform a more vertical backwards hop. Certain weapons can now be placed while on a Ninja Rope or Bungee, and the Ninja Rope is further modified to allow for multiple swings without touching the ground (also known as Tarzaning). Cavern levels that severely restrict the effectiveness of certain weapon types are added into the mix with the normal \"Open\" levels, and a new Graffiti mode allows players the means to quickly create custom maps in-game. Fifteen new weapons are also added to the original complement, and many of them, including the Holy Hand Grenade and the Concrete Donkey, would go on to become staples of the series.[CR]New Weapons[CR]The Director's Cut includes nearly forty weapons and utilities in total, although more than half of these are carried over from the previous game. Only two previously-introduced weapons did not make the cut: the Prod of Worms and the Mole Bomb of Worms: Reinforcements. Most of the new weapons in The Director's Cut are considered \"super weapons,\" and as a result they must be collected from weapon crates rather than being immediately granted to the player. Three \"secret weapons\" are among the new additions also; these armaments do not show up on the weapon panel by default, and are more rare in crates than other super weapons.Grenade LauncherGrenade LauncherDamage: Up to 30 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (3x)Unlike most propelled or thrown weapons in Worms, the Grenade Launcher does not give the player control over the strength of its release. Instead, it is always launched at full strength in whatever direction it is pointed when fired. Its payload explodes as soon as it touches a solid object, releasing a cluster of bomb fragments that also explode upon touching the ground. It can be somewhat challenging to ensure that these bombs fall in a predictable way, so deploying it against groups of worms is often preferable to individual worms.HandgunHandgunDamage: 5 HP per bulletHotkey: F3 (3x)The only addition to the firearm category in The Director's Cut, the Handgun is also, without a doubt, the least powerful weapon in its class. When a worm takes aim with the Handgun and fires upon a target, three bullets are released, each capable of dealing five hit points of damage. With the absence of the Prod in Worms: DC, the Handgun is most likely intended to take its place as a humiliation weapon. Even the manual admits that it is \"not much use,\" suggesting it instead as a satisfying way of finishing off particularly troublesome worms.Petrol BombPetrol BombDamage: 15 HP per flameHotkey: F6 (2x)The Petrol Bomb is tossed just like a Grenade, and similarly is not affected by wind. From there, however, its similarities to other thrown weapons diminishes, as it explodes immediately upon impact with the ground and unleashes several gouts of flame that spread out horizontally from its impact point. These flames cause damage to any worm they come into contact with, which can be compounded depending on the level of exposure. It is perhaps most effective when used against multiple worms or worms in confined areas.Homing PigeonHoming PigeonDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: 6Essentially a Homing Missile with a brain (albeit a small one), the Homing Pigeon is mindful of its surroundings in a way that the Homing Missile is not. Once released, it will endeavor to seek out its preselected target while also avoiding terrain obstructions along the way. The bird's intelligence does have its limits, and furthermore it requires a small period to activate after being fired, so misfires are possible, but overall it is much easier to deploy successfully than a Homing Missile, and it causes a greater amount of damage as well.Mad CowsMad CowsDamage: Up to 75 HP per cowHotkey: 6 (2x)The first Worms weapon that can be released in herds, the Mad Cow armament consists of a number of ambulatory bovine bombs that explode with the power of Dynamite. Once unleashed, one or more Mad Cows will run forward and explode immediately upon encountering any obstruction. The exact number of Cows released by the player is adjustable, and depending on the player's current stock, between one and five can be sent out at once. Mad Cow weapon crates typically yield three, so a single crate can result in up to three uses.Holy Hand GrenadeHoly Hand GrenadeDamage: Up to 100 HPHotkey: 7Making the first of many appearances within the Worms franchise, the Holy Hand Grenade of The Director's Cut operates much like later iterations of the weapon, being thrown in the same manner as other Grenade-class weapons. Unlike its contemporaries, however, the Holy Hand Grenade (or HHG) is far more powerful, powerful enough to kill an uninjured worm, in fact. It does not possess a player-adjusted timer, but rather explodes three seconds after it comes to rest on the ground. Compared to other explosives, its radius is quite large.Baseball BatBaseball BatDamage: 30 HPHotkey: 8 (2x)The only new melee weapon introduced in Worms: DC, the Baseball Bat is used at close range to both damage a worm and send them flying. By aiming the targeting crosshair up or down the player is able to affect the trajectory in which the opposing worms is propelled. Aiming further toward the ground will send the worm a greater distance, while aiming upward will send them higher into the air. Since the weapon's base damage is not that spectacular in and of itself, the Baseball Bat is more commonly used to knock worms into the water.Super SheepSuper SheepDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: 9Being a remarkable specimen within the ovine genus, the Super Sheep is possessed of an ability that others of its kind can only dream of, that being the ability to take flight. Upon pressing the fire button once, the Super Sheep is set loose, and appears to be nothing more than a normal Sheep. When the fire button is pressed again, the fluffy beast shoots straight up into the air where his movements can be directly steered by the player. It is up to this player to direct the fast-moving Sheep missile into enemy worms, where it explodes.Sheep-on-a-RopeSheep-on-a-RopeDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: 9 (2x)A combination of the Sheep weapon and the Ninja Rope, the Sheep-on-a-Rope is a regular-strength Sheep that can be navigated around the environment in much the same way that worms can navigate while using the Ninja Rope. This includes the ability to swing, detach, and reattach before touching the ground. If at any time the Sheep touches the ground without being attached to the rope, it explodes. In Worms: DC's secret Monkey Mode, it is replaced with Kenny-p\u00e5-ett-Rep (Kenny-on-a-Rope), which is functionally identical.Sheep StrikeSheep StrikeDamage: Up to 50 HP per impactHotkey: 9 (3x)Threatening to do in players in with \"mutton from the skies,\" the Sheep Strike is a version of the Air Strike in which missiles have been replaced with volatile bouncing Sheep. Five Sheep in total are dropped over the targeted area, and each one explodes upon contact with the ground. The threat does not end there, though, as each one will then bound into the air and crash into the landscape a second time, causing another explosion. Each individual explosion is weaker than other Sheep weapons, but when combined they are devastating.Old LadyOld LadyDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: 0Possessed of innate combustible properties, the confused Old Lady is a powerful weapon not altogether unlike a walking stick of Dynamite. She is not so much launched as she is set loose to hobble bemusedly along the landscape in search of something only she is aware of. After about ten seconds of ambling and incoherent muttering, the Old Lady explodes, causing considerable damage to any worms nearby. Since the Old Lady cannot be manually detonated by the player, she requires a certain amount of prediction on the player's part.Priceless Ming VasePriceless Ming VaseDamage: Up to 75 HP (initial), up to 50 HP (fragments)Hotkey: 0 (2x)Proving that they have no regard even for fine art, worms have been known to utilize a Priceless Ming Vase or two as weapons of war. It is used, like Dynamite, by dropping it at the desired location, and it allows its user five seconds to retreat before it detonates. The initial explosion causes a great deal of injury, but also sends several shards into the atmosphere that explode upon hitting the ground, causing additional damage. Large gatherings of worms are natural targets for the Ming Vase, as are enclosed ares that can focus its payload.Postal StrikePostal StrikeDamage: Up to 50 HP per impactHotkey: 0 (3x)Invoking the Postal Strike releases a number of deadly letter bombs over a specified zone that drift lethargically to the ground. These epistolary explosives have somewhat larger damage potential than a normal Air Strike, though there is one major caveat: they are heavily affected by wind. This forces players to either use the Postal Strike in calm conditions or attempt to gauge the wind's effect on the weapon's payload in order to adjust its target area appropriately. Despite the extra consideration required, when used well it is very powerful.Nuclear BombNuclear BombDamage: NoneHotkey: 0 (4x)Though it causes no actual damage when activated, the Nuclear Bomb can nonetheless be one of the deadliest weapons in Worms: DC. Setting off a Nuke causes the entire level to sink (or the water level to rise, depending on how you look at it); while this causes no damage in and of itself, any worms near the waterline will be consumed and killed by whatever deadly substance resides at the bottom of that particular stage. This weapon is indiscriminate in who it kills, so it is best used when one's own worms are situated on higher ground.Concrete DonkeyConcrete DonkeyDamage: Up to 100 HP per impactHotkey: 0 (5x)The Concrete Donkey represents the ultimate in lethal force, and as such it is one of the rarest and most coveted weapons in the game. Calling down the Concrete Donkey causes the aforementioned garden ornament to fall vertically through the level at a point chosen by the player. Each time it makes contact with solid ground, it causes an explosion equal in strength to the Holy Hand Grenade, and it proceeds in this fashion until it has reached the bottom of the map. Worms targeted by the Concrete Donkey are very unlikely to survive.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The critical response to Worms: The Director's Cut from the Amiga gaming press was very positive, with Amiga Format and CU Amiga both giving the game a score within the ninetieth percentile. While these reviews acknowledged that the game was essentially an update to Worms rather than an entirely new game, a fact which even prompted Amiga Format to publish a second review score of 45% specifically for those that already own Worms, the cosmetic enhancements, new weapons, and gameplay tweaks were all seen as welcome additions. In spite of these recommendations, Worms: DC reportedly sold only 5,000 copies in total.[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Worms' Main Menu (DOS)[CR]Originally created by Andy Davidson for the Amiga, and later ported to a variety of other systems by Team17, Worms is the first iteration of the long-running Worms series of turn-based strategic artillery games. As in subsequent games, the goal of Worms is to use a team of well-armed annelids to kill worms of opposing human or A.I. players; in each round, the last player with living worms is declared the winner. Worms was first published by Ocean Software Ltd. in 1995, and in addition to its original platform, it has appeared on the Amiga CD32, PC, Game Boy, Genesis, Jaguar, Macintosh, PlayStation, Saturn, and SNES; in fact, it has been ported to more systems than any other Worms game. A version of the title was even considered for Nintendo's Virtual Boy at one point, though Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown stated in 2008 that the Virtual Boy port never truly made it into the development stages due to a sentiment that the platform was \"doomed to failure\".[CR]The DOS version of Worms was followed up by Worms: Reinforcements, an expansion to the original game, in late 1995; the following year Worms and Reinforcements would be released as a single package under the name Worms United. Worms would later be released on Steam in 2011 and GOG.com in 2012, though in both cases the version sold is Worms United, not the original game. After completing Worms Davidson would also head up the development of Worms: The Director's Cut, released in 1997, which was an Amiga-exclusive version of Worms that featured a large number of new weapons and game options not previously seen in other iterations of the game, many of which were adopted in Worms 2, released the same year. Both 2006's Worms: Open Warfare and 2007's Worms are considered remakes of the original Worms due in large part to similarities in their weapon loadouts.[CR]Development[CR]Worms was originally conceived not as a commercial product, but as a distraction for creator Andy Davidson, a fan of local multiplayer games like Bomberman and Super Mario Kart, and his high school friends. It was initially built using borrowed assets from Psygnosis' Lemmings, and the earliest version of Worms was known as Lemartillery as a result. The game eventually became so popular among the students of Davidson's school that it was banned entirely, prompting Davidson to consider the possibility of having his game published. In order to make the game more attractive to would-be publishers, however, the game's graphics had to be reworked, and thus Davidson scrapped the original lemmings on favor of worms, giving this new iteration the name Total Wormage. Davidson was so intent on getting his game published that after high school he decided to forgo the pursuit of higher education in order to do so. While he continued to work on the game, Davidson used the customers of an Amiga store where he worked as a form of playtesting for Total Wormage.[CR]In one of his efforts to get his game noticed, Davidson submitted Total Wormage into a competition held by Amiga Format, a British Amiga magazine. By Davidson's own admission, though, his entry into the contest did not accomplish what he had hoped, as he neither won nor received any mention in the magazine. Although discouraged by this and a number of failed attempts at garnering attention for Total Wormage by mailing copies to publishers and developers, Davidson had one final idea: to take the game to the European Computer Trade Show in London. This would prove to be the turning point in Davidson's fortunes, as while there he demoed the game to Team17, who showed an immediate interest in it. Team17 offered to help Davidson develop and publish the game; much of their work went into porting Worms to other game systems, as the original Amiga version that Davidson had been working on was by this time fairly well-developed. In total, Davidson estimates that he spent about four years of his life in the development of Worms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Worms consists of actions taken by between two and four teams of human- or A.I.-controlled worms on a two-dimensional playing field. The game is turn-based, with each player being able to move a single worm per turn; turns typically end once a worm has either fired a weapon or sustained damage, although they can also end automatically if the allotted time for a turn runs out. From there, play shifts to the next player in the sequence, which is determined randomly at the beginning of gameplay, and that player proceeds in the same fashion. The objective of worms at all times is to cause as much damage to enemy worms as possible while also preserving one's own worms. Each worms starts the round with a certain amount of hit points (typically one hundred), and if their hit points are reduced to zero, they will die, leaving behind a gravestone and creating a small explosion that can harm nearby worms. Worms can also be killed instantaneously by being knocked outside the boundaries of the level or into liquid substances that reside at the bottom of the stage. If a player loses all four of their worms, they are eliminated, and the winner of a given round is the player that survives the match without being eliminated.A Banana Bomb causing widespread destruction. At top, opposing players' health bars can be seen; within the lower HUD, a wind strength indicator (top right) and power bar (bottom right) are visible.[CR]Each player starts the match with an assortment of armaments and utilities in order to aid them in their goal of dominating their opposition. This includes staple weapons such as bazookas and grenades, which can be used frequently, to more powerful weaponry such as homing missiles and dynamite that can only be used a finite number of times. Worms also contains a handful of \"super weapons\" such as banana bombs and explosive sheep, which can only be obtained through periodic weapon crate drops during a match; these items are extremely potent, though incredibly rare to find. Some weapons require that the player be able to accurately gauge the proper weapon trajectory and launch power necessary to hit a target, which can be further complicated by the inclusion of wind conditions that can affect certain projectiles while in flight. In addition to weapons, Worms also offers a number of movement utilities designed more for defense or traversal than offense; this includes items like ninja ropes and teleporters, which allow different ways of moving around the environment, and items like blow torches and pneumatic drills that can carve through obstructions.[CR]Environments in Worms are completely destructible, and almost all weapons cause some amount of deformation to the terrain. Over time, this reduces the size of the overall play area, making defensive positioning increasingly difficult while simultaneously increasing the danger that players will fall or be forced off of the map. In order to help make the game more replayable, levels in Worms are also randomly generated, and prior to a match players can cycle through maps indefinitely until they find one to their liking. Several other aspects of the game are adjustable as well, though not all of these variables have a dramatic affect on gameplay. Team and individual worm names can be changed, starting hit point totals can be set between seventy-five and five hundred points, and the intelligence level of A.I. opponents can be tweaked. The availability of all of the game's default weapons can be tailored to suit personal tastes, and Sudden Death, a late-game stalemate breaker that reduces all worms to one hit point, can be made to occur sooner, later, or not at all. A number of other variables exist as well, such as default worm placement and turn length, and an optional Banzai mode is also included which makes explosions even more destructive.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The Worms arsenal includes more than twenty weapons and utilities that vary in strength and purpose. All but three of these tools are given automatically to the player during a match, while the others are designated as \"super weapons,\" and must be collected from randomized weapon crates (although these crates can also contain other weapons or booby traps). A wide variety of different armaments are represented in Worms, including melee weapons, firearms, and a variety of explosives that may be thrown, dropped, propelled by rockets, or conveyed in less-than-orthodox ways. Some usable items are classified as utilities, and while these objects may cause damage to enemies in some cases, the intent of utility items is generally to offer worms additional mobility or defensive options. Weapons can be selected either by right-clicking in order to bring up a weapon selection panel or by hitting their associated function key.BazookaBazookaDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 One of the go-to weapons of Worms, the Bazooka fires a single explosive shell in a trajectory and at a velocity determined by the player. Provided that it successfully finds its target, it does a solid amount of damage and causes a fair amount of concussive force as well. It also destroys a sizable chunk of the surrounding landscape. Bazooka usage is unlimited by default, and it can be extremely useful to skilled players. Its course is heavily influenced by wind, however, requiring some amount of compensation in gusty conditions.Homing MissileHoming MissileDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 (2x) The Homing Missile is similar to the Bazooka in many respects, though it has one crucial difference. Prior to being fired, the player is able to select a point on the map that the Homing Missile will zero in on after it takes flight. Though it's tracking capability is far from perfect, with foresight it can be used to hit almost any target that is not hidden underground. Due to the increased accuracy over the Bazooka, it is easier to propel worms in a desired direction with it, though just like the Bazooka it is affected by wind.GrenadeGrenadeDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F2 Being equal in strength to the Bazooka, the Grenade is another of Worms' staple weapons, and similarly it is a deadly weapon in the hands of a seasoned player. One of the Grenade's main advantages is the fact that it is not affected by wind at all, and thus two Grenades thrown at the same angle and strength will always have the same trajectory. A Grenade also does not explode on impact, but instead possesses an adjustable fuse that automatically detonates it after a preselected number of seconds (between one and five).Cluster BombCluster BombDamage: Up to 25 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Cluster Bomb takes after the Grenade in terms of its low susceptibility to wind and adjustable fuse length. Once the fuse is detonated, it splits into five distinct explosives that scatter and fall to the ground, causing additional damage to any worms within a short vicinity of the initial blast. While each individual explosion is less damaging than the force of a Grenade, combined they can cause far greater damage. The natural target for a Cluster Bomb is not a single worm but a gathering of enemy worms situated fairly close to each other.Banana BombBanana BombDamage: Up to 75 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Banana Bomb can be thought of as a version of the Cluster Bomb, though a far more destructive one. After a Banana Bomb has been thrown and its timer expires, five deadly bananas are unleashed that fly into the air and explode immediately upon contact with the ground. Each banana is akin to a single stick of Dynamite, and the combined detonation can kill several worms, or even an entire team of worms, relatively easily. Due to its potentially enormous area of effect, the Banana Bomb is a frequent source of self-injury.ShotgunShotgunDamage: Up to 25 HP per shotHotkey: F3 The Shotgun is one of three point-and-shoot firearm weapons in Worms, and its main distinction over its brethren is the ability to shoot twice in a single turn. Even though the damage it causes with each shot is somewhat on the low side, it affords some strategic possibilities that are not possible with other weapons. A player can use it, for example, to attack two different worms in a single turn even if they are not close to one another; alternately, it can be used to attack once before using the remainder of the turn to seek a defensive position.UziUziDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) Using the Uzi unleashes a short stream of bullets in a specified direction. If all hits connect, it causes a significant amount of damage, and there are other benefits to the weapon as well, as it creates a significant amount of pushback that can be used to propel enemy worms into hazards such as mines or water. The downside of this property is that it is at times difficult to get the maximum amount of damage from the weapon. Perhaps the best way to ensure this is to use the Uzi against enemies that have their backs against a wall.MinigunMinigunDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) The Minigun is essentially a more deadly version of the Uzi, and as such its applications are fairly similar. Like the Uzi, it is unlikely that all bullets will hit their target unless said worm is pinned against a solid surface, though the damage boost of the Minigun makes this drawback less of an issue. It is an extremely good tool for pushing worms around the landscape and into peril. Because of its wide bullet spread, the Minigun is best used from close range, though care should be taken, as it is possible to damage oneself with it.Fire PunchFire PunchDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 Upon activating the Fire Punch ability, a worm will unleash a Street Fighter-inspired Dragon Punch that damages an opponent and sends them flying across the map. The trajectory of the Fire Punch's knockback is arguably its most advantageous attribute, as the actual injury caused by the attack is somewhat modest. More often than not, the Fire Punch is either used to knock an opponent off of a precipice, hopefully to their death, or as a stylish way of finishing off a worm that is nearly dead already. It can also strike worms above the player.Dragon BallDragon BallDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 (2x) The Dragon Ball ability creates a short-range fireball that damages the first worm it touches. It is similar to the Fire Punch in many ways, and even does the same amount of damage on hit, though it is more horizontally oriented. This goes not only for the attack itself, which travels horizontally as opposed to the Fire Punch's vertical movement, but also the result of the attack. Enemies hit by a Dragon Ball will be thrown a great distance but will not gain much altitude, which can be used to great effect to push worms into mines or water.DynamiteDynamiteDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 A simple yet undeniably powerful weapon, the Dynamite stick is a dropped explosive device with an extremely large blast radius. Since it must be placed manually, the user is required afterwards to beat a hasty retreat lest they fall victim to their own destructive predilections. It leaves a very large crater in its wake, and any worms within its range when it detonates sustain heavy damage. Dynamite is the most potent weapon in Worms that is not considered to be a \"super weapon,\" and by default it is available in very limited supply.MineMineDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Deployed in the same manner as the Dynamite stick, the Mine may be a step down in terms of power, but it has uses that Dynamite does not. It can of course be placed directly on top of a worm so that it will activate and explode immediately, but it can also be used as a defensive tool, which can be particularly useful in securing underground tunnels. Against A.I opponents, its defensive utility is somewhat diminished, as computer worms tend to move around far less than human ones, reducing the chances of mine activation significantly.SheepSheepDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Seemingly innocuous at a glance, the Sheep is in truth one of the deadliest weapons in Worms. Once released, the Sheep will amble along while trying to bound over any obstacles it might encounter. When the fire button is pressed a second time, the Sheep will detonate, creating a blast equal to Dynamite in terms of its size and lethality. The Sheep negates one of the primary drawbacks of Dynamite, that being that players must place it themselves; Sheep can have some difficulty navigating uneven terrain, though, so flat surfaces work best.Air StrikeAir StrikeDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F6 Calling in an Air Strike orders an aircraft to perform a bombing run over a targeted area. When initiated, the player is asked to select a target zone in a manner similar to the target selection of the Homing Missile; in the case of the Air Strike, the selected point is then used as the bull's eye for an immediate missile bombardment. Explosives fall in a fairly large area around the target, making it an attractive way to cause heavy damage to a large cluster of worms, though it does require a fairly clear path to its target in order to be effective.TeleportTeleportDamage: NoneHotkey: F6 (2x) The Worms equivalent of a Get Out of Jail Free card, the Teleport instantaneously transports a single worm to any point on the map the player so desires. This can be used in situations where a worm is surrounded by hostile worms, and it is also a popular way to collect weapon crates. Using a teleport immediately ends the worm's turn, so it is important to ensure that doing so will not leave the player vulnerable to attack in subsequent turns. As the most powerful movement tool in the game, its use is severely restricted by default.Blow TorchBlow TorchDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 The Blow Torch allows a worm to carve into the environment either horizontally or at an angle. While it does cause a pittance of damage to worms in its path, the primary purpose of the Blow Torch is in tunneling through the map to reach new areas or building underground defensive structures that shield worms against attack. This is a particularly vexing problem for opposing worms, as burrowed worms can't be attacked easily in many scenarios, often forcing players to waste several turns in an attempt to infiltrate or destroy enemy defenses.DrillDrillDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 (2x) Unlike the Blow Torch, the Drill burrows into the environment in only one direction: down. Though this is not intended for offensive purposes, it has more damage potential than the Blow Torch, as a worm can in some cases become stuck in the hole created by the Drill and continue to take damage. Unfortunately, worms who use the Drill to escape enemy fire are more vulnerable to attack than those hidden in horizontal tunnels. This is because it is a fairly simple matter to drop a Grenade, Cluster Bomb, or other ordinance on their heads.Ninja RopeNinja RopeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 Aside from walking and jumping, the Ninja Rope is arguably the most important means of locomotion in Worms. Casting a Ninja Rope will attach a worm to any solid surface via rope, and from there the player is free to extend and retract the rope and also swing back and forth to gain momentum. In this way players are able to rapidly traverse large sections of the map and access areas that might otherwise be inaccessible. Most importantly, using the Ninja Rope does not end the player's turn, leaving worms free to attack their foes afterwards.BungeeBungeeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 (2x) Having the Bungee utility selected allows the player the freedom to walk off of cliffs without fear of sustaining fall damage. Dropping from a precipice activates the item automatically, and from there the player can control their movements on the Bungee cord. It behaves somewhat like a springier version of the Ninja Rope, and like the Ninja Rope the player can detach from it at any time by hitting the fire button. The player's turn does not end once the worm dismounts the cord, so the remainder of their turn can be played out as normal.GirderGirderDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 Offering a number of strategic possibilities, the Girder utility is the only usable item in Worms that creates a terrain feature rather than destroying one. Using a Girder allows the player to place a long solid metal beam that acts like all other solid objects in the game. For allied worms, this can be a useful means of protection or a way to assist mobility, and it can also be used as a way to restrict the movements of enemy worms. Girders can have their orientation rotated at will and their size adjusted prior to being placed on the map.KamikazeKamikazeDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F10 True to its name, the Kamikaze attack is a one-way proposition for any worm that chooses to utilize it. The idea is that the worm in question will fly forth and explode violently, causing damage to enemy worms while sending them flying. Since worms are the player's most valued resource, it is a tool to be avoided if at all possible. The ideal candidate for a Kamikaze attack is a worm that is near death and would likely die before their next turn anyway. Even so, it is usually only worth considering if the blast will affect multiple worms.ProdProdDamage: NoneHotkey: F11 The Prod is the ultimate Worms insult: an attack that does no damage. By standing next to another worm and issuing a Prod command, the player's worm will give a gently nudge to the adjacent worm that will push them forward ever so slightly. Nothing more, nothing less. The only practical application of this ability is in the event that an enemy worm can be pushed off of or into something, and even then there are weapons that can accomplish the same while also causing damage directly. It is used primarily to humiliate an opponent.Skip GoSkip GoDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 (2x) As it implies, Skip Go allows a player to prematurely end their worm's turn without taking any further action. This can be useful if a worm has no viable means of attack or if the player simply wishes to force their opponent's hand. If a worm is burrowed safely underground, for instance, a player might decide to skip their turn rather than risk retaliation by leaving and going on the offensive. Skipping a turn also has the effect of allowing more turns before the onset of Sudden Death, which is activated based on play time rather than turn count.SurrenderSurrenderDamage: NoneHotkey: F10 (2x) By selecting Surrender and pressing the fire button a player can at any point raise the proverbial white flag and remove themselves from play voluntarily. In a two-player match, this ends the round automatically, though if two or more players remain after a Surrender then play will continue until only one team remains. It should be noted that surrendered worms will remain on the playing field even after they are no longer in competition; aside from their lack of any agency in the match, these worms behave as they normally would.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Worms was fairly well-received upon its release in 1995, and many critics commending it for having easy-to-grasp yet strategic gameplay, a humorous, lighthearted presentation, and a great deal of customization options and replayability. The original version received a great deal of positive attention from the Amiga gaming press, with a large number of review scores falling within the ninetieth percentile. Ironically, Amiga Format, the very same British publication that had failed to acknowledge Davidson's game when he submitted it into their yearly Amiga game competition, issued a glowing post-release review of Worms in their 1995 Christmas issue, saying that it \"thoroughly deserves to be a real smash.\"[CR]",

                "plot": "[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zool is a platformer originally developed by Gremlin Graphics for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to multiple other platforms. It follows  Zool, a ninja from the Nth Dimension who has crash landed on a mysterious planet and must traverse many different levels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Zool is side-scrolling platforming gameplay in which the player's aim is merely to reach the end of the level, where a gold coin would be collected. Obstacles and enemies litter the 2D worlds, and the game is known for being very difficult. Zool has the ability to perform jumps, punches, kicks, sliding tackles, fire a \"magic cannon\" weapon and perform 4 different magic spells. The magic spells vary greatly, and include an invincibility spell, a fire blast spell which kills all enemies on screen, a duplication spell which creates a second Zool, doubling the players fire power and one that increases his jumping ability. Zool can also climb walls by clinging onto the wall, and jumping upwards before clinging to it again.[CR]At intervals within a level there are checkpoints, which are different items in each world. Upon passing the point it will activate, and if the player is killed, Zool will respawn at the checkpoint. Zool can take 4 hits of damage before dying, and can replenish his life with flying hearts gained from killing some enemies. There is a score system which serves no purpose other than for players to attempt to achieve high scores. Killing enemies and collecting collectibles are the main methods of gaining points but they can also be gained from a variety of methods depending on the level. For example walking on the piano in the music world both plays a tune, and gives the player some points.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]There are 7 different worlds in Zool, each with varying environments, enemies, collectibles etc. Each world has three levels.Sweet World[CR]The sweet world is a candy based world full of yummy treats for Zool to collect and kill. Enemies include jellies, bees and even a Bertie Basset. There are spike pits and spike creatures on walls and chocolate rivers which slow down Zool's movement. Rafts float on the rivers which can be used to traverse the rivers without slowing of movement.Music World[CR]The music world is a world of music. Musical instruments can be the players friends or enemies. Walking Cymbals and Drums are among Zool's enemies, while points can be gained by making music from walking along a giant music keyboard.Fruit & Veg World[CR]The Fruit & Veg world is a giant garden, where fruit can both help and hinder Zool. Brussel sprouts, carrots and grapes are the enemies. Other fruits, along with chopped off carrot tops can be collected to gain points.Tool World[CR]Tool world is full of lethal tools. From hammers trying to hit him, to drills trying to drill him, Zool is not safe in this dangerous world. Greased platforms hinder his movement and makes him slide down drops.Toy World[CR]The toy world features many dangerous toy based enemies, from marbles to toy tanks.Fun Fair World[CR]The fun fair world is anything but fun for Zool. Lethal hammers and candy-floss are some of Zool's enemies in this world. There is even an arcade cabinet in the amusement arcades which allows the players to play Zool.Shoot 'em Up World[CR]The seventh world is hidden through the other levels, and takes a departure from the platforming gameplay, and is a space shooter.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Zool has multiple options for the background music in the game. The option to turn the music off altogether exists, along with 4 unique music styles, Rave, Rock, Green and Funk.[CR]",

New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks. [CR]On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.",
