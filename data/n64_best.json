It didn't have as many classic games as the PlayStation, the blocky graphics and fuzzy textures look a little terrible today, and the controller was an acquired taste. But don't dismiss the system just yet.[CR]The N64 was host to many of the best games from the second half of the '90s. Its games defined and introduced concepts of 3D game design still used today. And for all the games on our countdown of the (newly updated) 50 best, the gameplay still holds up, even if the visuals occasionally falter. Let's start with the still unique...",

The title launched something of a golden age for publisher Acclaim, which--along with frequent dev partner Iguana Entertainment--would favor the N64 with some of its most technically accomplished titles.[CR]It's easy to forget what a risk Turok represented for Acclaim, then (as always) one flop away from bankruptcy. As one of the first M-rated games for the console, the game earned its rating with deep-red gouts gushing from downed, writhing enemies. Mario 64 this wasn't. The game pushed its chosen genre as well, incorporating divisive platforming elements that foreshadowed the likes of Metroid Prime. Acclaim would build on Turok's success with sleeper hits like Shadow Man and Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M., as well as later Turok titles. But the dark, bloody original stands out as a genuine N64 revelation.",

However, the lack of a AAA automotive sim didn't stop Nintendo's platform from hosting a handful of top-notch arcade-style racers, a category in which Excitebike 64 definitely deserves mention.[CR]Following on from the similarly addictive Wave Race 64 and 1080\u00b0 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64 upped the ante by resuscitating a beloved NES-era racer for the particles-'n'-jaggies era. The exacting controls left little room for error, and with the game arriving late in the console's lifespan, many gave the demanding racer a pass. Those who persisted were rewarded with a tight racer which retained that old-school flavor while branching out into adventurous new game modes.",

Beyond all of that, though, what the game had that many others didn\u2019t was originality. There simply aren\u2019t many games like Jet Force Gemini, and that\u2019s a damn shame.",

Tennis also saw the return of Birdo and Daisy to the series (along with the notorious Waluigi). Additionally, it was one of the few games that allowed for connectivity between the N64 game and its Game Boy Color counterpart, a feature Nintendo would come to embrace more in the future.",

And besides, it isn't the one with Navi or the Water Temple. Phew.[CR]But you can be sure there's lots else to get confounded by here. The game requires that you've plugged an Expansion Pak into your N64--and an extra one into your brain. A dark fairytale of a story brings together repeating timelines and impending apocalypse, in an alternate version of Hyrule in which everything's just a little bit delightfully off.

Dream matches like Mario vs. Link or Pikachu vs. Samus played out over and over in levels slathered in Nintendo love and nostalgia.[CR]Fighting game purists may complain that SSB is a cheap, shallow affair that has no right being called a fighter, but the fans know better. The cheapness, the insanity, the unbalanced nature of the fights, all of it adds to the total chaotic pleasure of the whole thing. In no time at all SSB became one of Nintendo\u2019s most successful franchises, thanks in no small part to Super Smash Bros. fans being some of the most dedicated in the world.",

Said castle offered hours of hidden areas and Easter eggs tucked away in its many rooms. It still blows us away that Nintendo, in one game, could make a brilliant 3D adventure when so many still have trouble getting it right today. Granted, the early 3D visuals are getting on in years, but the controls, level design, and open-endedness of each area make it a must-play even now.",

The Z-targeting and combat set the standard for years, and the soundtrack still rings in our ears to this day. Later Zelda games further improved and refined Ocarina's formula, but it was this title that proved such a game could not only exist, but be this extremely good.",
